# 🚀 Efficient Alpha Submission Framework for WorldQuant Brain

👋 Hello WorldQuant Brain Consultants! Today, I'd like to share a framework I've developed to optimize alpha submission. As we all know, submitting alphas can be time-consuming, from checking correlations to waiting for submission results. I hope this approach will help you save significant time and increase your submission success rate.

## 🔄 Framework Overview

The framework consists of 3 main stages:

### 1. 🎯 Initial Filtering

Using the API to quickly filter potential alphas according to specific criteria (for submission or research/improvement). This saves time compared to checking each alpha individually.

### 2. 📊 Inner Correlation Check Stage

After obtaining the list of potential alphas, we check correlations between them:

1. **PnL Check Method**
   - Get daily PnL for each alpha
   - Create correlation matrix to compare all pairs
   - Use parallel processing to speed up the process
2. **Filtering Method**
   - Correlation threshold: 0.6999 (close to system's 0.7 threshold)
   - When 2 alphas have correlation > 0.6999, keep the one with higher IS Fitness
   - Sort by IS Fitness in descending order

💡 Pro tip: Using 0.6999 instead of 0.7 provides a safety margin, avoiding rechecks later.

### 3. ✨ Final Correlation Check and Submit Stage

This is the most crucial stage. I have a special tip for checking self-correlation:

1. **Correlation Check with Local Database**
   - **🔑 Breakthrough point** : Instead of sending self-correlation check requests to the system, store daily PnL of all submitted alphas in a local database
   - When checking self-correlation for new alphas, compare PnL with local database
   - Benefits:
   - ⚡ Saves significant API waiting time
   - 📈 Doesn't consume system correlation check quota
   - 🔄 Can check multiple alphas simultaneously
   - 🎯 Predict self-correlation results before submission
2. **Detailed Check Process**
   - Get daily PnL of alpha to be checked
   - Compare with PnL of all alphas in local database
   - If correlation < 0.7 with all database alphas, high chance of passing self-correlation check
   - When alpha is successfully submitted, automatically add its PnL to database for future use
   - Call Prod correlation API for this list to get submission-ready alphas
3. **Submit System**
   - Only submit alphas that passed local database check and prod-correlation
   - Monitor and confirm submission status, then save PnL locally

## 💾 Tips for Managing Local Database

1. **Local Database Management**
   - 📁 Organize PnL storage of submitted alphas
   - 🔄 Regularly update database with new alphas after submission
   - 📊 Can categorize alphas by region, strategy for easy management
   - 💾 Regular database backup to prevent data loss

## 🎓 Conclusion

This is the framework I'm using to optimize alpha submission. I hope these insights will help you in your alpha research process.

Great post  [NP85445](/hc/en-us/profiles/10432442381591-NP85445) , and thank you!

I also think the idea to keep a database for returns for local correlation checks is brilliant. Just out of curiosity, did you implement a robust search functionality for your alphas in the database? I use pandas only, which can be cumbersome. Maybe your thoughts on this?

Looking forward to your next post.

### 评论 #6 (作者: AM71073, 时间: 1年前)

Awesome framework! I love how you've structured the process to optimize alpha submissions and save time. The idea of using a local database for PnL correlation checks is especially clever—it's a great way to avoid redundant checks and minimize waiting times.

A quick tip to enhance this could be using a rolling window for tracking the alpha's performance and adding a volatility adjustment to the fitness evaluation. This way, you're accounting for changes in market conditions or strategy shifts that might impact an alpha's robustness.

Looking forward to your next posts on alpha optimization and the upcoming tips to increase alpha pass rates!

Thanks for sharing your approach!

**Great framework!**  🚀

I love how you’ve structured this process to optimize alpha submissions. The use of a local database for self-correlation checks is a brilliant idea—it’ll definitely save a lot of time and reduce the reliance on the system’s API. The detailed steps for filtering, checking correlations, and organizing the local database will make the workflow much more efficient.

I also appreciate the tip on setting the correlation threshold to 0.6999 for extra safety; that's a clever way to avoid future issues with rechecks. I’m definitely going to implement some of these practices in my own alpha submission process!

Looking forward to more insights and your upcoming posts on alpha research optimization. Thanks for sharing this valuable framework! 😊

### 评论 #10 (作者: TL60820, 时间: 1年前)

Regarding the correlation check: I see you’ve set the correlation threshold at 0.6999 as a safety margin. In your experience, how do you handle cases where alphas have very volatile or unpredictable PnL patterns? Do you ever adjust the threshold based on these outliers, or is the 0.6999 threshold consistent across all scenarios?

### 评论 #15 (作者: YC82708, 时间: 1年前)

This article introduces a practical framework for optimizing the alpha submission process at WorldQuant Brain. I was really impressed by the structured approach outlined in the framework, particularly the focus on efficiency at each stage. The initial filtering process saves time by narrowing down the pool of potential alphas before deeper analysis begins. The inner correlation check, where the correlation matrix of alphas is used to filter out redundant ones based on performance, is a clever way to ensure that only the most promising alphas are considered. The final stage's breakthrough method of using a local database to track PnL and check correlations before submission is a brilliant time-saver, reducing the need for repeated system checks. Overall, this framework highlights the importance of both technical efficiency and strategic filtering in optimizing the alpha submission process. The tips for managing a local database and the emphasis on collaboration within the community make this approach feel highly adaptable and helpful for others in the field.

### 评论 #20 (作者: TL60820, 时间: 1年前)

How can you effectively handle rate limits when sending requests to the Brain API, and what strategies can be implemented to avoid hitting the limit? For example, how can you make use of the rate limit information provided in the response headers, such as  `X-RateLimit-Remaining`  and  `X-RateLimit-Reset` , to manage the number of requests made? What are the best practices for implementing backoff and retry logic when the rate limit is reached? Additionally, how can batching requests, distributing requests over time, or using multiple API keys help in optimizing API usage while staying within the allowed limits?
