Hello Community,

To implement templates on  [option dataset categories](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets?category=option&delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=USA&universe=TOP3000) , you can focus on comparing the net value of Greeks between call and put options across companies within the same group.

Hypothesis: The core idea is that if the net value of a Greek (difference between call and put Greeks or vice versa) stands out compared to other companies within the same industry or group, it may signal an upcoming increase in the stock price.

[group_operator](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/data-and-operators/operators#group-operators) (<put_greek> - <call_greek>, <grouping_data>)

Implementation:

- Put_greek and call_greek represent the specific Greek calculations (such as Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega) for the put and call option contracts, respectively. These Greeks offer insights into the sensitivity of an option's price to various factors like the underlying asset's price, time decay, and volatility.

- By comparing the net Greek value (put_greek - call_greek or call_greek - put_greek) across companies within the same grouping (e.g., industry, sector), you can identify outliers or leaders that may have a potential edge or undervalued options.

Hints to refine this Alpha template, consider the following:

- Utilize various option Greeks: While Delta might be the most straightforward to start with, incorporating Gamma for curvature or Theta for time decay could reveal more nuanced insights.
- Group Data Fields: Use meaningful grouping fields, especially those that provide a fair comparison base.
- Neutralization: Apply neutralization techniques to control for market-wide effects or sector-specific trends that might overshadow individual stock performances.

Here's a mini challenge: Can you think of different ways to expand this template? Comment below to share your idea!

Hey YW42946, great template! One way to expand it could be to consider different time horizons for calculating the Greeks. For example, short-term vs long-term Greeks might show varying sensitivities and uncover more potential signals. Also, combining multiple Greeks in a weighted manner based on their importance in different market conditions could add more depth. Another idea is to use different grouping methods like by market cap ranges instead of just industry. That might give a different perspective on the outliers and undervalued options.

Great idea! Focusing on the net value of Greeks (e.g., delta, gamma, vega, theta) between call and put options within the same group can be a powerful method for predicting stock price movements. Your hypothesis suggests that discrepancies in these Greeks might indicate market expectations or imbalances, which could lead to price movements.

### Implementation Outline:

To implement this in a trading strategy, you can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Greeks** :
   - **Call Greeks** : These are the options Greeks for call options (e.g., delta, gamma, vega, theta).
   - **Put Greeks** : These are the corresponding Greeks for put options.
   - For each Greek, you’ll calculate the  **net value** : the difference between the put Greek and the call Greek, such as:
   - **Net Delta**  =  `Put Delta - Call Delta`
   - **Net Gamma**  =  `Put Gamma - Call Gamma`
   - **Net Vega**  =  `Put Vega - Call Vega`
   - **Net Theta**  =  `Put Theta - Call Theta`
2. **Group by Industry/Group** :
   - Use the  **grouping_data**  to segment stocks by industry or sector. This could be done by the  **group_operator** , which will compare the Greeks within each group (e.g., sector, industry, etc.).
   - The  **group_operator**  function will help control for group-level effects, ensuring that the net Greek value is evaluated relative to others in the same industry, rather than across the entire market.
3. **Calculate Net Greek Value** :
   - **`group_operator(<put_greek> - <call_greek>, <grouping_data>)`** : This operator calculates the net value of the Greek (e.g., delta, gamma) for each stock relative to others in the same group.
   - If the net value of a Greek (e.g., delta) for a particular stock is significantly higher or lower than the group median, it could indicate that options market participants have a strong bias toward calls or puts, which may precede stock price movement.
4. **Hypothesis Testing** :
   - The hypothesis is that if the net value of a Greek stands out significantly compared to other companies in the same industry or group, it could signal an upcoming move in the stock price.
   - A high net delta, for example, could indicate strong bullish sentiment for that stock, as more calls are being bought compared to puts, which may signal upward price pressure.
   - Similarly, a high net gamma or vega could reflect heightened volatility expectations.
5. **Portfolio Construction** :
   - **Long/Short Signal** : Based on the ranking of the net Greek values within each group:
   - **Long positions** : If a stock’s net Greek value (for a specific Greek) is significantly higher than its group, it could indicate a bullish signal, suggesting that the stock might outperform.
   - **Short positions** : If a stock’s net Greek value is significantly lower than its group, it could signal a bearish outlook, indicating potential underperformance.
   - You can then proceed with the same process of ranking, constructing a long/short portfolio, and rebalancing periodically.

### Example Template for Net Delta:

Here’s how you could implement this strategy for  **net delta** :

python

Copy code

`group_operator(<put_delta> - <call_delta>, <grouping_data>)
`

You can replace  `<put_delta>`  and  `<call_delta>`  with the actual delta values for put and call options, respectively, and  `<grouping_data>`  with the industry or sector classification of the companies.

### Benefits of This Approach:

- **Market Sentiment Reflection** : This approach reflects market sentiment via options prices and can capture hidden insights about stock movements based on the Greeks, which are not always directly observable in stock price movements alone.
- **Industry Control** : By grouping stocks based on industry or sector, you ensure that the comparison of Greeks is done within similar companies, helping to neutralize industry-wide effects and focus on stock-specific signals.
- **Advanced Risk Management** : The Greeks provide insights into the risk and sensitivity of options positions, which can be leveraged to enhance predictions on stock price movements.

### Final Thoughts:

This approach can be an excellent addition to an alpha model, providing a unique perspective based on options market behavior. If you want to further refine the model, you could combine multiple Greeks or introduce additional filtering criteria (e.g., liquidity, volatility) to enhance the predictive power.

How can we incorporate multiple Greeks (e.g., Delta, Gamma, Theta) into the analysis in a meaningful way? Should we weight them differently or combine them into a single metric  also would using ml based grouping or fundamentals based grouping be more important or is it the data field that would be the major player.

**Hey everyone! To incorporate multiple Greeks meaningfully, you could consider creating a composite score. Maybe give more weight to the Greeks that are more relevant in the current market conditions. For example, in a volatile market, Vega might get a higher weight. As for grouping, both ML - based and fundamentals - based have their merits. ML - based can capture complex patterns, while fundamentals - based provides a more traditional view. The data field is crucial too as it's the foundation of your analysis.**

This template provides a great foundation for leveraging option Greeks in alpha generation. One way to expand this could be to incorporate a time-series aspect, such as comparing the change in Greek values over time. For example, analyzing how a company's Greek values change during specific periods (e.g., earnings season or market events) could offer insights into potential price movements. Additionally, integrating volatility skew or historical implied volatility data might help refine predictions. It could also be interesting to combine option Greeks with sentiment data for a more comprehensive view of market sentiment. Looking forward to more innovative ideas from the community!
