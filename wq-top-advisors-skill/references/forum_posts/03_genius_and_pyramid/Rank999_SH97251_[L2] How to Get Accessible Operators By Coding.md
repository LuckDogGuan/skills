## 帖子正文

Hello all, since Genius changed the rule of operators, different users have different combination of operators, I wrote a function to get user's operators. The output would be a dataframe if you call this function in your python notebook, and it will be saved as a csv file for future usage. Here follows the code:

```

```

```

def get_operators(s):

url=" [https://api.worldquantbrain.com/operators](https://api.worldquantbrain.com/operators) "

s.auth =s.auth

# add headers

headers= {

'Accept': 'application/json;version=2.0',

'Content-Type': 'application/json',

'authority': 'api.worldquantbrain.com',

'origin': ' [https://platform.worldquantbrain.com](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com) ',

'referer': ' [https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/operators](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/operators) '

}

s.headers.update(headers)

try:

result=s.get(url)

print(f"Status Code: {result.status_code}")

ifresult.status_code ==200:

data=result.json()

# list to df

df=pd.DataFrame(data)

print(f"get {len(df)} operators")

returndf

else:

print(f"Error: Status code {result.status_code}")

print(f"Response content: {result.text}")

# print errors

print(f"Request headers: {result.request.headers}")

print(f"Auth info present: {s.auth isnotNone}")

returnpd.DataFrame()

exceptExceptionase:

print(f"Error fetching operators: {e}")

ifhasattr(e, 'response'):

print(f"Response content: {e.response.text}")

returnpd.DataFrame()

operators_df = get_operators(s)

operators_df.to_csv("user_operators.csv")

```

I dont understand why there is no indents when I copied my code here, so plz just use AI tools to correct the indents issues here.

Thank you for sharing your insights. I also use this tool in combination with the tool to pull all alpha submissions from the quarter, then compare them to identify operators that haven't been submitted yet. I highly appreciate your contribution to the community and will add my suggestions as well.

Here’s your code with proper indentation and syntax corrections:

```
import pandas as pd

def get_operators(s):
    url = "https://api.worldquantbrain.com/operators"

    # Add headers
    headers = {
        'Accept': 'application/json;version=2.0',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'authority': 'api.worldquantbrain.com',
        'origin': 'https://platform.worldquantbrain.com',
        'referer': 'https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/operators'
    }
    s.headers.update(headers)

    try:
        result = s.get(url)
        print(f"Status Code: {result.status_code}")

        if result.status_code == 200:
            data = result.json()
            # List to DataFrame
            df = pd.DataFrame(data)
            print(f"Fetched {len(df)} operators")
            return df
        else:
            print(f"Error: Status code {result.status_code}")
            print(f"Response content: {result.text}")
            # Print errors
            print(f"Request headers: {result.request.headers}")
            print(f"Auth info present: {s.auth is not None}")
            return pd.DataFrame()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching operators: {e}")
        if hasattr(e, 'response'):
            print(f"Response content: {e.response.text}")
        return pd.DataFrame()

# Fetch and save operators
operators_df = get_operators(s)
if not operators_df.empty:
    operators_df.to_csv("user_operators.csv", index=False)
    print("Operators saved to 'user_operators.csv'")
else:
    print("No operators data to save.")

```

### Key Changes:

1. Corrected indentation to ensure proper nesting of code blocks.
2. Fixed syntax issues:
   - `ifresult`  →  `if result`
   - `returndf`  →  `return df`
   - `returnpd.DataFrame()`  →  `return pd.DataFrame()`
   - `ifhasattr(e, 'response'):`  →  `if hasattr(e, 'response'):`
3. Added  `index=False`  in  `to_csv`  for cleaner CSV output.
4. Included a check to ensure the DataFrame isn't empty before saving.

This code should now run correctly in your Python notebook. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Hey! Thank u so much! I've always struggled with the indent of this platform.

### 评论 #9 (作者: TW77745, 时间: 1 year ago)

This function is a brilliant way to fetch personalized operators dynamically! It handles API integration well, saves the results as a CSV for future use, and includes detailed error logging for debugging. With indents corrected, it becomes even more readable and functional. Enhancements like handling authentication fallback, pagination for large operator lists, or adding a delay to avoid API rate limits could make it even more robust. A great tool for customizing Genius workflows!

### 评论 #10 (作者: TL60820, 时间: 1 year ago)

I recently fetched data through the API and observed that there has been a discrepancy in the number of operators retrieved. The last time I ran the fetch process, there were 183 operators in the dataset. However, upon running it again now, the count has reduced to 182. I am trying to determine if there has been a recent deletion or change that could explain the missing operator. Could someone confirm if an operator was removed or if there might be an issue in how I’m retrieving the data?

Hello there, just use some simple code to compare the different operators in two versions of alphas. I have my version of it:

```

new_ops = get_operators_name(s)
print(new_ops)

extra_ops = []
for op in old_ops:
    if op in new_ops:
        continue
    else:
        extra_ops.append(op)

extra_ops

```

please notice that the old operators and updated operators are both in lists.

Thank you for sharing! You could also update the data management and storage section. Although the API results are saved to a CSV file, for large datasets or faster retrieval needs, you might consider using a database instead of a CSV file. This helps optimize querying and long-term data management, especially when you need to process, search, or analyze the data later.

- **Industry, Sector, or Size Neutralization** : By neutralizing factors such as  **sector** ,  **industry** , or  **size** , you can ensure that the factors are not overly sensitive to these systematic effects. This helps in reducing common exposures that might lead to high correlation.
- **Group Neutralization** : Using neutralization techniques, such as  `group_coalesce` , helps eliminate correlations related to factors like  **market capitalization** ,  **geographic region** , or  **sector** .

- **Use Different Factor Combinations** : Combine factors in various ways to capture diverse relationships. For instance, combining  **momentum**  with  **value**  and  **volatility**  can help reduce overlap and correlation between them.
- **Rotating Factor Models** : Apply different sets of factors across different periods, or dynamically select factors based on current market conditions. This can help avoid periods where certain factors become highly correlated due to macroeconomic or market events.

When your Genius level restricts access to Operators, you'll only be able to use the OPs you're authorized for. 
You can find the list of OPs you do have access to here: Learn > Operators. 
For any OPs you don't have access to, they will no longer be visible to you! Currently, if you haven't saved this list, Brain hasn't made it publicly available again. 
I also hope Brain will publish more detailed information, including a link containing all OPs, and links containing OPs specific to each level. It would give consultants a more comprehensive overview.

Evaluating smaller subsets or sub-universes of the market allows for more granular insights and strategy optimization. This enables you to tailor your approach to different market segments and improve overall alpha generation.

Hi  [KP26017](/hc/en-us/profiles/14992337006103-KP26017)  , are you possibly going off-topic from the original post's question? I feel like your answer is not very relevant to the purpose of the post.

### 评论 #20 (作者: NM98411, 时间: 1 year ago)

Explain the use of multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms in optimizing factor exposure timing, and how does Thompson sampling compare to Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) policies in balancing exploration and exploitation?

### 评论 #21 (作者: TT10055, 时间: 1 year ago)

This script you've put together is a great solution to handle the varying operator combinations from Genius.

---

### 评论 #22 (作者: VP87972, 时间: 1 year ago)

This function is streamlined and effectively organized for fetching operator data. Also, ensuring it outputs a dataframe and allows for CSV storage is particularly adept for ongoing use and analysis. It's a smart move to include error handling, which increases the robustness of your function.

---

### 评论 #23 (作者: NT34170, 时间: 1 year ago)

This script effectively integrates with the WorldQuant Brain API to fetch and handle operator data efficiently. It also ensures outputs are well structured for both immediate use and future reference by saving it as a CSV file.

---

### 评论 #24 (作者: TV53244, 时间: 1 year ago)

This is a solid approach to handle API requests and processing the data into a DataFrame. You’ve also handled possible exceptions which ensures your function is more robust.

---

### 评论 #25 (作者: PT27687, 时间: 1 year ago)

Your approach to dealing with the changing rules for operators is quite interesting! The function you've created seems really practical for users looking to manage their operators effectively. Just one question: how does the structure of the API response assist in organizing the operators in your DataFrame? It would be great to understand how you've tailored the output in the CSV file for better usability!

---

### 评论 #26 (作者: AN95618, 时间: 1 year ago)

It looks like there are some syntax errors in your provided code. Parts of the function like variable names (`ifresult.status_code...` should be `if result.status_code...

### 评论 #27 (作者: LH33235, 时间: 1 year ago)

It looks like you've written a helpful function for retrieving the list of operators based on user authentication.
