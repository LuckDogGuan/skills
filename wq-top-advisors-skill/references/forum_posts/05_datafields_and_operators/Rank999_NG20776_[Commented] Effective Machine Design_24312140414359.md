Hey everyone,

I wanted to share some insights into two approaches often discussed in the context of Brain API simulations: FIFO (First-In, First-Out) and multiplexing. If you've ever wondered how to maximize all 10 simulations slots, you're not alone. Let's dive into these concepts in a way that's accessible to all.

**What is FIFO?**

FIFO, standing for First-In, First-Out, is a straightforward method seen not only in simulation management but in various computing environments. Picture being in line at a coffee shop where service is based on arrival order. In BRAIN simulations, FIFO ensures the first task sent to the system gets processed and completed before moving on to subsequent tasks.

This process in Alpha simulations typically involves:

- Starting a BRAIN session.
- Sending simulation requests until hitting the max concurrent simulations.
- Waiting on the oldest simulation to complete before moving on.

However, FIFO can lead to inefficiencies, notably when dealing with complex simulations that take longer, potentially causing a backlog even when lighter tasks could proceed and free up slots.

**Multiplexing: A Smarter Approach**

Multiplexing improves upon FIFO by dynamically checking simulation statuses, similar to a DJ adjusting music in real-time for seamless flow. In BRAIN simulations, this means actively monitoring each simulation slot and distributing new Alpha request as soon as a slot frees up, thereby avoiding delays from heavier simulations.

This approach is detailed below:

- Starting a BRAIN session.
- Filling up to the max concurrent simulations.
- Looping through all simulations to quickly allocate new requests as slots become available.

**Conclusion**

Multiplexing is optimal in managing BRAIN simulations by ensuring efficient  use of all simulation slots, thanks to its real-time resource allocation. This approach prevents slowdowns from complex simulations, achieving a 100% utilization rate.

Happy simulating!

@ [TD17989](/hc/en-us/profiles/13680660215831-TD17989)  please create a ticket for the same or send an email to your research advisor.

[ND68030](/hc/en-us/profiles/9496734822295-ND68030)  you should keep a counter for keeping a note of the number of active simulations based on the prior requests sent by you. Sleep timer is not the most effective way

[TN48752](/hc/en-us/profiles/13714359745431-TN48752)  yes you can check finished simulations using the API

 [TT55495](/hc/en-us/profiles/13132630342807-TT55495)  you can possibly prioritize based on the expression complexity (number of operators, time-series or others, number of datafields) can be a decent proxy

This is a great explanation of the differences between FIFO and multiplexing in the context of Brain API simulations! 🚀

FIFO is a simple, fair approach but it can be slow when dealing with simulations of varying complexities. On the other hand, multiplexing takes it to the next level by ensuring that available slots are always used efficiently. It's similar to how a skilled DJ keeps the music flowing smoothly by adjusting in real-time—perfect for maximizing the performance of complex simulations.

This real-time resource management helps avoid idle time and maximizes the use of all available simulation slots. Definitely a game-changer for anyone running simulations in a high-demand environment like the Brain API. Thanks for sharing these insights!

Hello, I have a problem when simulating 10 multisim tabs in parallel (100 times sim in parallel), the api connection is often lost.

Hi, I would like to understand that the Waiting on the oldest simulation to complete before moving on. section means that the time sleep needs to be set to 1 minute or more, right?

Hi, I would like to ask how can I know when a submit is complete or timed out? Is there some kind of notification returned?

Great explanation of FIFO vs. multiplexing. I’m curious, when using multiplexing, how do you handle cases where a simulation might take significantly longer than others? Do you have a strategy to prioritize certain simulations or manage slot allocation dynamically based on task complexity?

Thank you for sharing these valuable insights into FIFO and multiplexing in the context of BRAIN simulations. How do you balance between using multiplexing and ensuring the accuracy of the simulations, especially when some models may need more time to generate precise results? Are there any best practices for managing simulations with highly complex models?

While FIFO is simple and easy to understand, multiplexing offers a more efficient approach for managing multiple simulations, especially when there is a mix of light and heavy tasks. By dynamically allocating simulation requests to available slots, multiplexing ensures a higher rate of resource utilization and helps to avoid delays caused by long-running simulations.

Great insights on FIFO vs. multiplexing in BRAIN simulations! Multiplexing really does seem like the smarter way to ensure efficient use of simulation slots, especially when dealing with a mix of light and heavy tasks. I’ve also found that monitoring simulation progress in real-time can really help avoid bottlenecks and improve overall throughput. Thanks for sharing this – it’s a valuable reminder for anyone looking to optimize their Alpha simulations! Keep up the good work! 🚀

Multiplexing, in the context you mentioned, is not truly "concurrent" but rather an efficient resource management strategy for simulations. It operates using real-time sharing or resource prioritization, allowing multiple simulations to appear as though they are running "concurrently," while in reality, resources are allocated alternately or based on priority.

If you use  **multiprocessing**  in Python to run a single simulation across multiple CPU cores, the performance will be higher for complex simulations requiring intensive computation, as all CPU resources are dedicated to a single task.

However, if you need to run multiple simulations simultaneously on the same system, multiplexing has the advantage of flexible resource allocation. It ensures that all simulations get their share of resources, preventing one simulation from monopolizing the system's resources.
