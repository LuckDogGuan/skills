As we know rank always returns a value between 0 and 1 , does it mean that using -rank(ts_delta(close,5)) mean that we would short the stocks whose difference is high with more than confidence and short the stocks with low difference with somewhat less confidence?

yes you are right.

I would like to ask that for example I have 2 alpha: -rank(returns) and rank(-returns), are their weighting methods different or the same? I hope to get more explanation about this case. Thank you very much.

In my understanding,  **-rank(returns)**  and  **rank(-returns)**  will give the same weights but in opposite directions.

**1. rank(-returns)**  directly ranks the negative returns, giving highest ranks to lowest returns.

**2. -rank(returns)**  first ranks the returns normally (highest returns get highest ranks), then negates these ranks, effectively achieving the same outcome as rank(-returns).

**Example** : returns: [5, 3, 1]    rank(-returns): [1, 2, 3]

-rank(returns): [-3, -2, -1] → [1, 2, 3] (after normalization)

Yes, you're on the right track! Let's break it down.

When you use  `-rank(ts_delta(close, 5))` , here's what happens:

1. **`ts_delta(close, 5)`** : This function calculates the difference (or change) in the stock's closing price over the last 5 time periods. So, for each stock, you get a value representing how much the price has changed compared to 5 periods ago.
2. **`rank()`** : The  `rank()`  function returns a value between 0 and 1, where stocks with the smallest value of  `ts_delta(close, 5)`  will have a rank close to 0, and stocks with the largest values of  `ts_delta(close, 5)`  will have a rank close to 1.
3. **`-rank(ts_delta(close, 5))`** : By negating the rank, you flip the relationship. Stocks with the highest positive change in price over the last 5 periods will now have a low (close to 0) rank, and stocks with the lowest (most negative) change in price will have a high (close to 1) rank.

### Interpretation in terms of shorting:

- Stocks that  **have the largest negative price changes**  (biggest price drops) will be ranked  **closer to 1**  and, when negated, will have the highest value, meaning you'd be  **more confident in shorting these stocks** .
- Stocks that  **have small or positive price changes**  will be ranked closer to 0 and, when negated, will have the smallest value, meaning you'd be  **less confident in shorting**  (or possibly more confident in going long if you reverse the signal).

### Conclusion:

Yes, using  `-rank(ts_delta(close, 5))`  essentially means you are more confident in shorting stocks whose price has dropped the most (since their rank is closer to 1 after negating), and less confident in shorting stocks with smaller price changes (since their rank is closer to 0 after negating). The confidence level is tied to the magnitude of the price change.

If you're trying to implement this strategy as a short signal, it makes sense: you'd be targeting stocks that have experienced the largest negative changes in price recently.

**-rank(ts_delta(close, 5)) explained:**

- `ts_delta(close, 5)` : Calculates the price change over the last 5 periods.
- `rank()` : Assigns values between 0 (smallest change) and 1 (largest change).
- Negating the rank flips it:
  - Stocks with the largest positive changes get ranks close to 0.
  - Stocks with the largest negative changes get ranks close to 1.

**Interpretation for shorting:**

- A higher rank (closer to 1) after negation indicates greater confidence in shorting stocks with the largest price drops.
- Lower ranks (closer to 0) indicate less confidence in shorting or potentially a long signal.

You're on the right track! Here's a clearer breakdown:

1. **ts_delta(close, 5):**  This calculates the price change over the last 5 periods for each stock, giving a measure of recent momentum.
2. **rank():**  Assigns a value between 0 and 1 based on the price changes. Stocks with the smallest price increases (or biggest drops) rank close to 0, while those with the largest increases rank close to 1.
3. **-rank(ts_delta(close, 5)):**  Negating the rank flips the order. Stocks with the largest drops rank closer to 1, signaling high confidence for shorting, while stocks with positive or small changes rank closer to 0, signaling low confidence for shorting (or even long potential).

### Interpretation:

This strategy emphasizes shorting stocks with significant recent price drops (high ranks after negation) and avoiding or considering long positions for those with small or positive changes (low ranks after negation). It's a method to prioritize short opportunities based on recent negative momentum.

The explanation confirms that  `-rank(ts_delta(close, 5))`  is a valid shorting signal. It ranks stocks by their 5-period price changes, with the largest drops having the highest confidence for shorting. This effectively targets stocks with significant recent negative momentum.

HI  [MK58212](/hc/en-us/profiles/24602065711639-MK58212)  I agree with your comments that -rank(ts_delta(close,5) is a sorting signal that ranks stocks by their previous period price movement

**Yeah, you guys are right. -rank(ts_delta(close, 5)) indeed acts as a shorting signal. It first figures out the price change in last 5 periods. Then rank() sorts them. Negating the rank makes stocks with big price drops get high ranks, meaning more confidence in shorting them. It's a useful way to focus on stocks with negative momentum for shorting.**

Yes, you're on the right track! The  `rank`  operator indeed returns a value between 0 and 1, and applying  `-rank(ts_delta(close, 5))`  can provide an insight into how to interpret stock movements and build your confidence in trading decisions.

`-rank(ts_delta(close, 5))`

- **`ts_delta(close, 5)`** : Computes the  **change in closing price**  over the past 5 periods. Positive values indicate gains, while negative values indicate losses.
- **`rank(...)`** : Assigns ranks to these changes, where the largest gains get the lowest ranks and the largest losses get the highest ranks.
- **Negation ( `-` )** : Inverts the ranking, so stocks with the largest  **price drops**  receive the  **highest confidence scores**  for shorting.

The signal effectively  **prioritizes shorting opportunities**  based on the magnitude of recent price drops. Stocks experiencing significant negative momentum are likely to continue their downward trend, making them attractive candidates for short positions.

### 评论 #15 (作者: KS69567, 时间: 1年前)

Yes, your explanation is spot on! Here's a detailed confirmation:

### Signal Breakdown:

- **Expression:**   `-rank(ts_delta(close, 5))`
  - **`ts_delta(close, 5)`** : Computes the  **change in closing price**  over the past 5 periods. Positive values indicate gains, while negative values indicate losses.
  - **`rank(...)`** : Assigns ranks to these changes, where the largest gains get the lowest ranks and the largest losses get the highest ranks.
  - **Negation ( `-` )** : Inverts the ranking, so stocks with the largest  **price drops**  receive the  **highest confidence scores**  for shorting.

### Interpretation:

- The signal effectively  **prioritizes shorting opportunities**  based on the magnitude of recent price drops. Stocks experiencing significant negative momentum are likely to continue their downward trend, making them attractive candidates for short positions.

### Why It Works:

1. **Momentum Continuation** :
   - Stocks with recent price declines often experience  **negative feedback loops**  due to factors like investor sentiment, stop-loss triggers, or ongoing negative fundamentals.
2. **Behavioral Biases** :
   - Traders may overreact to bad news, creating  **persistent downward pressure**  that this signal can exploit.

1. **Shorting Signal** :
   - Directly use  `-rank(ts_delta(close, 5))`  to identify and rank short candidates.
2. **Enhancements** :
   - Combine with additional signals to validate momentum:
   - **Volume spike**  filters to ensure the price drop is driven by significant trading activity.
   - Sentiment or news analysis to identify stocks with ongoing negative drivers.
   - Apply  **neutralization**  techniques to remove market-level or sector-level influences.
3. **Use Case in a Portfolio** :
   - Incorporate this signal into a  **market-neutral strategy** :
   - Go  **short**  on stocks with the highest (most negative) ranks.
   - Go  **long**  on stocks with the lowest (most positive) ranks (optional, based on your strategy).

This strategy aligns with  **momentum-based trading principles** , focusing on  **shorting underperforming stocks** . Here's a breakdown of the key elements and potential enhancements:

### Strategy Overview:

1. **Negation-Based Ranking** :
   - Recent price drops are ranked negatively, and stocks with significant drops receive  **higher ranks**  (better short candidates).
   - Stocks with small or positive changes are assigned  **lower ranks** , implying potential long candidates or avoidance.
2. **Prioritizing Shorts** :
   - The emphasis is on capitalizing on the continuation of  **negative momentum** , betting that stocks showing significant recent declines may continue to underperform.
