How to reduce production correlation from 0.9 to 0.6 without reducing sharpe or fitness much. If we should use grouping, how to use that...not able to understand

Although this might not answer your question exactly but try combining your alpha with other alphas (but it would affect sharpe) and also try to use those datafields which have high value score so that production correlation is low by default.

I think it's quite difficult, because the rate of creating an alpha version with a lower corr and a higher sharpe than the previous version is very difficult, because usually someone has submitted a high sharpe before. I think you should change the idea of ​​alpha, from there change the operator and data

You can try integrating it with other factors (e.g., risk factor, growth factor, etc.) to reduce production correlation.

You can simulate alpha in a lower liquidity universe (usually with higher sharpe) or simulate in markets that are similar to the one you are working in.

To reduce production correlation while maintaining Sharpe and fitness, apply grouping by clustering similar Alphas based on features, then select a subset with diverse signals. Use operators like "neutralization" or "scaling" to balance exposure. Ensure thorough backtesting to validate reduced correlation without compromising performance metrics like Sharpe ratio.

To reduce prod correlation,one can alter neutralization settings .Altering decay settings also helps.Use different fields to group the data using group rank , group neutralize operators

Some tips to reduce correlation for your alphas -

1) Use uncommon operators like vector_neut, vector_proj, regression _neut and regression proj while making your alphas.

2) Use group operators with custom neutralisations using different kinds of data. Eg. Group_coalesce, group_cartesian_product, etc. work extremely well.

By following these steps, you can lower the correlation without significantly impacting the Sharpe ratio or fitness of your alpha. Grouping is particularly useful when you have many assets in your universe, and it can help ensure that your alpha is spread across multiple, less correlated groups.

Try to use group operators you can see in operator browser. Also try to learn how to use "densify()" operator to control sparse group datafields. Please let us know if you have further questions :) thanks!
