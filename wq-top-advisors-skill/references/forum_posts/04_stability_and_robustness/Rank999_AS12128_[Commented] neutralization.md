Hi,

There is a table that recommends neutralization setting based on dataset category that you can use for your reference:  [https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/advanced-topics/neut-cons](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/advanced-topics/neut-cons)

A  **reversion idea**  typically works best under  **sector-neutral**  or  **industry-neutral**  settings. Here's why:

### **Why Sector/Industry Neutralization?**

1. **Reduces Bias from Broad Market Trends** :
   - By neutralizing sectors or industries, you remove the effect of large-scale market movements that might dominate price behaviors.
   - This allows your reversion strategy to focus on identifying relative mispricings within a specific group.
2. **Enhances Signal Specificity** :
   - Reversion strategies often rely on mean-reverting signals, which can be more pronounced within sectors or industries where similar stocks share common fundamentals or exposures.
3. **Balances Systematic Risks** :
   - Neutralization helps ensure that the strategy isn't overly exposed to macroeconomic or sector-wide shocks, which could drown out reversion signals.

### **Additional Considerations** :

- **Cross-sectional Neutralization** : Sometimes, neutralizing the entire market or broad indices (e.g., SP500) can also work, but it may dilute sector-specific opportunities.
- **Customization** : Depending on the dataset and strategy, experimenting with levels of neutralization—like style-neutral (neutralizing factors like size or value)—can refine performance.

#### Practical Tip:

Test your reversion idea across multiple neutralization settings to determine where it performs consistently well. Sector-neutral is often a good starting point for most reversion strategies.

Thank you for the detailed explanation—it’s very insightful! I see how sector or industry neutralization enhances signal precision and mitigates broad market biases, especially for reversion strategies.

I’ll explore testing different neutralization settings, starting with sector-neutral, to identify consistent performance. Do you have any additional tips for balancing cross-sectional neutralization and sector-specific opportunities?

Looking forward to your insights!

**Well, when it comes to balancing cross-sectional neutralization and sector-specific opportunities, here's a tip. You can first analyze the historical performance of your strategy under different neutralization scenarios. See how much the sector-specific signals contribute compared to the broader cross-sectional ones. Then, maybe try adjusting the weights gradually in your model based on that analysis. Also, keep an eye on the correlation between sectors and the overall market during different periods. That might help you find a good balance. Hope this helps!**

I think it depends on the situation you want to find the best neutralize. For example, if you want low turnover, you should choose neutral industry, if you want high sharpe, choose slow.

This is an excellent point.  **Neutralization**  is key to reducing the impact of confounding factors such as industry or market cap biases. By using more diverse neutralization techniques (e.g.,  **Fast, Slow** , or combinations of both), you can make sure that the alphas are truly independent of common systematic factors. The common practice of using only  **Industry**  and  **Market**  as neutralization factors can lead to overfitting and higher correlation, especially if these factors are highly correlated with other market movements. By adding more complexity and diversity to the neutralization process, the factors will tend to be more independent and robust.

Thank you for sharing this. It’s truly helpful to me since I’m currently only setting neutralization with Industry and Sub-Industry. Sometimes, I also wonder if there’s a table like the one you just mentioned.

By the way, do you happen to know a table that recommends operator settings based on dataset categories? I’m facing similar difficulties with this issue.

Neutralization simply means you optimize your future risk. So you can use industry neutralization or fast+slow, slow, factor, crowdwing, factor.

Hi, DK20528

"Great insights on why sector/industry neutralization is crucial for reversion strategies! By removing broad market trends and focusing on relative mispricings, you can enhance signal specificity and balance systematic risks."

Hi, DK20528

"The additional considerations on cross-sectional neutralization and customization are also valuable."

Hi, DK20528

"Thanks for sharing your expertise on sector/industry neutralization in reversion strategies! Your insights are super helpful in refining our approach to alpha generation."

"Thanks for the detailed explanation of neutralization. It's clear that neutralization is a crucial step in refining alpha strategies and minimizing risk exposure."

The distinction between 'Neutralization in Simulation Settings' and 'group_neutralize(x, group)' is particularly helpful. I appreciate the tips on choosing the right neutralization settings and stock groups for different universes. This will definitely help in optimizing alpha performance!"

By introducing additional neutralization techniques such as Fast and Slow, or even hybrid approaches, you're better able to account for a wider range of market influences. This increases the likelihood that the factors you're analyzing are capturing true alpha rather than just reacting to market-wide biases.

- Neutralizing entire markets or broad indices (like the SP500) can be a strategy to avoid general market movements and focus on alpha generated by individual securities.
- However, this can sometimes dilute the ability to capture sector-specific opportunities, which could potentially lead to suboptimal performance for strategies that benefit from sector-specific factors.

- Now, when you say that the  **output is the contribution of Y to the movement or variation of X** , it sounds like you're trying to measure the extent to which Y explains the variation or movement in X.
- This is typically captured through a  **projection**  or  **regression**  approach. If you project X onto Y, you get the component of X that is aligned with Y, which represents how much of  X is explained by Y. This can be seen as the  **contribution of Y to the variation of X**

Neutralization helps reduce the market’s impact on your Alpha. When the market turns unfavorable or becomes overly enthusiastic, these are unusual signals that long-term strategies generally aim to avoid.
Over the past year, Brain has developed a function that allows neutralization by Fast/Slow and Slow+Fast factors, ensuring that your Alpha isn’t affected by the aforementioned unusual signals.
A few months ago, neutralization of Crowding Factors was also introduced, and it has proven to be highly effective.
Additionally, you can also apply neutralization yourself using operators within your Alpha.

Hi  [NT63388](/hc/en-us/profiles/6348096761239-NT63388) , recommendation of operators on each dataset or dataset categories is not provided officially, because it can lead a concentration of alpha expression and damage diversity of alphas. However, about this kind of problem you can get help from your BRAIN research advisor! Your advisor might happily suggest you the operators and datasets for your better research.
