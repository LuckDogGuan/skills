This article explains how I refined a volatility-based strategy to create a  **submittable alpha**  using  **required**  transformations.

#### Step 1: Initial Raw Expression

The original expression calculated the difference between call and put volatilities:
Region: USA
Universe: TOP3000

```
opt4_122_call_vola_delta45 - opt4_122_put_vola_delta45
```

However, the  **Sub-universe Sharpe ratio**  was 0.75, below the required cutoff of 1.03, making the signal unstable.

#### Step 2: Applying  **tanh**

To reduce the impact of extreme values and  **remove outliers** , I applied the  **tanh**  function. This transformed the volatility difference into a bounded range, smoothing out large fluctuations:

```
pasteurize(tanh(opt4_122_call_vola_delta45 - opt4_122_put_vola_delta45)
```

This improved the Sharpe ratio to 0.78 but still fell short of the required threshold.

#### Step 3: Volatility Normalization

Next, I normalized the volatility difference by dividing by  **opt4_call_vola_122d** , which helped adjust the difference in the context of overall volatility:

```
idea = pasteurize(tanh((opt4_122_call_vola_delta45 - opt4_122_put_vola_delta45) / opt4_call_vola_122d))
```

This further improved performance but wasn't enough on its own.

#### Step 4: Ranking and Grouping Open Interest

I then ranked the total open interest to capture market sentiment, grouping it into buckets (0 to 1 in 0.05 steps).
Finally, I applied the  **zscore**  transformation to standardize the grouped data, improving stability and making the signal more robust:

This produced a  **submittable alpha** .

### Key Considerations and Future Improvements

1. **High Turnover** : As its a options dataset it usually has higher turnover, so use decay or use new  turnover operators to reduce turnover.
2. **Delta Experimentation** : We can still experiment with different delta values for better performance.
3. **Automation** : Automate to refine the alpha and reduce manual adjustments.
4. **Fitness vs. Robustness** : The final signal is more robust, even with slightly lower fitness compared to the initial expression.

Thanks for your idea. I think there should be operators that intervene in data options to reduce correlation, because this idea is quite popular so it will lead to high correlation.

The  **Volatility Difference Strategy**  is a trading strategy based on the difference in volatility between two assets or a benchmark and a specific asset. The idea behind this strategy is that when one asset’s volatility deviates from the other or from its own historical volatility, it may indicate a potential trading opportunity. This strategy is often used in  **pairs trading**  or in  **market-neutral strategies** .

### Key Concepts:

1. **Volatility** : A measure of the dispersion of returns for a given asset. It is often calculated using the standard deviation of returns over a specified period.
2. **Volatility Difference** : The difference in volatility between two assets or between an asset and a benchmark. For example, if Asset A has higher volatility than Asset B, it might signal a potential trading opportunity, assuming mean reversion or a volatility spike.
3. **Mean Reversion** : This is a common assumption in volatility difference strategies, where traders expect that volatility differences will revert to a long-term mean over time.

The  **Volatility Difference Strategy**  can be an effective approach to generating alpha, particularly in market-neutral setups or when trading pairs of assets. By focusing on the volatility dynamics between assets, the strategy seeks to capitalize on mean reversion or volatility convergence, while managing risk through proper position sizing and threshold management.

For more robust implementations, additional risk management techniques, such as stop-loss orders, portfolio diversification, and regular optimization of the strategy, can further improve its reliability.

According to the pnl results, I think you should use alpha with neutralize risk factor, then continue to optimize alpha, because the drawdown in neutralize usually seems quite high, which will affect os performance.

Hi MA97359,

Thank you for sharing this detailed and methodical approach to refining a volatility-based strategy! Your step-by-step explanation of improvements—from handling outliers with  `tanh`  to normalizing volatility and ranking open interest—is highly insightful and a great learning resource for creating robust alphas.

### Key Highlights I Found Interesting:

1. **Use of  `tanh`** : A smart choice for mitigating the impact of outliers. It’s a practical operator for stabilizing signals and enhancing robustness.
2. **Normalization** : Dividing by  `opt4_call_vola_122d`  adds context to the raw differences, effectively adjusting for the overall volatility landscape.
3. **Open Interest Grouping** : This is an innovative touch to capture market sentiment dynamics, and using  `zscore`  further improves signal standardization.

Implementing the  **Volatility Difference Strategy**  in alpha generation involves exploiting differences in volatility between assets, asset classes, or market conditions to create a systematic trading approach. This strategy can be used to identify opportunities in relative value trading, hedging, or directional positioning.The  **Volatility Difference Strategy**  is based on the premise that differences in volatility between related instruments or regimes can be indicative of mispricing, arbitrage opportunities, or risk-adjusted return potential.

Reduce High Turnover: Use decay functions and turnover-specific operators to limit unnecessary trades and focus on the most recent and relevant data.

Experiment with Delta: Test and optimize delta values to enhance performance, adjusting for market conditions.

Automate the Process: Automate the refinement of your alpha model and parameter tuning to continuously optimize the strategy.

Prioritize Robustness: Focus on robustness in your final signal, even if it means slightly lower backtest performance, to ensure the strategy performs well in diverse market conditions.

The article offered practical steps for refining a volatility-based strategy, focusing on transforming data to meet submission criteria. The progression from a raw volatility difference expression to the use of tanh for outlier reduction and normalization shows a solid understanding of how to fine-tune alphas for stability. The application of ranking and grouping open interest, followed by z-scoring, was a good move to standardize the data and enhance robustness. However, the article also highlighted areas for improvement, such as managing turnover and experimenting with different delta values, which could refine the strategy further. The approach of using various operators like pasteurize and zscore was effective in smoothing and stabilizing the signal, making it submittable. The emphasis on automating the process and balancing fitness and robustness shows an understanding of real-world constraints in quantitative finance. Overall, this article provides a clear and methodical approach to refining alpha strategies, which is useful for improving signal quality in the competitive landscape.

Although the strategy has improved the stability of the signal, maintaining the ability to respond flexibly to macro events or unexpected news is crucial. Additionally, periodically re-evaluating the data over time and using cross-validation methods helps ensure that the signal is not overfitted and remains effective under changing market conditions.
