## 帖子正文

The relationship between input's current and past values is a temporal (⏳) dependence structure. This dependence makes prediction, filtering and control possible.

This article elaborates on modeling dependence through autocorrelation, autocovariance functions and autoregressive processes. Definitions and brief theoretical background are provided 📖.

These concepts can be used for creating alphas given the available operators.

**Briefly About Stochastic Processes**

A stochastic process is a sequence of random variables (🎲) indexed by time. A time series is an observed sequence of a stochastic process.

A few examples of stochastic processes

- White noise: A random signal whose values at different times have no correlation (are orthogonal) and behave statistically same at every time step, so the past values give no information about the future (pure white noise: No information → No predictability → No alpha)
- Random walk: A process that evolves step by step by adding a new random change to its current value, so each position is the accumulation of all past random steps
- Autoregressive(AR), Moving Average(MA), Autoregressive Moving Average(ARMA) processes: linear stochastic processes widely used in econometrics
- Brownian motion: a continuous-time stochastic process with independent Gaussian increments
- Poisson process: a counting process modeling the random occurrence of events over time ⏱️

**Autocorrelation Function**

The autocorrelation function measures the linear dependence between values of a stochastic process at different time instants, normalized by variance.

We can start with the following alpha structure

```
ts_corr(x, ts_delay(x,tau), days) # tau = lag 
```

**Autocovariance Function**

The autocovariance function measures how strongly a stochastic process~(or time series) relates to a time-shifted version of itself.

We can start with the following alpha structure

```
 ts_covariance (x , ts_delay (x , tau ) , days ) # tau = lag
```

**Autoregressive Processes 🔄**

An autoregressive process models time series as a linear combination of its past values and an innovation term. It captures temporal dependence with finite memory.

This is a great overview of fundamental time series concepts! I especially appreciate the connection you draw to alpha creation with the `ts_corr` example – it really highlights how these theoretical tools can be directly translated into actionable strategies.

This is a fantastic breakdown of the foundational concepts behind time series dependencies! I particularly appreciate the explicit link to alpha development with the `ts_corr` example – that's exactly how these abstract ideas translate into practical strategies. A thought that comes to mind is how the choice of the `days` parameter in `ts_corr` can significantly impact the detected autocorrelation, especially in noisy or regime-switching series. Have you found specific methods or heuristics that work well for selecting an appropriate lookback window in practice?

This is a great breakdown of fundamental concepts for understanding temporal dependencies. I particularly like the inclusion of the `ts_corr` alpha structure as a practical application.

This is a great overview of fundamental concepts for time series analysis! I've often found that directly implementing `ts_corr(x, ts_delay(x,tau), days)` can be a good starting point for alpha generation. Have you explored how the choice of `days` (the lookback period for the correlation) impacts the stationarity assumptions for the AR models you might build on top of these relationships? It would be interesting to see examples of how these functions are practically used to build actual alpha factors.

### 评论 #18 (作者: NL65170, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a fantastic overview of fundamental time series concepts! The connection between autocorrelation and the `ts_corr` operator is particularly insightful for alpha development. I'm curious, AS75199, have you found specific practical applications of modeling autocovariance directly in alpha construction beyond what autocorrelation captures, perhaps in cases where the *magnitude* of the deviation matters more than just the correlation?

### 评论 #19 (作者: AS75199, 时间: 4个月前)

[NL65170](/hc/en-us/profiles/25728581783319-NL65170)  I've found autocovariance useful for comparing two data fields, for instance by subtracting the two autocovariance functions. Magnitude of the deviation can be used as a condition with some threshold, as an alpha deviation itself has been more effective for me.
