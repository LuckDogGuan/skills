**Tips for getting started with  [Analyst](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets?category=analyst)  Datasets:**

- Analyst datasets have well-structured data fields that can be considered as analysts’ sentiment scores for various fundamental ratios. Common time series and cross-sectional operations such as ts_rank, zscore, or rank can be applied to these fields.
- Comparing analyst scores on the same fundamental ratio from two different time periods can provide useful signals. For this purpose, you can use the ts_delta operator.
- General guidance for using the group operators on model data fields includes trying the following: group_rank, group_neutralize, group_normalize, and group_zscore.
- Since some analyst datasets indirectly seeks to predict returns, you can assess their potential predictive power by taking the correlation of data fields with returns/close prices.
- Analyst datasets can be large and serve as signals that seeks to predict potential returns. Therefore, ts_delta can be useful for this dataset. For instance, changes in EPS can detect earning surprises.
  - When calculating differences, be cautious of stock-split events when dealing with this kind of dataset.
- To reduce exposure to groups, group_neutralize can be helpful.
  - Country and sector neutralizations generally work well, though we recommend trying other groups as well.

**Example Alpha Ideas:**

- Check differences between estimates of long-term versus short-term horizons, and set reversal or momentum signals based on which time horizon is higher. The same idea can apply to comparisons between estimates and actuals.
- Assign Alphas based directly on the estimates, or delta(estimates), or correlation(estimates, returns on the same horizon).
- Assign Alphas in the event of high dispersion among estimates or estimates of different time horizons.

**Recommended Datasets:**

Great overview on Analyst Datasets! The tips on using common time series operations like  **ts_rank** ,  **zscore** , and  **ts_delta**  are really helpful, especially for gauging sentiment from analysts’ scores. I particularly like the idea of comparing estimates from different time horizons to create reversal or momentum signals.

I also find the suggestion of using  **group_neutralize**  for exposure management quite useful, especially in avoiding biases due to sector or country effects.

Looking forward to applying these ideas, and I’ll definitely keep an eye on the recommended datasets for further exploration.

Thanks for sharing this!

This is a great overview of how to start with Analyst Datasets! The idea of comparing analyst scores over time and using operators like  `ts_delta`  to track changes in estimates is particularly insightful. It’s interesting to consider how differences in time horizons between estimates can create reversal or momentum signals.

One thing I’d like to explore more is how to effectively handle high dispersion among analyst estimates. Could the  `group_neutralize`  operator help smooth out extremes in analyst sentiment, or are there other techniques you’d recommend for this kind of dataset?

Hi,
Analyst datasets offer structured fields that represent analysts’ sentiments or predictions for fundamental ratios. These datasets can be powerful for generating trading signals.

- **Time-Series Analysis** : Use tools like  `ts_rank` ,  `zscore` , or  `rank`  to analyze patterns. Compare scores over time with  `ts_delta`  to detect changes, such as earning surprises from EPS adjustments.
- **Group Operations** : Techniques like  `group_rank` ,  `group_neutralize` , and  `group_zscore`  can help refine signals by adjusting for industry or sector influences.
- **Correlation Checks** : Assess how well analyst predictions align with actual returns by examining the correlation of dataset fields with stock prices.
- **Split Adjustments** : Be mindful of stock-split events when calculating differences, as they can distort results.

**Alpha Ideas** :

- Compare short- and long-term estimates to generate momentum or reversal signals.
- Use high dispersion in estimates as an indicator of potential opportunities.
- Apply neutralization by country or sector to reduce bias and improve signal reliability.

The post describes several techniques for leveraging analyst datasets in financial analysis and alpha generation. How would you design a comprehensive alpha strategy that combines multiple approaches mentioned in the post - specifically utilizing estimate dispersions, time horizon comparisons, and group neutralization? Include considerations for handling stock splits, managing country/sector exposures, and evaluating the strategy's predictive power through return correlations. Additionally, explain how you would implement the ts_delta operator to detect earnings surprises while accounting for data quality issues.

This post provides great insights into how to leverage analyst datasets for generating alpha signals. The suggestion to use operators like  `ts_delta`  to compare analyst scores from different time periods is particularly valuable for identifying potential market movements. I also like the emphasis on using group operators like  `group_rank`  and  `group_neutralize`  to manage sector and country exposures, which can help in constructing more balanced and robust strategies.

**Analyst datasets**  contain structured fields that serve as sentiment scores for various fundamental ratios. Common operations like  **ts_rank** ,  **zscore** , or  **rank**  can be applied to these fields, while  **ts_delta**  is useful for comparing analyst scores across time periods to uncover signals, such as detecting earnings surprises through changes in EPS.

To refine signals and reduce bias, techniques like  **group_rank** ,  **group_neutralize** ,  **group_normalize** , and  **group_zscore**  are recommended. For predictive analysis, the correlation of analyst data fields with returns or closing prices can help assess their effectiveness. Caution is advised when handling stock-split events, as they can distort difference calculations.

Country and sector neutralization work well to reduce group exposures, but experimenting with other groupings may also yield valuable insights. Analyst datasets are often large and aimed at predicting potential returns, making them a robust tool for investment strategies.

**Analyst datasets** provide structured, quantitative insights through sentiment scores for fundamental ratios, differing from the real-time, sentiment-driven nature of social media data and the text-based trend extraction of NLP data. Unlike equity flow, which tracks capital movements, analyst datasets focus on predicting returns using numerical metrics like EPS changes or correlation with prices. They complement company relationship datasets by offering a predictive layer rather than analyzing structural interactions. Together, these datasets provide a multi-faceted view of market trends and potential investment opportunities.

Thank you to the contributors for providing such detailed guidance to the community!

This study highlights how investor learning about earnings signals has been incomplete. While past research shows declining return predictability from traditional bottom-line earnings, this paper reveals that alternative profitability signals—less susceptible to signal weakening—retain more predictive power. Modified earnings measures show 30–64% less return erosion over time, especially in contexts with noisy earnings (e.g., special items, Q4). This suggests that markets still underreact to certain earnings components despite apparent learning. The robustness across various controls and partitions underscores the need for improved signal extraction from financial statements in alpha research. A must-read for quant and fundamental investors alike.

I’m encountering a JSONDecodeError when calling  `get_simulation_result_json` . The request to  `https://api.worldquantbrain.com/alphas/{alpha_id}`  returns an empty response or invalid JSON, resulting in  `Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)` . This happens inside a multiprocessing pool while using  `simulate_alpha_list_multi` . What are the common causes of this issue—such as session timeouts, server-side failures, or invalid alpha IDs—and how should I handle or debug it to ensure robustness?
