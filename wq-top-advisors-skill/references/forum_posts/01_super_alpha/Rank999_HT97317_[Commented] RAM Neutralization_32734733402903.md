RAM removes an alpha’s exposure to price-based factors, typically 5-day Mean Reversion and 12-month Momentum.
After neutralization, the alpha becomes less sensitive to short-term reversal and mid-term momentum effects, reducing risks like price noise, crowded trades, and momentum decay.
This helps improve Sharpe stability, reduce drawdowns, and narrow the gap between backtest and live results.
If your alphas don't rely on short-term reversion or medium-term momentum, it might be worth trying.

Note: in code, set  `'neutralization': "REVERSION_AND_MOMENTUM"` .

In  **RAM Neutralization** , two key factors are neutralized:

1. **Momentum Factor** :
   Captures  **price trends**  — stocks going up tend to keep going up, and vice versa. Neutralizing this reduces exposure to trend-following behaviors, especially useful during market reversals.
2. **Reversion Factor**  (Short-Term Mean Reversion):
   Captures  **short-term price reversals**  — stocks that have moved sharply may revert. Neutralizing this helps avoid noise or excessive turnover from quick price swings.

Both are derived from  **price-based signals** . RAM helps make your alpha more robust by reducing unintended exposure to these common market effects.

1. The reversion factor refers to the mean reversion phenomenon, where stocks that have recently experienced excessive declines or gains tend to rebound or correct in the short term.

2. The momentum factor means that stocks showing an upward trend continue to rise by following the trend—for example, stocks that keep climbing often stay above their 5-day or 10-day moving averages as they move higher.

The simplest way is to try running RAM neutralization on old Alphas that couldn’t be submitted due to Correlation issues.

RAM neutralization helps diversify your submitted dataset, thereby improving Weight and VF.

Reversion captures price corrections, while Momentum tracks trend persistence. Both are key in RAM neutralization to balance opposing market forces.

### 评论 #7 (作者: DJ40095, 时间: 1年前)

In RAM (Reversion and Momentum) Neutralization, two key factors are addressed:

- **Reversion Factor**  captures short-term mean reversion, where recently underperforming stocks tend to rebound and outperform in the near future (typically within 5 days).
- **Momentum Factor**  captures trend-following behavior, where stocks that have performed well over the past 12 months tend to continue performing well, and vice versa for underperformers.

**RAM Neutralization**  adjusts Alpha signals to reduce exposure to these price-driven effects, helping to minimize risk from crowded trades and market overreactions, ultimately improving performance and robustness of investment strategies.

Reversion and Momentum are style factors used in RAM (Reversion and Momentum) neutralization on the Genius platform to ensure diversity in alpha behavior. The Reversion factor captures mean-reverting signals—alphas that expect prices to return to their historical average—while the Momentum factor reflects trend-following behavior, where recent winners are expected to keep performing well. Neutralizing against these factors helps avoid overconcentration in a single style, promoting a more balanced and robust alpha portfolio.

Exactly! Reversion reflects price correction behavior, and Momentum captures trend continuation. In RAM neutralization, balancing these two opposing forces ensures your alpha portfolio isn't overly biased toward one style, promoting stability and diversification across different market regimes.

### 评论 #11 (作者: AK40989, 时间: 1年前)

Reversion and Momentum are two style factors that capture opposing short and long term price behaviors mean reversion over a 5-day window and trend persistence over 12 months, respectively. RAM Neutralization reduces exposure to these factors, helping alphas avoid hidden biases toward recent price movements. This not only improves robustness during market drawdowns but also sharpens signal quality by eliminating unintended price dependencies.

Reversion measures a stock's tendency to return to its mean, while Momentum reflects price trends. In RAM neutralization, both are adjusted to remove style bias. This ensures your alpha's performance isn't driven by common strategies, making it more unique and potentially more valuable for selection in Power Pool or combinations.

Reversion and Momentum are style factors used in RAM neutralization on Genius to ensure diverse alpha behavior. Reversion captures mean-reverting signals, while Momentum tracks trend-following ones. Neutralizing them prevents style overconcentration, leading to a more balanced alpha portfolio.

RAM neutralization is used to reduce unwanted exposure to two key price-driven risk factors:  **Reversion**  and  **Momentum** .

The  **Reversion Factor**  reflects short-term mean-reverting behavior, where underperforming stocks bounce back and outperforming stocks pull back. An example would be  `-ts_delta(close, 1)` . Alphas exposed to this may become unstable during trending markets.

The  **Momentum Factor**  captures trend-following behavior — stocks that rise continue rising. Signals like  `ts_delta(close, 20)`  or correlation-based momentum patterns often represent this. While potentially profitable, momentum exposure can be risky during reversals, especially in crowded trades.

RAM neutralization helps remove unintended influences from these behaviors, ensuring that your alpha isn’t just reflecting market noise or widely used strategies. It improves stability, reduces drawdowns, lowers turnover, and enhances the Sharpe ratio. Even when working with fundamentals (like  `eps/close` ), price still has influence — so RAM is often a smart choice to create more robust, distinctive, and cost-efficient alphas.

Oh man, I just found out about the 2X multiplier for the RAM Neutralization Theme today, June 19th! With it ending on the 22nd, I've basically missed most of it. Such a shame I didn't see this sooner, haha!

### 评论 #18 (作者: NQ13558, 时间: 1年前)

Same question. Also, I am wondering if any regions can benefit from the RAM neutralization. I have just tried ASI and USA, and it seems like the alpha-making process is way too complicated. Please give me some suggestion :(

### 评论 #19 (作者: NP85445, 时间: 1年前)

The key reason to use RAM neutralization is to prove your alpha has its own unique edge. A huge number of signals are really just hidden bets on either momentum or mean-reversion. By neutralizing, you're stripping out those common, well-known style effects to see if there's any real predictive power left in your core idea.

In RAM (Reversion and Momentum) neutralization, the  **Reversion**  and  **Momentum**  factors represent two opposite short-term price behaviors:

1. **Reversion Factor** :
   - Captures the tendency of stocks to  **reverse recent price moves** .
   - A stock that recently dropped might bounce back (mean-reverting), and one that surged might decline.
   - Typically based on  **short-term returns**  (e.g., 1–5 days).
2. **Momentum Factor** :
   - Captures the tendency of stocks to  **continue moving in the same direction** .
   - A stock that’s been rising often keeps rising; one that’s falling may keep falling.
   - Usually based on  **medium-term returns**  (e.g., 20–60 days).

**RAM neutralization**  involves adjusting or removing these effects from an alpha to avoid overreliance on volatile short-term price behaviors, leading to more stable and robust signals.

Reversion measures mean-reverting behavior; Momentum captures trend-following. RAM neutralization removes style bias from both, helping ensure alpha uniqueness a key factor for Power Pool inclusion and effective combination.

RAM (Reversion and Momentum) neutralization removes biases from short- and medium-term price movements. Reversion captures mean-reverting behavior over 1–5 days, while Momentum reflects trend persistence over 20–60 days. Neutralizing these factors helps reduce volatility and overfitting, leading to more stable, robust alphas less reliant on noisy price patterns.

**Reversion and Momentum Neutralization (RAM):** 
RAM reduces an alpha’s sensitivity to short-term price reversals and ongoing price trends. By removing these common market effects, it helps avoid noise, crowded trades, and unstable performance. This makes the alpha more robust and consistent across different market conditions.

**Reversion and Momentum Factors in RAM Neutralization**

In quantitative finance, RAM neutralization refers to removing the influence of  **Reversion** ,  **Acceleration** , and  **Momentum**  from trading signals or portfolios to isolate true alpha. Two key components— **Reversion**  and  **Momentum** —often represent opposing market behaviors.

**# Reversion**  (or mean reversion) assumes that asset prices tend to return to their historical average. It’s a contrarian approach: buy underperformers expecting a rebound, and sell outperformers anticipating a pullback. Indicators like Bollinger Bands and RSI help identify reversion opportunities.

**# Momentum** , by contrast, follows the trend. Assets that have recently performed well are expected to continue doing so. Momentum strategies rely on indicators like moving averages and price strength to ride persistent trends.

# In RAM neutralization, these factors are statistically identified and stripped from signals or portfolios using regression or optimization. This helps avoid unintended exposure to behavioral biases and market regimes, making strategies more robust and focused on non-RAM sources of return.

By neutralizing Reversion and Momentum, quants can build cleaner, factor-independent models that perform consistently across different market conditions. It’s a powerful tool for refining signal quality and improving risk-adjusted performance.
