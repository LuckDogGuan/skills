## **Tests of Statistical Hypotheses**

Hello. The topic is statistical hypothesis testing. The agenda prepared is as follows.

### Agenda

1. Concepts of statistical hypothesis testing
2. Types of hypotheses
3. Procedures for hypothesis testing
4. Major statistical testing methods

## **1. Concept of statistical hypothesis testing**

Statistical hypothesis testing is a method of evaluating the validity of a hypothesis based on data. It is a key tool for using sample data to confirm whether a hypothesis about a population is correct or to test differences between different groups.

Hypothesis testing is mainly used in the following situations:

- Test the mean, proportion, or variance of a specific population
- Compare the differences between two groups.
- Examine the relationship between variables.

## **2. Types of Hypotheses**

#### **(1) Null Hypothesis (H₀)**

- Indicates a basic assumption or current state.
- Takes the form "no difference" or "no effect."
- Example: The means of the two groups are the same.

#### **(2) Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**

- The opposite hypothesis to the Null Hypothesis.
- It has the form "There is a difference" or "There is an effect."
- Example: The means of the two groups are different.

## **3. Hypothesis testing procedure**

#### **(1) Hypothesis setting**

- Define H₀ and H₁.

#### **(2) Setting the Significance Level (α)**

- The probability of allowing an error, usually 0.05 (5%), is used.
- If α = 0.05, it means that there is a 5% chance of rejecting the wrong H₀.

#### **(3) Calculating test statistics**

- Calculate statistics (T-statistic, Z-statistic, etc.) from data.

#### **(4) Calculating the P-value**

- The probability that the observed result would occur under H₀.
- If P-value < α, reject H₀.

#### **(5) Drawing a conclusion.**

- Evaluate the validity of the hypothesis by rejecting or failing to reject H₀.

## **4. Major statistical testing methods**

#### **(1) T-Test**

The T-test is a statistical test used to compare differences between means.

**1. One-Sample T-Test**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import ttest_1sampdata = [177, 179, 181, 178, 182]t_stat, p_value = ttest_1samp(data, 180)
```

**2. Independent Two-Sample T-Test**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import ttest_indgroup1 = [177, 179, 181, 178, 182]group2 = [170, 172, 174, 171, 173]t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(group1, group2)
```

**3. Paired T-Test**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import ttest_relbefore = [177, 179, 181, 178, 182]after = [175, 177, 179, 176, 180]t_stat, p_value = ttest_rel(before, after)
```

#### **(2) ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**

ANOVA is used to test the difference in means among three or more groups.

**1. One-Way ANOVA**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import f_onewaygroup1 = [177, 179, 181, 178, 182]group2 = [170, 172, 174, 171, 173]group3 = [165, 167, 169, 166, 168]f_stat, p_value = f_oneway(group1, group2, group3)
```

**2. Two-Way ANOVA**

#### **(3) Chi-Square Test**

The Chi-Square Test compares observed frequencies with expected frequencies in categorical data.

**1. Test of independence.**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import chi2_contingencydata = [[10, 20], [20, 40]]chi2, p_value, _, _ = chi2_contingency(data)
```

**2. Goodness-of-fit test.**

#### **(4) Correlation Test**

The Correlation Test evaluates the linear relationship between two variables.

**1. Pearson Correlation**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import pearsonrx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]corr, p_value = pearsonr(x, y)
```

**2. Spearman Correlation**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import spearmanrcorr, p_value = spearmanr(x, y)
```

**3. Kendall Correlation**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import kendalltaucorr, p_value = kendalltau(x, y)
```

Statistical hypothesis testing plays a crucial role in data analysis, providing tools to evaluate the validity of a hypothesis based on data. It is essential to select an appropriate testing method and draw reliable conclusions based on the significance level and P-value. By leveraging these testing methods, you can produce more robust and meaningful analytical results!

Statistical hypothesis testing is a critical method used in data analysis to evaluate hypotheses based on sample data. It is designed to determine whether there is enough evidence to support a claim or to test differences between groups. There are two primary hypotheses: the Null Hypothesis (H₀), which suggests no effect or difference, and the Alternative Hypothesis (H₁), which proposes that there is an effect or difference. The procedure involves defining the hypotheses, setting a significance level (α), calculating test statistics, determining the P-value, and then drawing conclusions about the validity of H₀. Common methods include the T-test, ANOVA, Chi-Square Test, and correlation tests, each of which is suited for specific types of data and research questions. These methods enable researchers to make data-driven decisions and draw meaningful conclusions.

Thank you for sharing. In hypothesis testing, test misuse is an important factor. This can occur when the chosen test is not appropriate for the nature of the data or the research hypothesis. For example, using a t-test for data that is not normally distributed or lacks homogeneity of variances can lead to misleading results.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):**  This is the assumption that there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship in the population. It represents the  **status quo**  or  **baseline assumption** .
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha):**  This is the hypothesis that contradicts the null hypothesis. It represents a claim that there is an effect, a difference, or a relationship.
