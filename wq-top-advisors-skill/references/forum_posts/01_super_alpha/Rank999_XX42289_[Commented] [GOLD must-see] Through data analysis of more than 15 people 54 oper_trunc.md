## 帖子正文

Through the data analysis of the operators data of more than 15 GOLD and above consultants, we have obtained the following 54 operators that must be used, which can be used as a basis for modifying the code. Share it with everyone for free! Thank you to everyone in the project team for their dedication!

This post offers an impressive and practical list of 54 must-have operators, curated through data analysis of over 15 GOLD-level consultants. Sharing the code to extract operators and save them as a CSV is a fantastic bonus for others to easily replicate and customize.

Operators like  `ts_zscore` ,  `rank` , and  `group_neutralize`  are indeed essential for advanced alpha development, while fundamental ones like  `add` ,  `multiply` , and  `divide`  ensure a solid base for expressions. This list is a great resource for streamlining workflows and boosting productivity in quantitative research. Thanks to the project team for sharing such valuable insights!

### 评论 #7 (作者: QG16026, 时间: 1年前)

Thank you so much for sharing this incredibly valuable list of 54 must-have operators derived from the analysis of gold-level consultants. This resource is a game-changer for anyone working on enhancing their alpha strategies.

### 评论 #8 (作者: AK98027, 时间: 1年前)

From what you've mentioned, it sounds like this is focused on technical analysis and alpha factor development. The operators you highlighted -  `ts_zscore`  (time series z-score normalization),  `rank` , and  `group_neutralize`  - are indeed common in cross-sectional analysis and risk-adjusted returns calculation. Would you like to explore any specific aspects of these operators or discuss how they're typically implemented in alpha factor development?

Thank you for sharing. An important factor to consider is computational performance. Operations like  `ts_zscore`  or  `multi_regression`  can be time and resource intensive, especially when working with long time-series data or large datasets. Therefore, optimizing these operators, such as by using batch processing or multi-threading techniques, will help improve the speed and efficiency of the trading model.

Thank you for sharing such an excellent post! It truly highlights the power of automation through APIs in efficiently retrieving valuable information about available operators. A remarkable demonstration of how technology simplifies complex tasks and boosts productivity!

Thanks for sharing. 
Actually, the Platform has already released this functionality in a visual way. Consultants can go to Learn > Operators, and now under each Operator there is a small note, with two types: "base" and "genius". And this is official information. 
What you are trying to list is of the "base" type that any consultant can use.

For example, QuantLib, Pandas, or any specific API you’re using will have documentation listing available data fields. If you’re using a specific library, I'd suggest checking its official documentation for details on available statistics fields and methods.

Thanks for your sharing about the operators that GOLD level can use. 
Are there lists of Operators for the Expert and Master levels? 
I want to develop flexible algorithms for the future, in case my Genius level might change.

Explain the use of continuous-time stochastic portfolio theory in characterizing arbitrage opportunities in relative performance portfolios, and how does it relate to classical Kelly criterion-based betting strategies?

### 评论 #16 (作者: PT27687, 时间: 1年前)

It's impressive that you've compiled such a comprehensive list of operators from the input of several experienced consultants. This collaborative effort not only enhances our coding capabilities but also fosters a sense of community among data analysts. How did you determine which operators were the most essential? It would be interesting to hear more about your selection process!

This list of 54 essential operators is a fantastic resource for anyone looking to enhance their coding capabilities on the platform. It’s interesting to see how collective insights from experienced consultants can lead to such a comprehensive toolkit. Given the variety of operators listed, which ones do you think are the most underutilized, and how could they potentially unlock new strategies for data analysis?

Could you provide some concrete examples of multi_regression? Documentation not clear.

### 评论 #20 (作者: LR13671, 时间: 1年前)

These operators include fundamental mathematical tools like  `add` ,  `multiply` , and  `divide` , as well as advanced time series functions such as  `ts_zscore` ,  `ts_rank` ,  `multi_regression` , and  `group_neutralize` . These are widely used for signal normalization, feature transformation, and statistical robustness in alpha construction.
