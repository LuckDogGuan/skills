The Combined Alpha Performance Score is a critical metric for reaching higher tiers in the BRAIN Genius Program. It measures how effectively your submitted Alphas work together, balancing individual performance and the synergy between them. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the factors influencing this score and strategies to improve it.

### **1. What Influences Combined Alpha Performance?**


> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> The combined Sharpe (Sc) of your Alphas is determined by three key factors:
> Average Sharpe (Sa): Higher Sharpe ratios for individual Alphas lead to a stronger combined
> SCOre
> Number of Alphas (n): Increasing the number of Alphas boosts performance, especially
> When they are uncorrelated。
> Correlation (p): Lower correlation between Alphas enhances diversification, improving the
> combined Sharpe.
> The combined Sharpe can be approximated by:
> Sa
> Sc
> 1 +
> 阮p
 ​​

### **2. Effects of Key Parameters**

### **3. Strategies to Boost Combined Alpha Performance**

#### **1. Focus on Low-Correlation Alphas**

**
> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> Reduce pairwise correlation (p) by diversifying strategies, datasets, and regions。
> Use operators like  group_neutralize
> and
> group_rank
> to achieve orthogonality。
**

#### **2. Submit Uncorrelated Alphas Across Pyramids**

- Spread Alphas across multiple pyramids to mitigate drawdowns in any single pyramid.

#### **3. Increase the Number of Alphas**

- Add more Alphas to your submission pool, ensuring they remain sufficiently uncorrelated.

#### **4. Prioritize High OS Sharpe Ratios**

- Validate Alphas with the  **Test Period**  and Robustness Tests to avoid overfitting.
- Keep Alpha expressions simple and explainable to enhance  **out-of-sample**  (OS) performance.

### **4. Practical Insights from the Data**

- Submitting  **10 uncorrelated Alphas**  can improve the combined Sharpe by over  **200%**  compared to submitting a single Alpha.
- As correlation increases, the combined Sharpe converges to the average Sharpe, limiting diversification benefits.

### **Final Thoughts**

Maximizing Combined Alpha Performance requires a balance of high individual Sharpe ratios, low correlation, and an appropriately sized Alpha pool. By focusing on orthogonality and robustness, you can unlock the full potential of diversification, build resilience, and climb to higher tiers in the BRAIN Genius Program.

### 评论 #13 (作者: VV63697, 时间: 1年前)

Quite an insightful post so basically if your alpha pool is large enough which is the case for most of the higher tiers then  combined sharpe is directly proportional to average sharpe / sqrt (correlation) .

---

### 评论 #14 (作者: AK44462, 时间: 1年前)

Great insights! Looking at the table, it seems that prioritizing average Sharpe and reducing correlation is more important than submitting a higher number of alphas.

---

### 评论 #15 (作者: SG91420, 时间: 1年前)

This is an excellent method for improving risk management and alpha performance. The secret to optimising diversification, minimising drawdowns, and boosting overall portfolio robustness is to concentrate on low-correlation alphas. By distributing uncorrelated alphas throughout several pyramids, one can reduce risk and make sure that a single underperforming alpha won't have an impact on the strategy as a whole. Building a stronger submission pool requires increasing the number of alphas while keeping correlation low. High out-of-sample Sharpe ratios are also important; make sure your alphas are verified by thorough testing to prevent overfitting. The realisation that submitting several uncorrelated alphas might greatly increase the total Sharpe ratio serves as a potent reminder of how crucial diversification is to creating robust strategies.

Thank you for sharing this comprehensive breakdown of strategies to improve Combined Alpha Performance! The focus on uncorrelated Alphas, robust validation, and strategic diversification is critical for optimizing submissions. I appreciate the actionable insights and the data-driven approach to emphasizing low correlation and out-of-sample Sharpe ratios.

To address some of the community's questions:

Optimal Number of Alphas: Regularly monitor pairwise correlations among Alphas in your pool using tools like correlation matrices. This ensures new additions contribute meaningful diversity without redundancy. Experimenting with orthogonal datasets and varying alpha structures can help maintain low correlations.
Spreading Across Pyramids: While diversification reduces risk, it’s essential to assess regional data quality and coverage. Avoid overextension by prioritizing regions where your alpha concepts perform consistently well.

Thank you for sharing these valuable insights on improving the Combined Alpha Performance Score! I completely agree with your points, especially about the importance of low correlation between Alphas and focusing on out-of-sample performance. It's great to see strategies that emphasize both quantity and quality, like increasing the number of Alphas while maintaining low correlation and prioritizing high Sharpe ratios.

I’d like to add a few thoughts to complement your points:

- **Factor Diversity** : When constructing uncorrelated Alphas, it’s essential to ensure diversity not only in the signals but also in the factors driving those signals. For example, combining fundamental factors (like valuation ratios) with technical factors (like momentum) can help further reduce correlation.
- **Continuous Monitoring and Adjustment** : One other thing I’ve found useful is the continuous review of the performance of your Alphas. It’s important to stay proactive and refine the Alphas periodically, especially if market conditions change, to ensure they remain uncorrelated and robust.

Lastly, regarding the  **Robustness Tests** , it’s crucial to ensure your Alphas not only perform well in the backtest but also in live data with changing market conditions. Running these tests over multiple periods, asset classes, and market environments can give you a stronger indication of how your Alphas will perform in real-world trading.

Thanks again for this insightful post! I'm looking forward to learning more from the community and sharing more strategies as we all progress in the BRAIN Genius Program.

In optimizing the Combined Alpha Performance Score, should the priority be given to increasing the number of Alphas or minimizing their correlation, and how does this trade-off impact overall performance?

---

### 评论 #52 (作者: AB15407, 时间: 1年前)

That's a very detailed sharing. The strategy I'm currently using is quite similar to the viewpoint you've presented, but I haven't really analyzed it as thoroughly as you have.

I agree with the idea of creating Alphas with low correlation and submitting as many of them as possible.

With the formula that Brain has made public, this will lead to a very high Combined score.

---

### 评论 #53 (作者: NT63388, 时间: 1年前)

I also have a question about Super-Alphas. The Merge score has a threshold of 2.0 for GM, while SuperAlphas usually have much better performance (often greater than 4.0 or 5.0).

If SuperAlphas were also included in the Merge score with the same weight as Regular Alphas, then a strategy of creating good SAs would be the simplest way to increase the Merge score, is that correct?

---

### 评论 #54 (作者: KK81152, 时间: 1年前)

To clarify further, the consultant tier in the BRAIN Genius Program is indeed determined by the  **higher value**  between  **Combined Alpha Performance**  and  **Selected Alpha Performance**  at the end of a quarter. So, if either of these metrics surpasses the required threshold, you qualify for the consultant tier.

The insights shared here on maximizing Combined Alpha Performance are quite enlightening! It’s fascinating to see how using uncorrelated Alphas and focusing on their individual strengths can lead to such significant improvements. I’m curious about how you approach ensuring that your Alphas maintain low correlation throughout their lifecycle. Have you found any particular methods or tools that help you achieve this? Sharing experiences could really benefit everyone involved!

Thanks for the key insight! By leveraging low correlations, the low sharpe alphas can combined to a high sharpe alphas. This inspires us to use more economic logic to  **create diverse alpha templates** . We can use this to improve our Genuis performance.
