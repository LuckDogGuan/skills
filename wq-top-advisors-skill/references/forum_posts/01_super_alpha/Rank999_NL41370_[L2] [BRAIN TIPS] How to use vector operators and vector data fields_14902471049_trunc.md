Some useful vector operator tips:

1. **Use vec_avg() or vec_choose() operator to leverage vector fields value when confused.**
   Vector datafields hold a lot of valuable information, but sometimes, it might be difficult to understand how to use the values stored in the vector datafields for any given day. In such cases, the vec_avg() operator is very useful as it takes the average values in the vector for the day which can be used as a good representation of the value of the datafield for that day. Alternatively, sometimes you only need the latest or last value after which all the data is converted to matrix format and ready to use to create alphas.
2. **Some vector data fields can be used as smart alternatives to matrix fields**
   Let’s say you want to use the risk free interest rate in your alpha. You can find that the matrix field that represents the same - “fnd6_newqv1300_optrfrq” has a stock coverage of only 35% in USA, however there is also a vector datafield that represents the same “fnd6_newqeventv110_optrfrq” and has a coverage of 85%, thus it is much better to use the vector datafield. That said, you cannot directly use this field in your alphas as you normally do for matrix data type. Instead of using “fnd6_newqeventv110_optrfrq” directly for the risk free rate, you can instead use vec_avg(fnd6_newqeventv110_optrfrq).
3. **Use vec_sum() operator to calculate the total daily values of some datafields.**  Eg. ‘scl12_alltype_buzzvec’ datafield can have sentiment volume of stocks stored through the day. Thus vec_sum operator can give total daily sentiment volume of the stock, which is useful for creating Delay-1 alphas.
4. For choosing  **the last value stored in the vector datafield for the day** , vec_choose(datafield,nth=k) is a useful operator. This can be very useful for creating  **Delay-0 alphas**  as using this operator can take the latest value of the datafield which can provide more value for D0 alphas.
5. **Vector neutralization:**  Vector neutralization is a technique that can be used to neutralize your alphas over certain risk factors to some extent, e.g., momentum risk.

Example: vector_neut(alpha,ts_ir(returns,240)) may reduce some momentum factor risk from your alpha and thus as a result marginally improve Sharpe of the alpha. A better implementation for the same can be to use the group_vector_neut operator.

Example: group_vector_neut(alpha,ts_ir(returns,240),subindustry) can neutralize the alpha using the momentum vector at the subindustry grouping level and sometimes can be more impactful depending on the alpha.

One thing to note is that the vector_neut() and the group_vector_neut() operator are not limited to vector data fields. The alpha and the vector used to neutralize the alpha can both be from matrix data type fields. The ‘vector’ neutralization is because the alpha vector is neutralized by another vector, in the above example the neutralizing vector being ts_ir(returns,240).

I would like to ask why Brain does not convert vectors to matrices before publishing data to users, but instead creates vector functions for users to convert themselves.

Can you provide examples of scenarios where the vec_sum() operator might be more beneficial than other methods of data aggregation in alpha research?

I would like to ask why the self corr data in the combo expression has 3 dimensions, and besides that data, is there any other data that can use the reduce operator?

[TT55495](/hc/en-us/profiles/13132630342807-TT55495)  maybe when using analyst data you want to pay more attention to the stocks that are recommended often by many analysts or brokers or institutions

The use of vector operators like  `vec_avg()` ,  `vec_choose()` , and  `vec_sum()`  can significantly enhance how you work with vector data fields, helping streamline alpha generation. By leveraging these operators, you can efficiently calculate averages, select the most recent values, and sum up values over a period, making them especially useful for creating Delay-0 or Delay-1 alphas. Additionally, vector neutralization techniques like  `vector_neut()`  and  `group_vector_neut()`  can help neutralize risk factors, improving the robustness of your strategies. These tools allow for more precise and effective data processing in alpha research.

Users can have the freedom to choose the way to convert vector into matrix by themselves in this way.

**vec_avg()** : This operator computes the average of the vector’s values for a specific day. It’s a good way to summarize the datafield when you’re unsure how to interpret all the values within the vector for a given day.
