Currently, the restricted access to certain operators can sometimes hinder seamless workflow and limit the ability to build quality alphas. Even the basic operators are not available. For instance:

- "<" - Less Than operators
- is_not_nan operator
- ts_kurtosis
- vector_neut

Yes, I'm also facing issues due to non availability of the basic operators, although they made available some of the operator today, but still it is very minimal.

### 评论 #2 (作者: CM45657, 时间: 1年前)

you can reverse the greater than operator

Would like to add  **ts_ir()**  to the list as this operator is useful in implementing projections and creating combos for SA.

Hi  [CM45657](/hc/en-us/profiles/26410069297303-CM45657)

Your suggestion is great but this will increase operator per alpha unnecessarily.

Hi, for ts_ir, you can implement it as ts_mean()/ts_std(), which also has the same effect. For vector_neut I think Brain should reuse this operator.

Currently, restricted access to certain operators can disrupt workflow and limit the ability to build quality alphas. Operators such as "<" (Less Than),  `is_not_nan` ,  `ts_kurtosis` , and  `vector_neut`  may be unavailable, but there are workarounds. For the Less Than operator, reverse the logic by using ">" (Greater Than). To handle NaN values instead of  `is_not_nan` , use  `if_else(is(nan), -1, alpha)` . For  `ts_kurtosis` , calculate kurtosis normally and apply  `ts_delay`  to introduce time-shifting. By using these reverse approaches, you can continue to develop effective alphas despite the limitations on available operators.

Thanks @TL60820,
I had trouble with the points you just mentioned.
Although it seems to have solved the problem, the number of operators to use will increase.
Maybe everyone will have to try and make more effort to reach higher levels.

Thanks  [TL60820](/hc/en-us/profiles/13171997597975-TL60820)

By implementing these alternative approaches, quantitative analysts can continue developing robust and effective alpha strategies despite the limitations imposed by restricted operator access.

Restricted access to key operators like  `<` ,  `is_not_nan` ,  `ts_kurtosis` , and  `vector_neut`  can indeed hinder alpha creation. However, you can use workarounds like  `if_else(a < b, 1, 0)`  for  `<` ,  `not(is_nan(x))`  for  `is_not_nan` , and combine  `vector_proj`  with subtraction to mimic  `vector_neut` . While not ideal, these solutions help maintain functionality until access is expanded.

Few  **single**  Operators allow writing better quality alphas; for eg ts_tvr_hump(), ts_tvr_delta_limit(), ts_ir(), group_cartesian_product(), group_std_dev() ; would be win-win if more operators are allowed to promote ease of usage + efficiency.

### 评论 #12 (作者: QG16026, 时间: 1年前)

The restricted access to certain key operators like "<", is_not_nan, ts_kurtosis, and vector_neut can certainly disrupt the process of building effective alphas. However, using alternative methods like reversing the logic for "<" with ">", replacing is_not_nan with if_else(is(nan), -1, alpha), and calculating kurtosis manually with ts_delay can help overcome these limitations.

Dear Fellow Consultants,

Thanks for your valuable suggestion to use the alternative operators such as replacing  `ts_ir`  with  `ts_mean()/ts_std()`  and using  `reverse(>)`  in place of  `<` . While these alternatives can help achieve the desired goal,  **they will unnecessarily increase the number of operators per alpha** , which could  **negatively impact leaderboard rankings** .

Thanks for the useful information I have fixed that problem but it increases the number of operators needed to implement the operator I need. Quite difficult for the research process

---

### 评论 #15 (作者: RB20756, 时间: 1年前)

Hi, 
Even if there is workaround for most of the operators but it will increase the number of operators per alphas which again hinder the growth cycle of consultants present at gold/ expert level.

### 评论 #16 (作者: AC63290, 时间: 1年前)

Restricted access to essential operators like  `<` ,  `is_not_nan` ,  `ts_kurtosis` , and  `vector_neut`  can indeed hinder alpha development by limiting flexibility and creativity. These operators are crucial for filtering data, handling missing values, measuring data distributions, and neutralizing signals.

To address this, WorldQuant could consider providing basic operator access across all levels to ensure a seamless workflow for consultants. This would enhance the ability to build robust alphas without unnecessary constraints. Additionally, transparency about restricted operators and alternatives would help researchers adapt their strategies effectively.

A more inclusive approach would empower consultants to focus on innovation and quality alpha creation. 🚀

Hello,

Operator group_std_dev() is key in writing few robust alphas, do suggest workaround for this one?

Reinforcement learning has shown promise in dynamic portfolio optimization. How do you design a reward function that balances risk-adjusted returns with turnover constraints, and what are the challenges of training reinforcement learning models in noisy financial environments?

### 评论 #19 (作者: QN13195, 时间: 1年前)

Due to the restrictions in access to these essential operators, we are likely to face significant challenges in their workflows, affecting the efficiency and quality of the outcomes. Let challenge!

- **Basic Operators Are Blocked**  – Simple yet essential operators like  `<` ,  `is_not_nan` ,  `ts_kurtosis` , and  `vector_neut`  are unavailable, forcing workarounds that increase operator count.
- **Workarounds Increase Complexity**  – While alternatives exist (e.g., reversing  `<`  with  `>` , replacing  `is_not_nan`  with  `if_else(is(nan), -1, alpha)` ), they often lead to higher operator counts, which can negatively impact ranking.
- **Need for Transparency & Fair Access**  – Many consultants feel that access to fundamental operators should not be restricted and that clearer guidelines would help researchers adapt their strategies.

### 评论 #21 (作者: PT27687, 时间: 1年前)

You've raised an important point about the impact of restricted access on workflow and alpha building. It must be a little difficult to work with limited operators, especially when trying to create effective solutions. Have you considered any potential alternatives?

---

### 评论 #22 (作者: 顾问 HY90970 (Rank 54), 时间: 1年前)

Hi, I think ts_ir(x,d) can be implemented by using available operators at 'GOLD' level as follows:
ts_mean(ts_delta(x,1),d)/ts_std_dev(ts_delta(x,1),d).

NOTE: Although, ts_mean(x,d)/ts_std_dev(x,d) is worth trying as well.

Hope, this helps.

### 评论 #23 (作者: PT27687, 时间: 1年前)

It seems that limited access to certain operators can indeed create challenges in developing and refining alphas effectively. It raises questions about how these restrictions impact overall performance and results. Have you found any workarounds or alternative methods to achieve similar outcomes with the current constraints?
