SuperAlphas combine different Alphas within a region and/or universe. Using the BRAIN API in ACE, you can automate your SuperAlpha research and introduce new selection and combination methods for building them! In this forum post, we explore some ways in which you can implement these ideas.

- **Selection of Alphas:**

Selecting the Alphas is the first and a very critical step in building SuperAlphas. Some ways in which you can improve your Alpha selection for ACE:

1. **Adding tags based on ideas:**  All the Alphas simulated as part of ACE by default get ‘ace_tag’ to them. Additionally, you can also add your own custom tags with  **set_alpha_properties()**  function of ace_lib. These tags can be based on your idea, like mean-reversion-tag / momentum-tag or type of dataset, like fundamental-tag / pv-tag.

Consequently, while creating ACE scripts for selecting Alphas for SuperAlpha, you can directly select all the Alphas under a tag by using selection expression like:

**in(tags, “ace_tag”)**

**in(tags, “mean-reversion-tag”)**

1. **Based on alpha properties / data fields:**  SuperAlphas can also be selected based on a wise set of Alpha properties like turnover, correlation as well as datasets and individual data fields used inside the Alpha. The entire list of properties available for SuperAlpha selection is present  [here](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/superalpha/selection-expression) .

You can create ACE scripts that iterate through different types of selections based on properties/datasets. With each selection, you get a unique set Alphas that can be used for building SuperAlphas!

- **Combination of Alphas:**

After selecting the desired Alphas from the Alpha pool, a combination logic also needs to be defined. It can simply be ‘ **1** ’, which would give equal weights to each Alpha or an advanced logic based on an Alpha’s stats. The full list of combination logic is present  [here](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/superalpha/combo-expression) .

For example, in order to give more weight to Alphas that have good performance in recent time, the following combination logic can be used:

**stats = generate_stats(alpha);**

**ts_ir(stats.returns, <lookback days>)**

Finding the right lookback days can be automated for ACE by checking SuperAlpha performance for different values (1 year, 1 quarter, 1 month, 1 week etc.) through a loop.

The article on building SuperAlphas in ACE deepened my understanding of how powerful combining different Alphas can be, especially for creating strategies that are both robust and diversified. I was particularly intrigued by how the selection process works. By using custom tags like "mean-reversion-tag" or "momentum-tag," I can organize and filter Alphas more effectively, ensuring that I choose those that best fit the strategic goals I’m pursuing. The ability to select Alphas based on their properties, such as turnover or correlation, is a valuable tool for optimizing my SuperAlpha pool.

What excites me the most is the combination logic, especially the use of recent performance metrics, like the time-series information ratio (ts_ir). This method allows me to assign greater weight to more successful Alphas, giving me a dynamic way to fine-tune my portfolio. The idea of automating the lookback period to evaluate performance is also appealing because it simplifies the testing and optimization process. This framework gives me great confidence in designing smarter, more tailored SuperAlphas for a variety of market conditions.

This is a great guide on how to leverage the BRAIN API in ACE for SuperAlpha development! The ability to tag Alphas based on themes like mean-reversion or momentum will certainly help in efficiently filtering the right candidates. I particularly like the idea of dynamically selecting Alphas using properties and data fields, which provides more flexibility in forming a well-rounded SuperAlpha. Automating the lookback period to evaluate recent performance also seems like a smart move to ensure you’re prioritizing the most relevant Alphas at any given time. Excited to see how these techniques can improve alpha performance!

This post offers valuable insights into the SuperAlpha framework and its implementation using the BRAIN API. I'm particularly intrigued by the idea of using custom tags for Alpha selection; it seems like a powerful method to streamline the process. Have you had any success with specific tags or combination logics that have significantly improved performance? It would be great to hear more about your experiences!
