Hii,

I would like to ask that, in combo expression "returns" datafield is use in "stats.returns", what other datafield can be used and where to find list of that.

Hi, you can use turnover, drawdown, pnl, long and short count, you can check in super alpha documentation. The generate_stats() operator calculates the following daily statistics for each Alpha:

You can use other datafields like:

```
"long_value""short_value","pnl","returns","drawdown","long_count","short_count","hold_value","trade_value","hold_shares","trade_shares","hold_pnl","trade_pnl","turnover"
```

to refine your combo expression. These help balance risk and return.

For a full list, check the official docs in learn section!

Focus on Selection Combination is the key to choosing your alpha effectively. By using tags or categories, you can filter and select the best alpha from the pool.

First, set the Weight Combination to 1, but only start focusing on weight adjustments after submitting at least 10 super alphas. This ensures a solid foundation before fine-tuning.

Next, set Neutralization to "Market." This setting works consistently, even if you apply Subindustry, Sector, or Slow adjustments in your component alpha. A broader selection of alphas enhances robustness.

When choosing a region, prioritize the one with the highest number of regularly submitted alphas. This improves stability and diversification.

For operators, I avoid those with a heavy impact on my alpha. I always apply the rank operator outside the weight combination, preserving the coverage of single_element. Maintaining good coverage is crucial, as low coverage can significantly increase drawdown risk.

For example, I generate statistics with  `stats = generate_stats(alpha);`  and then apply  `rank(-stats.turnover)` . Once this setup is stable, I experiment with higher-impact operators, such as time-series transformations or removing rank, to refine performance further.

Effective alpha selection relies on  **Selection Combination** , using  **tags or categories**  to filter and identify the best candidates.

1. **Weight Combination** : Start with  **1**  and focus on weight adjustments only after submitting at least  **10 super alphas**  to establish a solid foundation.
2. **Neutralization** : Set to  **Market**  for consistent performance, even when applying  **Subindustry, Sector, or Slow**  adjustments. A broader alpha selection enhances robustness.
3. **Region Selection** : Prioritize regions with the  **highest number of regularly submitted alphas**  to improve stability and diversification.
4. **Operators** : Avoid those with a  **heavy impact**  on your alpha. Apply the  **rank operator outside the weight combination**  to preserve  **single_element coverage** , minimizing drawdown risk.

For example, generate statistics using  `stats = generate_stats(alpha);`  and apply  `rank(-stats.turnover)` . Once stable, experiment with  **higher-impact operators** , such as time-series transformations or removing rank, to refine performance further.

In a combo expression,  **"returns"**  is commonly used within  `stats.returns` , but other  **datafields**  can also be utilized, depending on the performance metrics you want to analyze.

### **Alternative Datafields in  `stats`**

- **stats.drawdown**  → Measures peak-to-trough decline, useful for risk management.
- **stats.volatility**  → Tracks the variability of returns, helping assess stability.
- **stats.sharpe_ratio**  → Evaluates return efficiency relative to risk.
- **stats.sortino_ratio**  → Focuses on downside risk-adjusted returns.
- **stats.max_drawdown**  → Identifies the worst observed loss from peak value.
- **stats.beta**  → Measures sensitivity to the market.
- **stats.alpha**  → Evaluates excess return relative to a benchmark.
- **stats.turnover**  → Helps analyze trading frequency.

### you can find ít at alpha statistics.

Using the right  **datafields**  can enhance signal refinement and improve alpha robustness! 🚀

Great question! Regarding the combo expression, if you're using the "returns" datafield with "stats.returns," there are several other datafields you can utilize, depending on the specific data you're looking for. You can typically find a list of available datafields in the platform’s documentation or through the data explorer section.

### 评论 #32 (作者: AK40989, 时间: 1年前)

It looks like you've got a solid list of data fields to work with for your combo expression! Beyond the ones mentioned, have you thought about how incorporating metrics like "turnover" or "drawdown" could impact your alpha's risk-return profile? It might be interesting to experiment with different combinations to see which metrics provide the most insight into your model's performance.

### 评论 #33 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 1年前)

Effective alpha selection hinges on Selection Combination—using tags or categories to filter and identify strong candidates. Start Weight Combination at 1, focusing on weight adjustments only after submitting at least 10 Super Alphas for a solid foundation. Set Neutralization to  *Market*  for consistent performance, even when testing Subindustry or Sector levels. Broader selection enhances robustness, while prioritizing regions with high alpha submission frequency improves diversification.

Use low-impact operators initially to minimize drawdown risk. For example, apply  `stats = generate_stats(alpha)`  and rank based on  `-stats.turnover`  to maintain coverage. Once stable, experiment with impactful operators like time-series transformations.

Explore alternative stats fields—such as  `stats.drawdown` ,  `stats.volatility` ,  `stats.sharpe_ratio` , or  `stats.alpha` —to refine signals and balance risk-reward. Leveraging the right metrics helps improve stability and robustness.

Have you found specific combinations or stats fields that consistently boost performance while managing risk efficiently?
