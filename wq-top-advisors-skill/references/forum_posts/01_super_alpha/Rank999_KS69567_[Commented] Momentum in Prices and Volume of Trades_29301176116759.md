## 帖子正文

This study reveals a key relationship between  **past trading volume**  and both  **momentum**  and  **value**  strategies, highlighting its predictive power for future stock performance. Specifically, firms with high  **past turnover ratios**  (indicative of higher trading volume) tend to exhibit  **glamour**  characteristics, earn lower future returns, and experience more  **negative earnings surprises** . Conversely, firms with low turnover ratios align with  **value**  characteristics, earn higher future returns, and show more  **positive earnings surprises**  over the next eight quarters.

Furthermore, past trading volume is a strong predictor of both the  **magnitude**  and  **persistence**  of  **price momentum** . The study finds that  **momentum effects**  tend to reverse over a five-year horizon, with high-volume winners and low-volume losers experiencing  **faster reversals** .

The study’s findings provide several deeper insights into the relationship between  **past trading volume** ,  **momentum** , and  **value**  strategies, with implications for both asset pricing and investment strategies:

1. **Momentum and Value Strategies** : The study shows that  **high past trading volume**  correlates with stocks exhibiting  **glamour characteristics** , which tend to earn  **lower future returns** . On the other hand,  **low past trading volume**  is associated with stocks that have  **value characteristics** , which historically generate  **higher future returns** . This suggests that investors who focus on high-volume stocks may be chasing recent price gains (glamour), while those focusing on low-volume stocks may be buying underappreciated or undervalued assets.
2. **Earnings Surprises** : The study also highlights that firms with  **high past trading volume**  tend to have  **more negative earnings surprises**  in the following quarters, while firms with  **low past trading volume**  tend to experience  **more positive earnings surprises** . This is important for forecasting earnings results, as  **momentum stocks**  are often priced with overly optimistic expectations, leading to negative earnings surprises, while  **value stocks**  may be underappreciated, leading to positive surprises.
3. **Price Momentum and Reversals** : The study shows that  **price momentum**  effects (where stocks continue to move in the same direction) tend to reverse over time, particularly within a  **five-year horizon** . Stocks with  **high volume**  that have been  **winners**  (rising prices) are likely to experience  **faster reversals** , while  **low-volume losers**  (declining stocks) also experience reversals. This insight challenges traditional momentum strategies and emphasizes that the persistence of price momentum is temporary, especially for stocks with extreme trading volumes.
4. **Intermediate-Horizon Underreaction and Long-Horizon Overreaction** : The findings effectively reconcile the  **underreaction**  and  **overreaction**  effects observed in asset pricing. At shorter horizons (e.g., intermediate-term), stocks with high trading volume may be subject to underreaction, where market prices fail to fully adjust to new information, creating opportunities for momentum. However, over longer horizons, the  **overreaction**  effect takes hold, where stocks that have experienced momentum begin to experience reversals as the market corrects itself, indicating  **market inefficiency** .

### Implications for Investment Strategies:

- **Trading Volume as a Signal** : Traders and investors can use past trading volume as a signal to gauge potential future returns and adjust their portfolios accordingly. High-volume stocks may indicate a  **momentum**  strategy, while low-volume stocks could align with a  **value**  strategy.
- **Timing of Momentum Strategies** : The study suggests that momentum strategies should be adjusted over time, with caution for longer-term holding periods.  **Faster reversals**  in high-volume winners and low-volume losers suggest that  **momentum strategies**  may need to be shortened in duration to avoid losses from price corrections.
- **Predictive Power for Earnings** : Past trading volume could be integrated into  **earnings prediction models** . High-volume stocks may have a higher probability of negative earnings surprises, while low-volume stocks may signal potential positive earnings surprises.
- **Enhancing Risk-Adjusted Returns** : By incorporating insights from past volume trends, investors can better manage risk and improve the risk-adjusted returns of their momentum and value strategies. Recognizing when momentum is likely to reverse or when value opportunities are undervalued based on volume trends can lead to more informed decision-making.

These findings underscore the importance of  **trading volume**  as a significant factor in understanding and predicting stock performance, and offer actionable insights for adjusting both  **momentum**  and  **value**  strategies to align with market dynamics and time horizons.

Overall, the findings suggest that  **past trading volume**  plays a critical role in explaining the dynamics between  **intermediate-horizon underreaction**  (where market prices fail to fully adjust to new information) and  **long-horizon overreaction**  (where prices correct due to overreaction to past trends). These insights help to reconcile and better understand the behavior of stocks over different time horizons, offering valuable implications for developing  **momentum and value-based strategies** .

Thank you for sharing such an insightful post! From what I’ve understood, here are a couple of alpha ideas inspired by your findings:

### Alpha Idea 1: Low - Volume Value Stocks

**Expression** :

```
rank(-ts_corr(ts_mean(volume, 20), price, 60) * ts_zscore(volume, 20))

```

Focuses on undervalued stocks with low trading volume.

### Alpha Idea 2: High Volume Momentum with Reversals

**Expression** :

```
rank(ts_delta(close, 5) * quantile(ts_zscore(volume, 10), driver = gaussian, sigma = 0.8))

```

Captures short-term momentum in high-volume stocks while addressing reversal risks.

If your factors are heavily influenced by the performance of specific sectors or industries, this can introduce unwanted exposure and increase correlation. Neutralizing factors related to industry or sector ensures that your alpha signals remain agnostic to such systematic influences. For example, if one sector (like technology) is outperforming, neutralization ensures that your signals are still effective across a range of industries.

**Industry, Sector, or Size Neutralization** : One common source of noise in alpha factors comes from systematic exposures like industry, sector, or size. If your factors are too sensitive to these, they may just be capturing the general performance of a particular sector or market size rather than unique alpha. By  **neutralizing**  these factors, you ensure that your alpha is more likely to be driven by unique, non-systematic factors rather than broad market trends. This results in more meaningful signals that are less likely to be overly correlated with those broader systematic effects.

- **Diversification** : A well-diversified portfolio can reduce idiosyncratic risk, leading to better long-term performance. This is often evaluated in terms of correlation between assets.
- **Position Sizing** : How the capital is allocated across positions can also affect performance. A balanced approach to position sizing helps in mitigating risks.

### 评论 #12 (作者: SB24011, 时间: 1年前)

Thank you for sharing this study - it's fascinating how past trading volume can predict so many key aspects of stock behavior, especially with respect to momentum and value strategies. The link between high trading volume and glamour stocks with lower future returns, versus low trading volume and value stocks with higher future returns, is particularly insightful. I also found the analysis of price momentum reversals very compelling - it definitely challenges the traditional view that momentum persists indefinitely.

One question I had after reading this is:  ***How do you suggest adjusting momentum strategies over time in light of the faster reversals observed in high-volume winners and low-volume losers? Would it be more effective to use shorter holding periods, or should other factors be considered to optimize the timing of these strategies?***

Got it! Momentum strategies thrive in strong market sentiment and low-volatility conditions, but I’m curious—how can we identify when a trend might reverse despite favorable conditions? Also, how do you balance following momentum trends while avoiding overvalued stocks that might crash? For implementing these strategies, what’s the best way to measure the impact of analyst upgrades on stock prices? Additionally, since momentum relies on herding behavior and delayed reactions, how can we distinguish these from overhyped trends? Lastly, could you share practical steps to track job postings effectively for momentum research?

Momentum is a key concept in alpha research, and it capitalizes on the idea that assets that have recently performed well will likely continue to perform well, while those that have performed poorly will continue to struggle. Here's a deeper dive into the  **Momentum**  strategy and how you can apply it:

### **What is Momentum?**

Momentum refers to the phenomenon where assets tend to continue their price trends (either up or down) due to various psychological and market-driven factors. Investors often notice this trend-following behavior, where a stock that is rising in price is likely to keep rising, and a stock falling in price is likely to keep falling.

Momentum can be driven by:

- **Herding Behavior:**  Investors follow the actions of others, contributing to self-reinforcing trends.
- **Delayed Reactions to Information:**  The market takes time to fully incorporate new information into asset prices.

Momentum can manifest in both  **short-term (days-weeks)**  and  **medium-term (weeks-months)**  trends, influenced by factors such as news flow, earnings reports, and broader economic conditions.

### 评论 #19 (作者: SK14400, 时间: 1年前)

The study captures both  **short-term momentum effects**  and  **long-term reversals** , providing a well-rounded view of how stocks behave across different time horizons. but how do broader  **economic conditions**  (e.g., interest rates, inflation) influence the relationship between past trading volume, momentum, and value strategies?

### 评论 #20 (作者: LR13671, 时间: 1年前)

This is an excellent breakdown of how past trading volume serves as a dual indicator for both momentum and value strategies. The distinction between high-volume glamour stocks and low-volume value stocks is insightful, especially the emphasis on how these differences translate into earnings surprises and future returns. A must-read for anyone refining their predictive models!

### 评论 #21 (作者: AS16039, 时间: 1年前)

Thank you for sharing this insightful study! The relationship between past trading volume, momentum, and value strategies is fascinating, and the detailed analysis provides clear, actionable insights for refining investment approaches. I especially appreciate how the findings shed light on the predictive power of trading volume for stock performance, earnings surprises, and price momentum.

The suggestion to adjust momentum strategies based on trading volume and the emphasis on momentum reversals are valuable for optimizing portfolio construction. I also found the implications for risk-adjusted returns and earnings predictions particularly helpful.

### 评论 #22 (作者: AK52014, 时间: 1年前)

Neutralizing industry, sector, or size exposures helps reduce noise in alpha factors. Sensitivity to these systematic effects often captures broad market trends rather than unique alpha. Neutralization ensures signals reflect non-systematic factors, resulting in more meaningful, distinct alphas with lower correlation to broader market movements.

---

### 评论 #23 (作者: TN51777, 时间: 1年前)

Thank you for your sharing, the study highlights the predictive power of past trading volume in shaping momentum and value strategies. High past trading volume is linked to glamour stocks, which tend to deliver lower future returns and experience negative earnings surprises. Conversely, stocks with low trading volumes, often characterized by value traits, are associated with higher future returns and positive earnings surprises. This relationship suggests that volume can be used as a valuable signal for identifying potential winners and losers in stock performance.

---

### 评论 #24 (作者: TN51777, 时间: 1年前)

Furthermore, the study reveals that price momentum effects are temporary, particularly over longer time horizons. High-volume winners tend to reverse more quickly, while low-volume losers also experience reversals. This challenges traditional momentum strategies and suggests that momentum may not persist beyond a few years. For investors, integrating trading volume into decision-making can enhance risk-adjusted returns by adjusting momentum strategies to shorter time frames and using volume as a predictor for earnings outcomes.

### 评论 #29 (作者: LR13671, 时间: 1年前)

Great insights! The faster reversal of high-volume momentum stocks suggests that traders might need to adjust their exit strategies. Have you considered how stop-loss mechanisms or dynamic holding periods could optimize returns?

### 评论 #30 (作者: NH16784, 时间: 1年前)

Hi, I'm quite confused about the aspect of Price Momentum and Reversals: the time a stock spends following a trend is usually longer than the time it takes for the stock to return to its average value, right? Can you share some data on this issue? Thank you very much.

---

### 评论 #31 (作者: 顾问 LN62753 (Rank 73), 时间: 1年前)

The duration of price trends versus the speed of reversals can depend on factors like market conditions, liquidity, and investor behavior. While momentum effects often persist in the short to medium term, reversals—especially for high-volume stocks—can be sharper due to rapid sentiment shifts and profit-taking. It might be useful to analyze past return distributions across different holding periods to quantify this effect more precisely.

### 评论 #34 (作者: 顾问 LQ40660 (Rank 72), 时间: 1年前)

The time a stock maintains momentum is generally longer than the time it reverts to the mean, but this depends on factors such as liquidity, market volatility, and investor sentiment. One way to test this phenomenon is by using the Bayesian Change Point Detection method to identify dynamic reversal points under different market conditions. Additionally, if you check the Sharpe ratio of momentum-based strategies across different time frames, you may find that holding momentum stocks for extended periods can reduce performance effectiveness due to the impact of mean reversion.

The duration a stock maintains its trend is usually longer than the time it takes to revert to its mean value, but the extent of this difference depends on factors such as liquidity, market volatility, and investor sentiment.

One approach to quantifying this is to analyze the time ratio between the trending phase and the mean-reversion phase across different liquidity groups. Some studies also indicate that stocks with high trading volume tend to reverse more quickly due to investor overreaction, while low-volume stocks may sustain their trends for longer as information is absorbed more slowly.

It highlights how crucial trading volume is when developing investment strategies. Additionally, the idea that momentum strategies should be adjusted over time is something I’ll definitely keep in mind. Understanding these dynamics could really help refine my approach in the market. Looking forward to digging deeper into these concepts!

The study highlights that trading volume plays a crucial role in generating alpha, impacting both momentum and value strategies. High volume stocks often exhibit short term momentum but are more prone to rapid reversals, while low-volume stocks tend to be undervalued and have long term alpha potential. By incorporating volume into trading models, investors can optimize entry and exit timing, enhance returns, and manage the risks associated with momentum reversals

---

### 评论 #40 (作者: DA51810, 时间: 1年前)

Many have pointed out that high-volume winners reverse faster than low-volume losers. This suggests that momentum-based trading strategies should have adaptive exit strategies. Instead of fixed holding periods, traders could implement dynamic position sizing or trailing stop-loss mechanisms to exit positions when reversal signals appear. Additionally, considering liquidity constraints could help avoid large price impacts when unwinding positions. Has anyone experimented with volatility-adjusted holding periods?

Heyy @  [顾问 PN39025 (Rank 87)](/hc/en-us/profiles/1532011933942-顾问 PN39025 (Rank 87))

The relationship between  **past trading volume, momentum** , and  **value strategies**  informs the development of investment strategies by helping to balance  **underreaction**  in the short term with  **overreaction**  in the long term:

- **Trading Volume** : High volume can signal momentum, often indicating that a stock has the potential for continued movement in the same direction.
- **Momentum** : Captures trends where past price movements suggest continued performance, typically aligning with short-term underreaction (markets are slow to react to new information).
- **Value** : Identifies undervalued stocks, often subject to long-term overreaction (prices overshoot or correct significantly after being mispriced).

To balance  **underreaction (intermediate-horizon)**  and  **overreaction (long-horizon)** , a strategy could use  **momentum for shorter-term positioning**  while  **value factors**  help guide longer-term investments, taking advantage of market corrections and mean reversion. This allows you to capture  **short-term gains**  from momentum and  **long-term recovery**  from value mispricing.

### 评论 #42 (作者: AS16039, 时间: 1年前)

Past trading volume significantly impacts momentum and value strategies. High-volume stocks exhibit faster reversals, while low-volume stocks align with value characteristics, yielding higher future returns. Incorporating volume trends into alpha models enhances predictive power, risk-adjusted returns, and momentum timing.

### 评论 #48 (作者: LK29993, 时间: 1年前)

Hi  [PT27687](/hc/en-us/profiles/14602596976791-PT27687) !

Let's use this first finding as an example:

- ***Trading Volume as a Signal** : Traders and investors can use past trading volume as a signal to gauge potential future returns and adjust their portfolios accordingly. High-volume stocks may indicate a  **momentum**  strategy, while low-volume stocks could align with a  **value**  strategy.*

This finding can be formulated into a hypothesis like this:

- If past trading volume is high, go long on stocks with high momentum and short on stocks with low momentum.
- If past trading volume is low, go long on stocks with high value and short on stocks with low value.

This hypothesis can then be implemented as an Alpha like this:

- Use conditional operators such as if_else and trade_when to consider the two different scenarios - when past trading volume is high, vs when past trading volume is low.
- Think of how to represent past trading volume, e.g. sum of the past trading volume for the past week, average trading volume for the past 20 days, etc.
- Form a momentum alpha for the first condition - when past trading volume is high. Refer to example from PP87148 above.
- Form a value alpha for the second condition - when past trading volume is low. Value can be represented by book value per share for example.

This is a simple exercise you can go through to create an alpha: finding > hypothesis > alpha. Try this out for all the other findings. After you've found one possible alpha implementation of a finding, don't stop there too. Find more possible implementations, and more hypotheses from each finding. All the best!
