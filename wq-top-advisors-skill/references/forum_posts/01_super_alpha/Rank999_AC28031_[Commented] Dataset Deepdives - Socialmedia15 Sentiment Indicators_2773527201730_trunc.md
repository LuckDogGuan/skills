## 帖子正文

The Sentiment Indicators dataset provides useful information through social media which is a unique source of creating orthogonal Alphas to your current pool.

**Dataset Highlights:** 
The dataset has coverage only in Delay-1 and can be used to create Alphas across 4 regions:

- [USA](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/socialmedia15?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=USA&universe=TOP3000) : 31 fields
- [EUR](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/socialmedia15?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=EUR&universe=TOP1200) : 13 fields
- [ASI](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/socialmedia15?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=ASI&universe=MINVOL1M) : 3 fields: buzz, sentiment, emotional sentiment
- [AMR](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/socialmedia15?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=AMR&universe=TOP600) : 20 fields

**Points to note:**

- It is important to note the scale of values for the datafields in this dataset to create good quality Alphas.
- All the values in the dataset are scaled to have a score either between 0 to 1 or -1 to +1.
- For most datafields, the ratings/scores are skewed towards a particular value.

*For example:*

The datafield innovation score has a range of values between 0 to 1. However looking at the spread of the data distribution provides more information about how to use the datafields in a better way to create Alphas:

When simulating using none neutralization, and selecting only those stocks that have a score above 0.5, the long count displays very few selection of stocks.

While the same for scores below 0.5, shows many stocks selected as can be seen below. This information can be used very wisely to understand outlier behavior within the datafields and using operators that take into account such behavior to place weights on the stocks.

The same is true also in the case of other datafields in the dataset like scl15_d1_buzz.

**Here are a few additional essential points you must know to create Alphas using this dataset:**

1. Make sure to check for the spread of the data. Use expressions from this post to know how you can quickly evaluate any datafield:  [[L2] [BRAIN TIPS] 6 ways to quickly evaluate a new datasetFeatured_11807866133911.md]([L2] [BRAIN TIPS] 6 ways to quickly evaluate a new datasetFeatured_11807866133911.md)
2. The dataset has vector data. Using vector datafields is essential for using any matrix operations. Within vector operators, operators like vec_avg(), vec_max(), vec_sum() may be preferred over vec_choose() as they provide a better idea about social media activity throughout the day rather than only end of day data.
3. Within vector operators, using vec_avg(), vec_max(), vec_sum() may provide a signal with varying turnover values, thus the vector operator must be carefully selected based on the hypothesis of the Alpha.
4. **Stock Screening:** You may use datafields within conditions within the Alpha. Eg: Identifying the stocks with the lowest Trust, or screening companies with the highest Fear or Anger.
5. Read research papers on social media sentiment impact on stock prices.
   Eg:  [https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/aaaj-08-2020-4786/full/html](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/aaaj-08-2020-4786/full/html)
   This research paper analyzed Twitter data and showed that negative emotions, including fear and anger, strongly impacted the Italian stock index (FTSE MIB). This study used a Granger causality approach and found a high correlation between negative tweets and stock price declines, suggesting that emotional responses during crises can indeed predict market movements as they heighten perceived risk
   Datafields to use:  [scl15_d1_anger](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-fields/scl15_d1_anger?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&region=USA&universe=TOP3000) ,  [scl15_d1_fear](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-fields/scl15_d1_fear?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&region=USA&universe=TOP3000)

This is a fantastic deep dive into the  **Socialmedia15 Sentiment Indicators**  dataset! The emphasis on understanding data distribution and using vector operators thoughtfully is especially helpful.

The observation about emotional sentiment—like fear and anger—having a predictive impact aligns well with behavioral finance theories. I wonder if combining these fields with other datasets (like volume or volatility data) could enhance Alpha performance by capturing sentiment-driven spikes in market activity.

Also, how effective have you found vec_avg() compared to vec_max() in reducing noise while maintaining signal robustness?

Would love to hear more about your experiences with cross-region comparisons or creating region-specific Alphas. This dataset seems promising for crafting orthogonal signals!

Hello,  [AT56452](/hc/en-us/profiles/16716798553111-AT56452) ,

To write expressions for conditions such as identifying stocks with the lowest Trust or screening companies with the highest Fear or Anger using the Socialmedia15 (Sentiment Indicators) dataset, you can use conditional operators like  `if_else.`

Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Identifying Stocks with the Lowest Trust:**
   - You can use the  `rank`  operator to rank the Trust values and then use the  `if_else`  operator to filter out the stocks with the lowest Trust values.
   - `if_else(rank(snt_social_trust) < 0.1, -1, 0)`
   This expression assigns a weight of -1 to the stocks with the lowest 10% Trust values and 0 to others.
2. **Screening Companies with the Highest Fear:**
   - Similarly, you can rank the Fear values and use the  `if_else`  operator to filter out the stocks with the highest Fear values.
   - `if_else(rank(snt_social_fear) > 0.9, 1, 0)`
   This expression assigns a weight of 1 to the stocks with the highest 10% Fear values and 0 to others.
3. **Screening Companies with the Highest Anger:**
   - You can rank the Anger values and use the  `if_else`  operator to filter out the stocks with the highest Anger values.
   - `if_else(rank(snt_social_anger) > 0.9, 1, 0)`
   This expression assigns a weight of 1 to the stocks with the highest 10% Anger values and 0 to others.

These expressions use the  `rank`  operator to rank the sentiment values and the  `if_else`  operator to apply the conditions. Adjust the threshold values (e.g., 0.1, 0.9) as needed for your specific requirements.

Hello  [LN92324](/hc/en-us/profiles/4601131163927-LN92324) ,

Thank you for your question! When dealing with skewed data distributions, consider normalizing the data or using robust statistical measures like the median or interquartile range. Additionally, combining multiple signals can help balance the overall impact.

Hello  [PM26052](/hc/en-us/profiles/16734176944407-PM26052) ,

Balancing high-turnover signals derived from vector data with more stable fundamental-driven signals can indeed improve the combined Alpha performance. Here are some recommendations:

1. **Combine Vector and Fundamental Data** : Use vector data fields to capture short-term market movements and fundamental data fields to provide stability. For example, you can use sentiment indicators from social media data (vector data) and combine them with fundamental metrics like earnings or revenue growth.
2. **Neutralization and Decay** : Apply appropriate neutralization techniques to control for market, sector, or industry risks. Use decay operators to smooth out the high turnover from vector data. For instance, using  `ts_decay`  can help reduce the impact of high-frequency noise.
3. **Weighting and Scaling** : Assign weights to the signals based on their turnover and stability. You can use the  `rank`  operator to normalize the signals and then combine them. For example:
   ```
   combined_alpha = 0.5 * rank(vector_signal) + 0.5 * rank(fundamental_signal)
   ```
4. **Trade Conditions** : Use conditional operators like  `trade_when`  to selectively apply high-turnover signals only when certain fundamental conditions are met. This can help in reducing unnecessary trades and improving stability.
5. **Risk Management** : Implement risk management techniques such as truncation and turnover limits to ensure that the combined Alpha does not exceed acceptable risk levels.

Exploring the Granger causality approach, as mentioned in the linked paper, can also be beneficial. This approach helps in identifying whether one time series can predict another, which is useful in understanding the impact of sentiment on stock prices. You can use this method to validate the predictive power of your vector signals before combining them with fundamental signals.

Hello  [AM32686](/hc/en-us/profiles/18120082104215-AM32686) ,

Combining emotional sentiment fields like 'fear' and 'anger' from the Socialmedia15 Sentiment Indicators dataset with other datasets such as volume or volatility data can indeed enhance Alpha performance by capturing sentiment-driven spikes in market activity.

### Effectiveness of vec_avg() vs. vec_max()

**vec_avg()**  and  **vec_max()**  are both useful operators for converting vector data fields into matrix data fields, but they serve different purposes:

- **vec_avg()** : This operator takes the mean of the vector field. It is effective in reducing noise and providing a stable signal by averaging out the daily variations. This can be particularly useful when you want to capture the overall sentiment trend without being affected by extreme values.
- **vec_max()** : This operator takes the maximum value from the vector field. It is useful when you want to capture the peak sentiment or the most extreme sentiment value within a day. This can be beneficial in scenarios where the highest sentiment value is more indicative of market movements.

In practice,  **vec_avg()**  is generally more effective in reducing noise while maintaining signal robustness because it smooths out the daily fluctuations and provides a more consistent signal. However,  **vec_max()**  can be useful in specific scenarios where capturing the peak sentiment is crucial.

### Cross-Region Comparisons and Region-Specific Alphas

Creating region-specific Alphas using the Socialmedia15 dataset can be advantageous due to the varying market behaviors and sentiment impacts across different regions. Here are some experiences and considerations:

- **USA** : The USA region has a larger number of fields (31 fields) and generally more data coverage, making it easier to create robust Alphas. The sentiment data in the USA can be highly correlated with market movements due to the high volume of social media activity.
- **EUR, ASI, AMR** : These regions have fewer fields compared to the USA, but they still provide valuable sentiment data. Creating region-specific Alphas in these regions can help capture local market sentiments and behaviors that might be different from the USA.
- **Cross-Region Comparisons** : When comparing Alphas across regions, it is important to consider the differences in market dynamics and sentiment impacts. Double neutralization by country before applying other groupings can help in making meaningful comparisons and improving the robustness of the Alphas.

For example, using  **vec_avg()**  to create a stable sentiment signal and combining it with volume data can help in identifying sentiment-driven spikes in market activity. Similarly, using  **vec_max()**  to capture peak sentiment values can be useful in regions where extreme sentiment values have a significant impact on market movements.

### 评论 #33 (作者: HY45205, 时间: 1年前)

Thank you for this insightful post on the Socialmedia15 dataset and its application in creating Alphas! The detailed breakdown of dataset highlights, especially regarding its regional coverage and the unique scale of its values, provides an excellent starting point for leveraging social media sentiment indicators effectively.

I found the examples showcasing the spread of data and how to interpret skewed distributions particularly helpful. The suggestion to focus on stocks with extreme sentiment scores (e.g., above or below certain thresholds) aligns well with identifying outliers that could signal unique market opportunities. The emphasis on using vector operators like  `vec_avg()`  and  `vec_sum()`  over  `vec_choose()`  also stands out as a practical approach to capturing broader social media activity trends rather than just end-of-day data.

### 评论 #34 (作者: SR82953, 时间: 1年前)

Thank you for this comprehensive and insightful overview of the Sentiment Indicators dataset! The emphasis on understanding datafield spreads, especially when dealing with skewed distributions, is incredibly useful for constructing robust Alphas. I found the guidance on vector operators, such as  **vec_avg() and vec_sum()**  **,**  particularly practical for capturing nuanced social media activity throughout the day. Additionally, your point about integrating emotional sentiment datafields like anger and fear resonates strongly, as these can provide unique perspectives on market behavior during volatile periods. Highlighting research on the correlation between negative emotions and stock performance adds depth, showcasing how sentiment-driven Alphas can be grounded in empirical findings. The dataset’s regional coverage and scalability further enhance its potential for diverse applications. This post is an invaluable resource for anyone exploring the intersection of sentiment analysis and quantitative strategies.

The **Sentiment Indicators dataset** provides valuable insights from social media, offering a unique opportunity to create **orthogonal Alphas** to diversify and strengthen your current Alpha pool. Here's an overview of the dataset and key points to consider:

### **Dataset Highlights:**

- **Coverage in Delay-1**: The dataset provides sentiment data with a 1-period lag, which means the sentiment captured may reflect market reactions with a slight delay.

- **Regional Coverage**: The dataset spans four regions, offering different fields for each:

  - **USA**: 31 fields

  - **EUR**: 13 fields

  - **ASI**: 3 fields (buzz, sentiment, emotional sentiment)

  - **AMR**: 20 fields

### **Key Considerations:**

- **Value Scaling**: The values for the datafields in this dataset are scaled to fit between a range of either **0 to 1** or **-1 to +1**. Understanding these scales is essential when creating high-quality Alphas, as improper scaling could lead to ineffective models.

- **Skewed Data**: For many data fields, the sentiment ratings and scores are **skewed towards a particular value**, meaning that sentiment could be heavily positive or negative in certain regions. This skewness must be taken into account when designing Alphas to avoid overfitting to one extreme.

By properly leveraging this dataset and ensuring careful handling of the scaling and skewness, you can generate **orthogonal Alphas** that add distinct, valuable signals to your trading strategy. This will improve the robustness of your Alpha pool and enhance your ability to capture market trends across different regions.

Hey! When using this Sentiment Indicators dataset, first, always check the data spread as mentioned. It helps understand how to use datafields better for Alphas. For vector operators, choose carefully like vec_avg(), vec_max() or vec_sum() based on your Alpha hypothesis as they affect turnover values. And don't forget stock screening using datafields like scl15_d1_anger or scl15_d1_fear. Also, reading relevant research papers gives more insights on sentiment's impact on stock prices.

Thank you for sharing the information about the Sentiment Indicators dataset. This dataset provides valuable insights from social media, which can help create orthogonal Alphas to your current pool. However, using this data requires attention to the distribution of values and selecting the right sentiment indicators, such as fear and anger, which have a strong impact on stock price movements. Applying vector operations and considering the changes in data over time can lead to more effective Alpha creation. Additionally, it's important to further research the impact of social emotions on stock markets.

The Sentiment Indicators dataset, sourced from social media, offers valuable insights to create orthogonal Alphas, enhancing the diversity of your Alpha pool. The dataset covers four regions: USA (31 fields), EUR (13 fields), ASI (3 fields), and AMR (20 fields). It provides sentiment data, including buzz, emotional sentiment, and more, with values scaled between 0-1 or -1 to +1.

To create high-quality Alphas, focus on understanding the distribution of values, as many datafields have skewed ratings. For example, selecting stocks with scores above 0.5 for the innovation score may lead to fewer selections, while those below 0.5 will show many stocks. This behavior can be leveraged to apply weights effectively using operators that account for outliers.

To maximize the dataset's potential:

- Use vector operators like  `vec_avg()` ,  `vec_max()` , and  `vec_sum()`  for analyzing social media activity over time.
- Use stock screening to identify stocks with low trust or high fear and anger scores.
- Refer to research like the study on social media sentiment's impact on stock prices, which found that negative emotions, especially fear and anger, can predict market movements, especially in times of crisis. Datafields such as  `scl15_d1_anger`  and  `scl15_d1_fear`  are crucial for this analysis.

Thank you for this detailed and insightful post! Your deep dive into the Socialmedia15 Sentiment Indicators dataset is fantastic, especially the emphasis on understanding sentiment distribution and scaling to create robust Alphas. The use of vector operators like  *vec_avg()*  and  *vec_sum()*  to capture intraday sentiment is spot on, and the idea of screening stocks by emotions such as fear and trust adds a unique edge to the analysis. Combining sentiment with metrics like turnover or volatility, as you suggested, could significantly enhance Alpha performance. Looking forward to more of your valuable insights!

Thank you for this detailed overview of the Socialmedia15 dataset. The observation regarding the skewed nature of many data fields, such as the innovation score, is particularly insightful.  Could you elaborate on the specific statistical techniques or transformations that you would recommend applying to these skewed data fields to mitigate potential biases in Alpha generation, and how might these methods differ when dealing with data skewed towards lower values versus higher values?

Thank you for sharing this comprehensive post on the Sentiment Indicators dataset! The focus on social media as a source of Alpha generation is intriguing, especially with its potential to create orthogonal signals.

A question that comes to mind is regarding the skewness in datafields like the innovation score or anger sentiment. How do you handle this skewness effectively when creating Alphas? For instance, would a transformation technique (e.g., logarithmic scaling) or outlier treatment improve signal quality? Additionally, when using vector operators such as  `vec_avg()`  or  `vec_max()` , how do you balance the trade-off between capturing intraday sentiment fluctuations and reducing noise?

Lastly, the mention of Granger causality in the referenced research paper is compelling. Could integrating lagged relationships between sentiment scores (like fear or anger) and price movements further enhance predictive power? Exploring these ideas seems like a promising direction. Thank you again for providing such valuable insights!

我想對這篇文章做些評論。首先，我非常感謝AC28031提供的社群媒體數據集的詳細介紹，這對於我們理解這些數據並創造出更好的Alpha策略有非常大的幫助。特別是對於數據的分布和尺度的解釋，以及如何使用向量運算符來捕捉每日的社群媒體活動，都非常有用。

同時，我也很佩服AC28031提供的例子，例如如何使用分數閾值來篩選股票，或者如何結合情感指標和基本面指標來創造更強大的Alpha策略。這些例子對於我們理解如何具體運用這些數據來做出更好的投資決策非常有價值。

另外，我也想對有些同學的問題做些回答。例如，如何處理權重集中的問題，可以使用group_backfill(), ts_backfill()或kth_element()運算符来確保適當的覆蓋率，並且要處理NaN或inf值，特別是在除法運算中。也可以嘗試使用group_rank(x, sector)。

還有，如何平衡高周轉信號和更穩定的基本面信號，可以結合向量數據和基本面數據，使用中和技術和衰減運算符來平滑高周轉信號，然後使用加權和尺度運算符來組合信號。同時，也可以使用交易條件運算符来選擇性地只在某些基本面條件成立的情況下應用高周轉信號，以此來減少不必要的交易，並提高穩定性。

最後，我想說，這篇文章對於我們理解社群媒體數據集和如何使用它們來創造更好的Alpha策略非常有幫助。我們應該繼續探索這些數據的潛力，並結合不同的數據和策略來創造出更強大的投資決策。
