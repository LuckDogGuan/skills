**Tips for getting started with  [Model](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets?category=model)  Datasets:**

- Model datasets have well-structured data fields that are mostly scores. You can use common time series operations like rank, z-score, or measuring the delta of the fields.
- Measuring the time series correlation as well as co-skewness can yield good signals for model data fields. For this, use the 'ts_corr' and 'ts_co_skewness' operators.
- General guidance for using the group operators on model data fields is to try the following: 'group_rank', 'group_neutralize', 'group_normalize' and 'group_zscore'.
- Neutralizations depend on the category of the model being used. For example,  [SmartRatios Model](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/model36)  give scores for different metrics related to the credit worthiness of a particular company which can vary across sectors and industries. Therefore, sector and industry neutralizations are preferred for these.
- Since model datasets may be direct or indirect predictors of returns, you can take the correlation of data fields with close price or returns to judge its potential predictive power and create Alphas.

**Example Alphas:**

1. Example Alpha Idea 1:
   - Fields based on Earnings Surprise, Earnings Growth, Cash Flow etc. tend to be highly predictive indicators of future returns. Time series analysis using 'ts_rank' or 'ts_zscore' should help in developing good Alphas. Similar to other model datasets, these data are also structured, and instead of raw values, you get scores in some form.
   - In some cases, analyzing these scores across large time periods can give insights about the trend of these scores, which can then be useful to write good Alphas.
   - In general, it is a good idea to compare these scores across smaller groups like industry or subindustry. You can use group operators like 'group_rank' or 'group_zscore' to do this.
   - Country and sector neutralizations generally work well, though we recommend you to try other groups as well
   - Since some fields of model datasets can be direct/indirect predictors of returns, you can take correlation of it with returns/close to assess its potential predictive power.
2. Example Alpha Idea 2:
   - EPS Estimate Model dataset gives EPS estimate value predicted by analysts. Time-series operators like 'ts_delta', 'ts_rank', 'ts_zscore' and 'ts_returns' can be helpful to measure the changes of the estimates and predict the stock price moving direction.
   - Using the surprise percentage fields of EPS Estimate Model dataset rather than estimate value directly can be more useful to compare companies of different sizes.
   - Scoring dataset has some well structured data fields such as scores, you can use common time series operations like 'rank', 'zscore' or measuring the delta of the fields.
   - Scoring dataset also provides some fields such as EPS growth forecast which are similar to EPS Estimate Model dataset. You can process those fields in the similar way.
   - Country and sector neutralizations generally work well, though we recommend you to try other groups as well.
   - Calculating estimate PE ratio using EPS estimates of either EPS Estimate Model dataset or Scoring dataset and price fields of basedata ( [Price Volume Data for Equity](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/pv1) ) PE ratio can be a good measurement to generate Alphas.

**Recommended Datasets:**

- [Analysts' Factor Model](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/model77)
- [Fundamentals and Technical Indicators Model](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/model109)
- [Earnings Quality](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/model25)
- [EPS Estimate Model](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/model30)
- [Analyst Revisions Model Data](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/model216)

[LI36776](/hc/en-us/profiles/12626102601111-LI36776)

I think this is an excellent hypothesis to test on the platform.

The model data available on the platform have good predictive power in many cases. But a model created by the data vendor may not have factored in all different market conditions like very high or very low volatilities during its creation. So it may be useful to test such conditions in the simulation and neutralize risks like volatility.

Great introduction to working with  **Model Datasets** ! The tips on time-series operations and group-based analysis are especially practical for quickly generating initial Alphas.

A few thoughts and questions:

1. **EPS Surprise Percentages** : Have you experimented with combining surprise fields across multiple datasets, such as the EPS Estimate Model and Scoring datasets, for cross-validated signals?
2. **Correlation Testing** : To assess predictive power, would you recommend testing correlations over rolling windows to capture changing dynamics in different market regimes?
3. **Neutralizations** : Beyond sector and industry, have you observed any success with other groups, such as style factors or geographic regions, for unique signals?

The recommendation to create a PE ratio using EPS estimates and price data is excellent—especially if paired with growth metrics like PEG ratios for nuanced Alphas. Would love to see a deeper dive into specific operators like  `ts_co_skewness`  for these datasets.

Thanks for the comprehensive guide!

Hello  [SS63636](/hc/en-us/profiles/10431327877655-SS63636) ,

Co-skewness can outperform traditional correlation analysis in generating Alphas in scenarios where the distribution of returns is not symmetric. Traditional correlation measures the linear relationship between two variables, but it does not capture higher moments of the distribution such as skewness. Co-skewness, on the other hand, measures the relationship between the returns of an asset and the squared returns of another asset, capturing asymmetries in the distribution of returns. This can be particularly useful in the following scenarios:

1. **Non-Normal Return Distributions** : In markets where asset returns exhibit significant skewness, co-skewness can provide additional insights that traditional correlation might miss. For example, in markets with frequent extreme events or "fat tails," co-skewness can help identify assets that tend to move together during these extreme events.
2. **Risk Management** : Co-skewness can be useful in risk management by identifying assets that contribute to the skewness of a portfolio's return distribution. This can help in constructing portfolios that are not only diversified in terms of variance but also in terms of higher moments, leading to better risk-adjusted returns.
3. **Event-Driven Strategies** : In event-driven strategies, where specific events (like earnings announcements or macroeconomic news) can cause asymmetric reactions in asset prices, co-skewness can help in identifying assets that are likely to react similarly to such events.

For beginners looking to maximize their learning curve, I recommend prioritizing the following datasets:

1. **Price Volume Datasets (pv1)** : These datasets are fundamental and provide essential data such as open, close, high, low prices, and trading volumes. They are a good starting point for understanding basic market dynamics and constructing simple Alphas.
2. **Fundamental Datasets** : These datasets provide financial statement data such as earnings, revenue, and balance sheet items. They are crucial for building Alphas based on fundamental analysis.
3. **Relationship Data for Equity (pv13)** : This dataset outputs various classifications and groupings of instruments based on company connections. It includes fields like  `rel_ret_comp`  (averaged one-day-return of the competing companies) and  `rel_ret_part`  (averaged one-day-return of the instrument's partners), which can be useful for understanding inter-company relationships and constructing Alphas based on these relationships.
4. **Market Microstructure Data (pv104)** : This dataset includes bid, ask, and size statistics, which can be used to construct microstructure Alphas. It adds an extra layer of analysis to price-volume data and can help in understanding the finer details of market behavior.

Hello  [AM32686](/hc/en-us/profiles/18120082104215-AM32686) ,

Combining EPS Surprise Percentages fields across multiple datasets, such as the EPS Estimate Model and Scoring datasets, can indeed be a powerful approach for generating cross-validated signals. These datasets provide various metrics that can be leveraged to enhance predictive power. For example, the EPS Estimate Model dataset includes fields like `star_eps_surprise_prediction_fq1`, `star_eps_surprise_prediction_fy1`, and `mdl30_psprise_pct_fq1_eps`, which offer predictions of EPS surprises over different time horizons. Similarly, the International Scorings Data dataset includes fields like `mdl50_bk_recent_eps_sur`, which provides the most recent quarter EPS surprise. To assess the predictive power of these combined signals, testing correlations over rolling windows is a recommended approach. This method helps capture the changing dynamics in different market regimes and can provide insights into the stability and robustness of the signals over time. Beyond sector and industry neutralizations, other groupings such as style factors or geographic regions can also be effective for generating unique signals. For instance, neutralizing by country or using custom groupings based on style factors like value, growth, or momentum can help isolate specific risks and enhance the performance of the alphas. Regarding the operator `ts_co_skewness`, it measures the co-skewness between two time series, capturing the asymmetry in their joint distribution. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where the distribution of returns is not symmetric, such as during market stress or extreme events. Using  **`ts_co_skewness`**  with EPS Surprise Percentages fields can help identify stocks that exhibit asymmetric reactions to earnings surprises, providing an additional layer of analysis beyond traditional correlation measures.

That's a great summary on momentum. From my experience, another key aspect for momentum to work is proper timing of entry and exit points. We can use technical indicators like moving averages crossover to identify when to jump in or out. Also, combining momentum with other factors in a multi-factor model can enhance its performance. And don't forget to backtest these ideas thoroughly to make sure they hold up in different market scenarios. Looking forward to next week's discussion on reversion too.

### 评论 #43 (作者: 顾问 ZH78994 (Rank 11), 时间: 1年前)

Model datasets are well-structured and typically consist of **scores** that can be leveraged using various time series operations to generate valuable trading signals. Here's how you can effectively use these datasets:

### **Key Time Series Operations:**

1. **Rank**: Assign ranks to the values over time, helping to identify relative performance.

2. **Z-Score**: Standardize the data by calculating how many standard deviations a value is from the mean, which helps in detecting outliers and anomalies.

3. **Delta**: Measure the change in values over time, useful for identifying momentum and trend shifts.

### **Advanced Signal Techniques:**

- **Time Series Correlation**: Use the **'ts_corr'** operator to assess how fields in the dataset are correlated over time. High correlation can indicate strong relationships between data fields.

- **Co-Skewness**: The **'ts_co_skewness'** operator helps measure how the dataset fields move relative to each other in terms of skewness. This can help identify non-linear relationships.

### **Group Operators**:

To further refine your approach, consider applying these group operators to the model data fields:

- **'group_rank'**: Rank the fields within groups to identify relative performance.

- **'group_neutralize'**: Neutralize any biases or confounding factors within the groups to ensure more accurate signals.

- **'group_normalize'**: Normalize the fields to bring them to a consistent scale within each group.

- **'group_zscore'**: Apply z-score normalization to standardize the values across groups.

By combining these techniques, you can generate **robust signals** from model data fields, improving the accuracy and reliability of your trading strategies.

When working with  **Model Datasets** , which typically consist of structured data fields like scores, there are several effective approaches and techniques to generate Alpha strategies. These datasets often include predictive factors for stock performance, such as earnings growth, EPS estimates, and other financial metrics. Below are some essential tips and ideas for getting started:

### Key Tips for Getting Started:

1. **Use Time Series Operations** :
   - Common operations like  **rank** ,  **z-score** , and  **delta**  are useful for analyzing model data fields.
   - For example, the  **ts_rank**  operation helps rank a field over time, while  **ts_zscore**  standardizes it, and  **ts_delta**  measures changes.
2. **Correlation and Co-Skewness** :
   - Measure the correlation between model fields and stock prices or returns using  **ts_corr** .
   - **ts_co_skewness**  can also be useful for assessing asymmetries in the relationships between model data and market behavior, potentially identifying high-potential signals.
3. **Group Operations** :
   - Group-based analysis is key. Use operators like  **group_rank** ,  **group_neutralize** ,  **group_normalize** , and  **group_zscore**  to compare model data across groups.
   - **Neutralization**  should be done based on the category of the model. For example,  **sector**  and  **industry neutralization**  are crucial for models like the  **SmartRatios Model** , which may differ across these categories.
4. **Neutralizations and Categories** :
   - **Sector and industry neutralizations**  are particularly important for models related to credit-worthiness, earnings, or growth metrics.
   - Consider using  **country**  and  **sector**  as neutralization groups to refine predictions and control for external market factors.
5. **Predictive Power** :
   - Since model datasets can be direct or indirect predictors of returns, evaluating the correlation between data fields and returns (or closing prices) is crucial for identifying predictive power.
   - By assessing how closely these fields align with stock price movements, you can identify effective Alpha signals.

### Example Alpha Ideas:

#### Example 1: Earnings Surprise, Growth, and Cash Flow

- **Earnings Surprise, Earnings Growth** , and  **Cash Flow**  are often highly predictive of future returns.
  - Time series analysis using  **ts_rank**  or  **ts_zscore**  can help identify trends in these fields over time.
  - **Group analysis**  (using  **group_rank**  or  **group_zscore** ) can be applied to compare these scores within smaller groups like  **industry**  or  **subindustry** .
  - **Country and sector neutralization**  is generally effective, but experimenting with other groupings may yield better results.

#### Example 2: EPS Estimate Models

- **EPS Estimates**  from analysts predict earnings for companies. Time-series operations such as  **ts_delta** ,  **ts_rank** , and  **ts_zscore**  are helpful for tracking changes in these estimates.
  - Use the  **surprise percentage fields**  in the  **EPS Estimate Model**  to compare companies of different sizes. This is often more insightful than using the raw estimate values.
  - **Scoring datasets**  (like EPS growth forecasts) can also be analyzed similarly, using  **time series**  operations and  **group-based neutralizations** .

#### Example 3: Price-to-Earnings (PE) Ratio Alpha

- Calculate the  **PE ratio**  using  **EPS estimates**  from datasets like the  **EPS Estimate Model**  or  **Scoring Dataset** , along with the stock’s price data.
  - The PE ratio can be an effective measure for generating Alphas based on relative valuation and expected stock returns.

### Recommended Datasets:

1. **Analysts' Factor Model** : Contains analyst ratings and recommendations, offering insights into expected stock performance.
2. **Fundamentals and Technical Indicators Model** : Focuses on financial metrics, combining fundamental and technical data.
3. **Earnings Quality** : Tracks metrics related to the quality and sustainability of earnings, providing predictive value for stock performance.
4. **EPS Estimate Model** : Provides earnings per share estimates from analysts, which can be leveraged for forecasting stock price movements.
5. **Analyst Revisions Model** : Tracks changes in analyst recommendations, offering a signal of stock potential based on updated forecasts.

By carefully applying time series and group operators, along with neutralizations, you can develop effective Alphas using model datasets. Experiment with various combinations of techniques, and always assess the predictive power of each signal to create more robust strategies.

Model datasets are often well-structured with data fields that are mostly represented as scores, making them ideal for various time series operations. You can apply techniques like  **rank** ,  **z-score** , or measure the  **delta**  of these fields to extract meaningful insights. Additionally, measuring  **time series correlation**  and  **co-skewness**  can yield valuable signals, and operators such as  **`ts_corr`**  and  **`ts_co_skewness`**  are useful for this analysis. When working with these model datasets, it’s also recommended to use group operators like  **`group_rank`** ,  **`group_neutralize`** ,  **`group_normalize`** , and  **`group_zscore`** . These operators help refine and standardize scores while accounting for group effects, such as sector, industry, or region differences. Neutralizations depend on the specific model being used; for example, a  **SmartRatios Model**  scoring creditworthiness across various companies will require sector and industry neutralizations, as credit risk varies across sectors. Since model datasets can serve as direct or indirect predictors of returns, you can assess their predictive power by calculating their correlation with  **close prices**  or  **returns** . If a data field, such as credit risk, shows a strong negative correlation with stock returns, it might indicate strong potential for generating Alphas. For instance, applying neutralization techniques to the  **debt-to-equity ratio**  of tech stocks and correlating the results with  **1-month returns**  could reveal insights that lead to profitable Alpha creation. By leveraging these methods, model datasets become a powerful tool for creating actionable and predictive trading signals.

Thank you for sharing this insightful guide on working with model datasets! The structured approach and practical tips, such as leveraging time-series and group operators, provide a strong foundation for Alpha generation.

One question I have relates to using sector and industry neutralizations. When applying these techniques to datasets like the SmartRatios Model, how do you balance the need for broader neutralizations (e.g., region or country) against the granularity of sector-based adjustments? Additionally, when combining fields like EPS growth forecast and PE ratio, have you observed any challenges with data alignment across different datasets, such as differences in reporting frequency?

The idea of using surprise percentage fields in EPS Estimate Models is particularly intriguing. Could combining these fields with sentiment indicators or technical trends enhance predictive power further?

Looking forward to testing some of these recommendations—thank you again for the detailed notes!

### 评论 #89 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 1年前)

You're absolutely right—certain market conditions, such as high or low volatility, can affect the predictive power of model data fields like price or returns. In periods of high volatility, correlations may fluctuate, and models that rely on stable, long-term trends might see reduced accuracy. On the other hand, during periods of low volatility, predictive signals might be more stable, but the risk of overfitting to market noise increases. Understanding how market regimes impact these correlations can help fine-tune your models for different conditions.

**Regarding model datasets for sentiment or macroeconomic factors** , here are some ideas:

1. **Market Sentiment Datasets** :
   - **News sentiment** : Sentiment analysis from news articles or social media posts can help gauge market sentiment in real-time, affecting short-term price movements.
   - **Investor sentiment indices** : Datasets like the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) sentiment survey can be useful for capturing sentiment shifts.
2. **Macroeconomic Datasets** :
   - **Interest rates and yield curves** : Yield curve data (especially the spread between 10-year and 2-year treasuries) can be highly predictive for future returns and economic conditions.
   - **Inflation data** : Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) can give insights into inflation trends, which are crucial for macroeconomic models.
   - **Economic indicators** : Datasets like GDP growth, unemployment rates, and retail sales figures provide a big-picture view that can be integrated with market-specific signals.

Incorporating these datasets can add more layers of prediction, especially when combined with traditional market data. For example, combining sentiment analysis with macroeconomic indicators could refine predictions during times of market uncertainty or geopolitical events.

This post provides an excellent roadmap for leveraging  **model datasets**  to develop Alphas, particularly by applying  **time series operations, correlation analysis, and group-based normalizations** . The structured nature of these datasets—where fields are often  **scores rather than raw values** —makes them well-suited for transformations like  **ranking, z-scoring, and delta calculations** .

One particularly effective approach is using  **'ts_corr' and 'ts_co_skewness'**  to measure  **time-series relationships and asymmetries**  within model data fields, potentially revealing predictive signals. Additionally, the application of  **group operators**  like  **'group_rank', 'group_zscore', and 'group_neutralize'**  ensures that Alpha signals remain relevant within specific market segments, especially for datasets like  **SmartRatios Model** , where sector and industry adjustments help normalize creditworthiness-related metrics.

The  **EPS Estimate Model dataset**  is a standout, as  **changes in analyst estimates**  can be leading indicators of price movement. Operators like  **'ts_delta', 'ts_rank', and 'ts_returns'**  can capture these shifts dynamically. Using  **surprise percentage fields**  rather than raw estimates is a smart way to standardize signals across companies of different sizes. Additionally, calculating  **estimated PE ratios**  using  **EPS estimates and price data**  can offer insights into valuation-based Alpha generation.

A key takeaway is that  **model datasets may serve as direct or indirect return predictors** , making it crucial to assess their  **historical correlation with price movements**  before finalizing Alpha strategies. Looking forward to exploring further applications across datasets like  **Analysts’ Factor Model, Earnings Quality, and Analyst Revisions Model Data**  to refine predictive performance!

This is a great summary of how to leverage  **Model Datasets**  for generating  **Alphas** . Here are some additional insights and potential enhancements based on financial theory and quantitative research:

### **Key Takeaways from Model Datasets for Alpha Generation:**

1. **Time Series Operations Are Crucial:**
   - Operators like  **`ts_rank`** ,  **`ts_zscore`** ,  **`ts_corr`** , and  **`ts_co_skewness`**  help extract meaningful trends.
   - Looking at  **changes over time**  (delta, returns) can highlight momentum and reversion patterns.
2. **Group Operators for Relative Ranking:**
   - Using  **`group_rank`** ,  **`group_neutralize`** , and  **`group_zscore`**  helps standardize signals within industry/sector/country.
   - **Why?**  Industries and countries have  **different risk premiums and valuation levels** —neutralizing ensures signals are  **comparable** .
3. **Correlation with Returns for Predictive Power:**
   - Directly measuring  **the correlation of model dataset fields with stock returns**  helps determine signal strength.
   - Some data fields  **(earnings surprise, EPS growth, cash flow metrics)**  are well-known  **leading indicators**  of price movements.

### **Enhancing Alpha Ideas with Financial Insights**

#### 🔹  **Earnings Surprise & Growth (Example Alpha 1)**

- Earnings growth and cash flow are  **fundamental drivers of stock performance** .
- **Momentum effect** : Stocks with  **positive earnings surprises**  tend to continue their trend.
- **Mean reversion** : Excessive reactions to earnings reports may correct over time.

✅  **Enhancement:** 
Use  **`ts_returns(earnings_surprise_score, 10)`**  to track how a stock reacts post-earnings and trade accordingly.

#### 🔹  **EPS Estimate Model Dataset (Example Alpha 2)**

- Analysts' EPS estimates  **often lag behind market expectations**  but still hold valuable information.
- **Revisions to estimates**  drive  **institutional flows**  and impact stock prices.

✅  **Enhancement:** 
Use  **EPS growth vs. Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio**  to find underpriced growth stocks:

- `PE_ratio = close / EPS_estimate`
- **Screen for** : Low PE but high EPS growth →  **Value + Growth Alpha**

### **Additional Alpha Ideas Using Recommended Datasets**

🔹  **Analysts' Factor Model**

- Track  **upward/downward revision trends**  using  `ts_delta(analyst_revisions, 20)` .
- High revisions  **+ strong earnings quality = high-confidence alpha** .

🔹  **Fundamentals & Technical Indicators Model**

- Combine  **fundamental strength + technical momentum**  for  **multi-factor alphas** .
- Example: Rank stocks based on  **EPS growth + RSI momentum** .

🔹  **Earnings Quality**

- Companies with  **high earnings quality (low accruals, strong free cash flow)**  tend to  **outperform** .
- Create an alpha using  **earnings_quality_score**  combined with  **ROE** .

### **Conclusion**

Using  **Model Datasets**  effectively requires combining: ✅  **Time series transformations**  (for trends & momentum)
✅  **Relative rankings**  (for cross-sectional insights)
✅  **Fundamental intuition**  (for predictive power)

By blending financial logic with structured  **quantitative methods** , you can create  **robust, data-driven Alphas**  that persist in real-world markets. 🚀

This post provides an excellent foundation for leveraging model datasets in Alpha generation. Using  **ts_corr**  and  **ts_co_skewness**  to measure relationships with returns can uncover meaningful predictive signals. The emphasis on  **sector and industry neutralization**  for datasets like SmartRatios ensures that Alpha signals are not driven by structural differences across industries. Additionally, applying  **ts_delta**  and  **ts_rank**  to  **EPS estimate surprises**  could be a robust approach to identifying earnings-driven price movements. Another interesting idea is using  **rolling correlations**  between model fields and price returns to detect regime shifts in predictive power. Excited to explore these techniques further—great insights!

Thanks for sharing these valuable insights! I hadn’t considered using co-skewness ( `ts_co_skewness` ) for model data fields before—definitely an interesting approach. Also, the idea of comparing EPS estimate surprise percentages instead of raw estimates makes a lot of sense for handling company size differences. The recommendations on neutralization strategies and dataset selection are really helpful too. Looking forward to testing some of these ideas!
