When the stock price starts to diverge from the moving averages or fails to follow the longer-term trend, this might signal a lack of a clear trend, and investors may decide to stay out of the market. This could indicate either a trend reversal or a period of consolidation, which is typically less favorable for trend-following strategies.

In my view, optimizing performance requires maximizing returns and margins to the highest feasible threshold while minimizing drawdowns, which will significantly enhance overall efficiency.

This technique involves capping extreme values to a certain percentile (e.g., 1st and 99th percentiles). By doing so, you ensure that outliers don’t unduly affect your analysis. This is particularly useful when you want to limit the impact of outliers without changing the distribution too much.

- A higher R^2 suggests the stock's short-term trend aligns with the long-term trend.
- **Weakness** : If the stock is trending downward, R^2 might still be high but could signal a downtrend rather than an uptrend.

Strategies used when a trader expects significant price movement in either direction but is unsure of the direction. A straddle involves buying both a call and put option at the same strike price, while a strangle uses different strike prices for the call and put.

In an ideal strategy:

- **Returns**  should grow steadily to boost profits.
- **Drawdowns**  should stay low to manage risk and avoid big losses.
- **Margin**  should be used smartly—enough to enhance returns but not so much that it increases vulnerability.

It’s all about finding the right balance: aiming for strong returns while keeping risk in check and using resources wisely.

This method limits extreme values to a specific percentile range (e.g., 1st and 99th percentiles), preventing outliers from skewing the analysis. It helps control the influence of outliers while preserving the overall distribution.

An optimal trading strategy maximizes returns while keeping drawdown and margin usage controlled. Returns should increase, but drawdown must remain proportionate to prevent excessive losses. Margin should be efficiently used to enhance profitability without risking liquidation. The key is balancing risk and reward for sustainable, risk-adjusted profitability over time.

### 评论 #9 (作者: YB19132, 时间: 1年前)

While high returns are desirable, excessive returns in short timeframes can sometimes indicate overfitting or excessive risk-taking. A more stable approach is to prioritize consistency over short bursts of high performance.

### 评论 #10 (作者: SK72105, 时间: 1年前)

I think the Performance comparison metrics that you should aim for in most regions (GLB,USA,ASI,EUR,AMR) is : sharpe > 10, turnover < 17.5, margin > 8, drawdown < 0.5 (drawdown is hard to achieve in AMR but others its quite possible)

However the strategy to get there and the number of alphas you want to submit to get there depends on several factors. Having a high sharpe, margin, and a low drawdown will likely improve your overall combined performance.

Hi  [CS12450](/hc/en-us/profiles/26663429754391-CS12450) ,
Before submitting an alpha, it’s good practice to check performance comparisons. An optimal strategy should exhibit:

- **Higher Sharpe Ratio**  (better risk-adjusted returns)
- **Higher Fitness Score**  (stronger overall strategy performance)
- **Higher Returns**  (greater profitability)
- **Higher Margin Utilization**  (efficient use of capital)
- **Lower Turnover**  (reducing trading costs and slippage)
- **Lower Drawdown**  (limiting peak-to-trough losses)

Returns and margin should increase, but not at the expense of excessive drawdown, ensuring a stable and sustainable alpha.

### 评论 #12 (作者: 顾问 DM28368 (Rank 60), 时间: 1年前)

In my opinion, alpha should have low turnover and high margin with low volatility. It will be difficult to harmonize, so I can only adjust the alpha to the best at the present time.

### 评论 #13 (作者: RB98150, 时间: 1年前)

An optimal strategy aims for  **higher returns** ,  **lower drawdowns** , and  **efficient margin use** . Returns should be stable with a high Sharpe ratio, while drawdowns must be minimized to reduce risk. Margin should be optimized, avoiding excessive leverage. Balancing these ensures strong, risk-adjusted profitability

### 评论 #14 (作者: NL78692, 时间: 1年前)

You can adjust the metrics by increasing the Decay rate in the settings. This way, metrics such as Turnover will decrease, while Margin and Return may increase. As a result, your alpha will achieve a better

### 评论 #15 (作者: HN71281, 时间: 1年前)

An optimal strategy balances  **high returns, low drawdowns, and efficient margin use** . Reducing drawdowns minimizes risk, while smart margin management prevents overleveraging. The goal is  **consistent profitability with controlled risk**  for long-term success.

### 评论 #16 (作者: CM45657, 时间: 1年前)

In an optimal strategy,  **Returns** ,  **Drawdown** , and  **Margin**  should behave in a balanced way to maximize profitability while controlling risk. Here’s how they should ideally interact:

### 1.  **Returns (Increase)**

- The goal is to maximize risk-adjusted returns, not just absolute returns. High returns are desirable, but they must be consistent and sustainable.
- Excessive returns often indicate high risk, so it's essential to evaluate them alongside volatility and drawdown.

### 2.  **Drawdown (Decrease)**

- Drawdown measures the peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value. Lower drawdowns indicate better risk management and smoother equity curves.
- An optimal strategy aims to minimize maximum drawdown while maintaining healthy returns, ensuring capital preservation during downturns.

### 3.  **Margin (Efficient Use, Not Excessive)**

- Margin usage should be efficient, not excessive. High leverage can amplify returns but also increases drawdown risk.
- An optimal strategy maintains a balance where margin utilization supports profitability without exposing the portfolio to margin calls.

### **Balancing Profitability and Risk**

- **Sharpe Ratio**  and  **Information Ratio (IR)** : High returns with controlled drawdowns lead to better risk-adjusted performance.
- **Calmar Ratio** : Higher returns relative to maximum drawdown indicate a more resilient strategy.
- **Efficient Frontier** : The goal is to position the strategy on the efficient frontier, where the highest return is achieved for a given level of risk.

From my point of view, we optimize by trying to increase Sharpe ratio, Fitness score as much as we can. For Drawdown, we should try to decrease it (by decreasing drawdown, the Fitness score will be higher and therefore, Sharpe ratio will also be higher too, as the PnL chart will be flatter). For turnover and margin, I try to balance it (not too high or too low), because turnover reflect the trading frequency of your alphas, if you trade too much, the fee will be a lot, but if you trade too little, then it also seems that you are passive compared to market volatility. Also with margins, it reflects the efficiency of capital using, it two sides of the coin, with too high leverage, your capital will be put in risk.

In an optimal strategy, the goal is to maximize returns while minimizing drawdown and carefully managing margin usage to balance profitability and risk. Returns should increase, reflecting the strategy’s ability to consistently generate profits from market opportunities. At the same time, drawdowns—or the declines from peak portfolio values—should decrease, as lower drawdowns indicate better capital preservation and resilience during market downturns. Margin, which is used to leverage positions and potentially enhance returns, must be optimized rather than maximized; excessive margin can amplify losses and increase drawdowns, while too little may limit the strategy's ability to capture gains.

### 评论 #19 (作者: 顾问 CH36668 (Rank 76), 时间: 1年前)

An optimal strategy boosts returns while managing drawdown and margin. Returns should grow without excessive losses, and margin must be used efficiently to avoid liquidation. The goal is sustainable, risk-adjusted profitability.

### 评论 #20 (作者: RG93974, 时间: 1年前)

Margin should be used efficiently to increase profitability without the risk of liquidation. Along with margin, it reflects the efficiency of capital use, two sides of the coin, with too much leverage, your capital will be put at risk. This is especially useful when you want to limit the effect of outliers without changing the distribution too much.

This is a fascinating topic! It's crucial to understand how Returns, Drawdown, and Margin interplay in crafting a solid strategy. Maintaining a balance is key; ideally, Returns should increase while keeping Drawdown and Margin in check to ensure risk is managed effectively. I would love to see more examples or theoretical models to illustrate this interaction!

### 评论 #27 (作者: MB13430, 时间: 1年前)

If you can maintain the same level of returns in alpha while reducing turnover, your profitability, margin, and overall score will improve.

### 评论 #28 (作者: FM59649, 时间: 1年前)

I believe the returns should be high and the drawdowns as low as possible, The ratio of returns to drawdowns should be at least greater than 2. You should also focus on having a high margin.

Many have pointed out the importance of balancing returns, drawdowns, and margin use. One way to quantify this is through the  **Sortino Ratio** , which focuses on downside risk rather than total volatility like the Sharpe Ratio. A higher Sortino Ratio indicates that a strategy is effectively generating returns while minimizing harmful drawdowns.

*By reducing turnover while maintaining your alpha, you can significantly enhance the  **profitability** ,  **margin** , and  **overall score**  of your strategy. Lower turnover reduces  **transaction costs** , improves  **capital efficiency** , and minimizes  **market impact.***

When a stock price begins to move away from its moving averages or fails to follow the long-term trend, it can indicate a lack of clear direction, prompting investors to stay out of the market. This may suggest either a potential trend reversal or a period of consolidation, both of which are usually less favorable for trend-following strategies. To refine your analysis, you can cap extreme values at specific percentiles (like the 1st and 99th percentiles) to prevent outliers from skewing your data. This ensures that these extremes do not unduly influence your findings while maintaining the integrity of the overall distribution. An effective strategy focuses on steady returns, controlled drawdowns, and smart use of margin. The key is finding a balance between enhancing profits, managing risks, and using resources wisely.

How do you adjust your strategy when a trend shows signs of reversing or entering consolidation phases?

### **Optimal Behavior of Returns, Drawdown, and Margin in a Trading Strategy**

An ideal trading strategy aims to  **maximize returns**  while  **minimizing risk**  and  **efficiently utilizing margin** . The key trade-offs involve balancing profitability (returns) with risk exposure (drawdowns and margin usage).

#### **1. Returns (Should Increase)**

- Higher returns indicate a profitable strategy.
- However, excessive returns in short timeframes can signal overfitting or excessive risk-taking.
- The goal is to generate  **consistent and sustainable**  returns over time.

#### **2. Drawdown (Should Decrease)**

- Drawdown measures the  **maximum peak-to-trough loss**  of the strategy.
- A  **lower drawdown**  suggests better risk management and  **smoother equity growth** .
- Strategies with  **high returns but deep drawdowns**  can be dangerous, as they risk large capital losses during market downturns.

#### **3. Margin (Should Be Used Efficiently)**

- **Margin enhances returns**  by leveraging capital, but excessive margin increases risk.
- If too much margin is used,  **liquidation risks**  rise, which can wipe out profits.
- The best approach is to  **optimize margin**  rather than maximize it, ensuring leverage is used in a  **controlled manner** .

### **Balancing Profitability and Risk**

- **Sharpe Ratio**  (Higher is better): Measures return per unit of risk.
- **Calmar Ratio**  (Higher is better): Return relative to maximum drawdown.
- **Turnover**  (Lower is better): High turnover increases trading costs and slippage.

### **Conclusion**

An optimal strategy aims for  **higher returns** ,  **lower drawdowns** , and  **smart margin usage** . A well-balanced approach ensures  **sustainable, risk-adjusted profitability**  without excessive exposure to downside risks. 🚀

This is a great discussion point on optimizing trading strategies. Ideally,  **returns**  should increase while  **drawdown**  and  **margin usage**  remain controlled. A well-balanced strategy maximizes profitability (higher returns) while keeping risk in check (lower drawdown). Excessive margin usage can amplify gains but also expose the strategy to higher risk, so maintaining an efficient risk-return trade-off is crucial. Thanks for sharing this!
