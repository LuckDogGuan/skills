**Paper:**  The Risk in Hedge Fund Strategies: Theory and Evidence from Trend Followers

**Author(s):**  William Fung and David A. Hsieh

**Alpha idea:**

**The Fung-Hsieh 7-factor model**  is a risk factor model commonly used to evaluate hedge funds' performance. The seven factors are risk factors that explain a large proportion of the returns of hedge funds. The aim of the factors is to capture the returns to a well-diversified portfolio of hedge funds.

The 7 factor model for hedge funds is actually a simple linear factor model, similar to the Fama and French 3 factor model for individual stocks. In this case, however, the model is used to explain hedge fund returns.

The model uses the following 7 factors:

1. **Bond Trend-Following Factor:** Tracking and trading bonds based on their price movements over time.
2. **Currency Trend-Following Factor:**  Monitoring and trading currencies by identifying and capitalizing on their price trends.
3. **Commodity Trend-Following Factor:** Observing and trading commodities like metals and agricultural products, focusing on their price trends to make investment decisions.
4. **Equity Market Factor (Equity-Oriented):** This factor is based on the overall performance of the stock market, typically represented by an index such as the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500). It measures the general movement and returns of the broader equity market over time.
5. **Size Spread Factor (Equity-Oriented):**  This factor compares the performance of small-cap stocks to large-cap stocks. It measures the difference in returns between a small-cap index (such as the Russell 2000) and a large-cap index (such as the S&P 500), providing insight into the relative performance of smaller versus larger companies in the equity market.
6. **Bond Market Factor (Bond Oriented):**  This factor measures the monthly change in the yield of 10-year Treasury bonds. It provides insight into the overall movement of interest rates in the bond market, which can affect bond prices and returns.
7. **Credit Spread Factor (Bond-Oriented):**  This factor quantifies the monthly change in the spread between the yields of Moody's Baa-rated corporate bonds and 10-year Treasury bonds. It reflects changes in the perceived credit risk of corporate bonds relative to government bonds and can indicate market sentiment towards creditworthiness and economic conditions.

Once we have the factors, the model looks as follows:


> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> Q0 + BiPTFSBt +
> BzPTFScurt + BgPTFScomt + BuEQt+
> BsESt + BoBMI + B7BSt + Et


Where PTFS are the trend following factors for Bonds, Currencies, and Commodities, EQ is the equity factor, ES is the Equity Size factor, BM is the bond market, and BS is the Bond Size factor.

**Fung - Hsieh 8 factor model**

A few years after the introduction of the 7 factor model, Fung and Hsieh added an eighth factor. This model is referred to as the Fung-Hsieh 8 factor model. The additional factor that is added to the model is the MSCI Emerging Market Index

- **Emerging Market Risk Factor:**  The Emerging Market Risk Factor represents the exposure to risks associated with investing in emerging markets. These risks can include political instability, currency fluctuations, regulatory changes, and less-developed market infrastructures. Investors often demand higher returns to compensate for these additional risks when investing in emerging markets compared to developed markets.

This is the workhorse model when researchers try to explain hedge funds return and analyze whether hedge funds generate alpha. Hints: You can start from the CAPM example on Brain, then develop according to upgraded variants (FF3, FF5, ...)

**Discussion question:** It seems that factor models (variants of CAPM) generally perform better in the US market. According to my observations, factors with low correlation to each other will create better signals. Besides, will adding too many factors to the linear model cause the alpha to be overfitting?

Look forward to discussing with researchers and classmates. Thank you very much.

Can you give an idea how to make an alpha on this? I tried using the given data fields to make alphas but failed. Thanks!

Hey! You've got some good points there. Yeah, factor models often do perform better in the US market due to its liquidity and data availability. Regarding low correlation factors creating better signals, that's quite right as they can capture different aspects of the market. And about adding too many factors in a linear model, it can lead to overfitting indeed. When there're excessive factors, the model might fit the noise in the training data rather than the true underlying patterns, reducing its out-of-sample performance. So, gotta be careful with factor selection and model complexity.

The Fung-Hsieh 7-factor model offers a comprehensive approach to evaluating hedge fund performance by incorporating diverse risk factors across various asset classes. The addition of the emerging market risk factor in the 8-factor model adds further depth, reflecting the unique challenges and opportunities in these markets. It's interesting to consider how correlation between factors can influence model accuracy and how overfitting might impact alpha generation. Balancing the number of factors and their correlations seems key to ensuring robust and generalizable models. Would be curious to hear more on how dynamic factor weighting might improve model performance in practice!

That's a lot of factors.
