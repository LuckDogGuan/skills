Not really sure what you mean here. These operators are quite different in their meaning, and have different use-cases.

Please refer to the "Learn" section to gain a clear understanding of the meaning and application of both operators. It is not possible for anyone to recommend a single operator that works best for all regions, as operators are chosen based on the **specific idea** or  **hypothesis**  being tested, not the other way around.

If your question is about which data then I think 1 variable should be return, and the other variable you should test different data sets

This operator is best used when you need to analyze the changes in a time series over time. For example, it’s useful in analyzing the daily price changes of a stock, the rate of return in financial data, or any dataset where the changes between consecutive observations matter.

The choice between the operators  **`ts_delta`**  and  **`ts_corr`**  depends on the specific goal and context of your analysis, as they serve different purposes. Both are useful tools for time-series analysis, but each operator has distinct characteristics.

No one can propose a single strategy that works in all cases, as strategies are chosen based on the specific idea or hypothesis being tested, not the other way around. For example, in football, a coach selects tactics that align with the opponent and available squad, such as counter-attacking or high-pressing, rather than sticking to a fixed strategy for every match. Similarly, in finance, you choose an investment approach that suits market conditions and your goals, such as focusing on growth stocks in a bullish market or shifting to bonds during times of uncertainty

The choice between the  `ts_delta`  and  `ts_corr`  operators depends on the specific objectives and context of your analysis, as they serve different purposes.  The  `ts_delta`  operator can be viewed as performing a first-order differentiation, while  `ts_corr`  calculates the correlation between two entities.

When choosing between  `ts_delta`  and  `ts_corr` , I think the best operator depends on your objective:

- **Use  `ts_delta`**  if you're focusing on momentum or reversion. It measures the change over time and is ideal for detecting price trends or short-term reversals.
- **Use  `ts_corr`**  if you're analyzing relationships between two time series. It's effective for spotting patterns like co-movement or divergence between variables (e.g., volume and price).

For broader applicability:

- **Combine both**  for enriched signals:  `ts_corr`  to identify relationships and  `ts_delta`  to capture directional shifts.
- Test each operator in different regions to see which consistently adds value in your specific context.

Fine-tune based on backtesting results and domain-specific data behavior.

**`ts_delta`** : Typically used to calculate the difference (delta) between time-series values, providing insight into how values are changing over time. It’s useful for detecting sudden shifts or changes in data.

The comparison between ts_delta and ts_corr as operators for time series analysis is intriguing! Each operator likely has its strengths depending on the context. It would be interesting to explore what specific factors or scenarios you think make one better than the other in certain regions. Could you share more insights on this?
