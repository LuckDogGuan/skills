To control high turnover while maintaining returns in price-volume strategies, My approach is to extend holding periods and use smoothing techniques to reduce trade frequency. Incorporating transaction cost analysis ensures trades are cost-effective. Stabilizing signals through  **`ts_decay_linear()`** and trend confirmation minimizes noise.

Setting  **higher signal thresholds and minimum holding periods**  aids selective trading. I optimize risk with Sharpe ratio, scale positions by volatility, and blend time horizons. Realistic backtesting, including market impact and liquidity constraints, refines strategy performance. Regularization  prevents model over-sensitivity, and aggregating signals ensures reliable trade decisions.

What are your thoughts or strategies for managing high turnover while maintaining good returns?

I think it’s a solid approach! You can further enhance it by using  **vec_choose**  for selecting stable signals,  **ts_corr**  to validate trends with correlated indicators, and  **neutralize**  to isolate pure alpha from systemic effects

I often use the ts_mean, ts_max, ts_min functions to reduce turnover and I find them quite effective in reducing turnover of price volume data.

Managing high turnover is always a trade-off between maintaining agility to capture market opportunities and avoiding excessive costs or noise. Your emphasis on realistic backtesting and the use of smoothing techniques strikes a balance between responsiveness and stability. Strategies like signal aggregation and blending time horizons ensure a holistic approach to handling diverse market dynamics.

I think the most effective way to reduce turnover is to add conditions in trade when or if else, like setting a limit to only trade when volume is less than average volume in 1 month

Your strategy for managing high turnover while maintaining returns is well-rounded, especially with the use of smoothing techniques and extended holding periods. I think incorporating transaction cost analysis is key, as it helps ensure your trades remain cost-effective. Additionally, adjusting signal thresholds based on market conditions can add flexibility to your approach, allowing you to reduce turnover during volatile periods without missing out on potential returns. It's also great to see you're considering Sharpe ratio optimization and regularization to prevent overfitting. Looking forward to hearing more about how these methods work in practice!

- **Your Approach** : Using techniques like  `ts_decay_linear()`  for signal smoothing is an effective way to reduce market noise and improve the  **signal-to-noise ratio** . This helps in identifying more reliable trends, especially in volatile markets where noise can create false signals.
- **Additional Thought** : You can also consider using  **exponential moving averages (EMA)**  or  **simple moving averages (SMA)**  to smooth signals over different time periods. This can make signals more robust and less prone to sudden fluctuations, especially in high-frequency strategies.

Are there any specific operators I should use to achieve this? I apologize for my inexperience, but I'm interested in participating in HCAC and would greatly appreciate any assistance. Thank you in advance!

Liquidity and market impact analysis aims to reduce slippage costs and avoid trading in low-liquidity assets. Additionally, out-of-sample testing ensures signal robustness and effectiveness across different market conditions

The idea is solid, but the Alpha’s technical construction might need more work. In this case, try the methods mentioned earlier, and add these steps:

Make sure your template includes data handling practices that ensure proper coverage, limit outliers, and smooth out the data. Missing initial or extra ts_backfill data can cause Alpha values to drop and lead to unnecessary turnover. You can clamp, winsorize, or truncate the data to remove outliers. Ranking the data, applying decay, or adjusting the mean beforehand can help reduce turnover and keep the Sharpe ratio intact. These techniques can be applied before and after creating the main Alpha signal. For example, use ts_backfill and rank the raw data right from the start. Other methods like trade_when, decay, hump, and ts_target_tvr_delta_limit are helpful too. I recommend standardizing or scaling the signal first (using rank, quantile, scale_down, or group_normalize) before applying the operators, and limiting the operators’ arguments to avoid absolute values.

Strategies that are too volatile may have great short-term performance but fail to sustain over the long run. A well-balanced strategy, combining these factors, can lead to more stable and consistent returns.

Your approach to managing high turnover with extended holding periods and smoothing techniques is quite insightful. I particularly appreciate how you incorporate transaction cost analysis and consider market impact in your strategies. Have you also explored methods for incorporating machine learning to further enhance signal reliability? It might add another layer to your already robust framework.
