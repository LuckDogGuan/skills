To increase your combined alpha performance and combined selected alpha performance, focus on improving the signal quality and reducing correlation among alphas. Use operators like  `decay_linear` ,  `rank` ,  `ts_zscore` , and  `ts_corr`  to extract stronger, more stable signals. Datasets such as  `returns` ,  `volume` ,  `vwap` , and  `industry-neutralized metrics`  often help improve robustness. To keep both metrics above 1, ensure high fitness scores, low turnover, and diversify across uncorrelated, consistently performing alphas.

You should keep the alpha’s turnover at a stable level between 10–30%. Additionally, alphas should demonstrate good out-of-sample (OS) performance through backtesting and show practical trading feasibility — for example, a very high short/long ratio is often a negative sign, even if the alpha’s performance looks impressive.

[AS77213](/hc/en-us/profiles/10752416693655-AS77213)  Make alphas using diverse data fields and diverse operators. Have sound logic in your idea, and keep it simple. Don't add multiple ideas in a single alpha just to make it submittable. Read papers. There is a lot of information available online on which to make alphas.

Friend, **Combined Alpha Performance** measures the overall out-of-sample (OS) performance of all the alphas you submitted. **Combined Selected Alpha Performance** measures the OS performance of the alphas selected by the platform.

To maintain strong results:  

1. **Consistently submit high-quality alphas**;  

2. Ensure **stable quality across all regions** where you submit alphas — performance is calculated with **equal weighting per region**;  

3. **Balance quality across regions** to achieve equilibrium.

To increase  **Combined Alpha Performance**  and  **Combined Selected Alpha Performance** :

✅  **Operators to use:**

- `combo_a` : Combines multiple strong alphas with diversification.
- `rank` ,  `group_rank` : Helps sharpen signal across groups.
- `trunc` ,  `clip` : Controls outliers and improves robustness.
- `decay` : Smooths signals, reducing noise and turnover.

✅  **Datasets to prefer:**

- Use stable and predictive datasets:  `mom` ,  `rvol` ,  `rev` ,  `eps` ,  `return` , etc.
- Ensure high  **Out-of-Sample (OS)**  performance and good  `sharpe` .

✅  **Tips to keep both >1:**

- Use  **diverse and uncorrelated alphas** .
- Focus on  **low turnover** , high  `sub_universe_sharpe` .
- Neutralize properly:  `SECTOR` ,  `COUNTRY` , or  `STATISTICAL` .
- Always check  **investability-constrained metrics** .

I think that there is no operator can help you boost your combine. The valuable factor here is your alpha. Imagine that when you diversify your own pool alphas and each alpha has a good performance and you will have a better combine alpha performance.

Hi  [AS77213](/hc/en-us/profiles/10752416693655-AS77213) , i can share few things that i am working on to target your question.

**Attend WorldQuant Webinars -**  Try to attend webinars hosted by WorldQuant - these sessions provide valuable insights and learning opportunities that can significantly enhance your alpha development skills.

**Operator and Dataset Diversification**

- Experiment with different operators to diversify your signals.
- Explore various data fields beyond the commonly used ones.
- The key is diversification - don't rely on a single approach.

**Focus on Quality Over Quantity**

- Prioritise signal quality rather than trying to create many mediocre alphas.
- Avoid overfitting your signals to historical data.
- A well-constructed, robust alpha is better than multiple weak ones.

Great question! Improving both combined alpha performance and combined selected alpha performance often comes down to two key areas: better signal extraction and effective diversification. Operators like decay_linear and ts_corr can help stabilize your signals, while using datasets such as returns and vwap can strengthen their predictive power. Also, keeping your turnover low and alpha correlation minimal will go a long way. I’d love to hear more about any specific strategies you’ve tried to consistently keep these metrics above 1

Câu hỏi rất hay! Để cải thiện cả hiệu suất alpha tổng hợp và hiệu suất alpha đã chọn tổng hợp, trước tiên bạn nên tập trung vào các alpha có độ tương quan thấp và hiệu suất ổn định. Hãy chọn các alpha có IS/OS vững chắc và turnover thấp. Tránh chọn các alpha bị trùng ý tưởng vì sẽ làm giảm hiệu quả trong meta-model. Các toán tử như  `rank` ,  `zscore` ,  `scale` , và  `decay`  giúp làm mượt tín hiệu và tăng tính ổn định. Về dữ liệu, nên ưu tiên các nguồn phản ánh tín hiệu trung-dài hạn như dự báo lợi nhuận, ước tính của chuyên gia, hoặc dữ liệu cơ bản, thay vì kỹ thuật ngắn hạn. Ngoài ra, hãy đa dạng hóa theo region (GLB, ASI, CHN...) để hạn chế rủi ro khi một khu vực kém hiệu quả. Cuối cùng, hiệu suất cao không đến từ alpha mạnh riêng lẻ, mà từ cách kết hợp thông minh, kiểm soát chặt chẽ và đánh giá lại hàng tháng.

To improve your Combined Alpha Performance (CAP) and Combined Selected Alpha Performance (CSAP), the key lies in building high-quality, low-correlation alphas that consistently perform well out-of-sample. Focus on signal strength, not just complexity—tools like  `ts_zscore` ,  `rank` ,  `decay_linear` , and  `ts_corr`  can help refine patterns from core datasets such as returns, volume, VWAP, and industry-neutral metrics. But beyond operator choice, what matters most is the uniqueness and consistency of your ideas.

It’s also important to submit alphas regularly, maintain balanced regional performance, and keep turnover and drawdown low. Since CAP equally weighs each region, even one poorly performing region can drag your overall score down. Meanwhile, CSAP rewards alphas that get selected, so focus on building robust and diverse Power Pool-style alphas to increase your selection rate.

Have you found any particular field or signal transformation that consistently helps your alphas get selected for the platform?

Hello, my experience is that improving combined performance requires you to pay attention to the economic interpretability of your alpha, which means this alpha should have its own economic rationale. Additionally, avoid overfitting, as this will lead to poor out-of-sample (OS) performance. Even if the alpha curve you see looks beautiful, the actual OS performance may be extremely poor. It's also important to note that all alphas you submit are included in the combined performance. Therefore, to maintain good performance, you need to ensure that the quality of all submitted alphas is relatively high. Regarding select performance, you need to submit more alphas that can be selected. My experience is to try to submit atom and single-data alphas, and avoid using too many operators in your expressions—preferably no more than 8. This will increase the chance of being selected.

Here, your alpha is the important component.  Imagine having a superior combined alpha performance when you diversify your own pool of alphas and each alpha performs well.

### 评论 #18 (作者: AK52014, 时间: 1年前)

Combined Alpha Performance reflects the OS performance of all your submitted alphas, while Combined Selected Alpha Performance shows that of platform-selected ones. Maintain strong results by submitting high-quality, regionally balanced alphas with consistent performance across regions.

### 评论 #21 (作者: JK98819, 时间: 1年前)

To improve both my combined alpha performance and combined selected alpha performance, I learned that it's important to submit high-quality alphas with strong signals and low correlation between them. Using stable operators like  `decay_linear` ,  `rank` , and  `ts_corr` , and datasets like  `returns` ,  `volume` , and  `vwap`  can help. I also try to keep my alphas simple, well-balanced across regions, and avoid combining too many ideas in one. Thanks everyone for the helpful tips!

As mentioned in  [How-can-you-earn-more-Base-payment?](/hc/en-us/articles/4672184130455-How-can-you-earn-more-Base-payment)

these two combined critical depend on your regular submitted alphas, take more attention on daily submitted is a good way to increase your combined indicators. for me, I add some check process before summiting according on the link, like rank or sign alpha to check stability...

and 2nd way is try to submit SuperAlpha, super alpha combine more regular alphas, its' OS performance will has stronger risk - resistance ability than a single regular alpha.

### 评论 #23 (作者: RP41479, 时间: 1年前)

Operators alone won’t boost your Combined Alpha Performance—the key is your alpha quality. Diversify your pool with strong, well-performing alphas, and your combined performance will naturally improve.

### 评论 #24 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 1年前)

To increase both combined alpha performance and combined selected alpha performance, it's important to focus on optimizing both the alpha itself and the selection criteria used in your meta-model. You can experiment with different operators and datasets to achieve higher performance. Operators such as  `rank` ,  `zscore` , and  `group_rank`  often improve the stability and robustness of your alpha by emphasizing meaningful relationships between datafields. When it comes to datasets, it's essential to use high-quality and diverse datasets that provide relevant signals for your target market. This could involve using datasets that capture unique or underutilized patterns. Additionally, maintaining a high Sharpe ratio and minimizing transaction costs are key for sustaining performance above 1. Keep iterating on your alphas by testing different combinations of datafields and regularly evaluating the combined performance across various scenarios.

This thread offers an incredible collection of insights for anyone aiming to improve their Combined Alpha Performance (CAP) and Combined Selected Alpha Performance (CSAP). It's clear that there’s no single formula—what works is a disciplined mix of quality alpha construction, smart operator usage, and consistent region-wise balance. Operators like  `decay_linear` ,  `rank` ,  `ts_corr` , and  `group_rank`  seem to be widely endorsed, while datasets like returns, volume, and vwap repeatedly come up for their robustness. What stood out to me most is the emphasis on minimizing correlation, avoiding overfitting, and focusing on uncorrelated, high-fitness alphas. Definitely bookmarking this thread for ongoing reference—thank you all for such a rich discussion!

To boost both Combined Alpha Performance (CAP) and Combined Selected Alpha Performance (CSAP), it's crucial to refine not only the alpha formulas themselves but also the criteria your meta-model uses for selecting them. Start by exploring a variety of operators—such as  `rank` ,  `zscore` , and  `group_rank` —which are known to enhance signal resilience by highlighting consistent relationships within the data. At the same time, prioritize working with diverse, high-quality datasets that offer strong predictive value for your target universe. This may involve sourcing alternative or less commonly used data that reveals distinctive behavioral trends. Equally important is maintaining a solid Sharpe ratio while keeping transaction costs low, which directly supports long-term alpha viability. Consistent iteration—through testing various datafield combinations and assessing performance across changing market conditions—will help you uncover more effective and stable signals. Success lies in balancing innovation with discipline in both alpha creation and selection.
