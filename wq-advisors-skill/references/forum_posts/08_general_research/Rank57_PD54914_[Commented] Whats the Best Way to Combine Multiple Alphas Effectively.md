Hello everyone,

As I continue building and testing different alphas, I’m exploring how to  **combine multiple signals**  to create a more stable and diversified strategy. I’ve read that blending alphas can reduce risk and improve overall performance, but I’m unsure about the best approach to do this efficiently.

Should we use  **equal weighting** ,  **IC-based weighting** , or  **machine learning techniques**  like PCA or regression for combining alphas? How do you deal with correlations between signals to prevent redundancy and overfitting? Also, are there best practices for evaluating the combined alpha’s performance versus individual alphas?

I’d love to learn how experienced researchers approach alpha blending and portfolio optimization on BRAIN.

Kind regards

Alpha blending is all about balance. IC-based weighting or PCA usually works well, and checking correlations is key to avoid overlap and overfitting.

How do you usually combine multiple alphas to improve stability and reduce overlap? Do you prefer equal weighting, IC-based weighting, or ML methods like PCA to handle correlation and optimize performance?

Combining alphas works best when you control correlation and keep the blend simple. Many researchers start with equal or IC-based weighting, then use PCA or clustering to avoid redundancy. Testing the combined signal against each component helps ensure the blend adds stability rather than just noise.
