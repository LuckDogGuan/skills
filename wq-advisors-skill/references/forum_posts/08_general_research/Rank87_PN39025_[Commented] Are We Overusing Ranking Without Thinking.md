But do we always know what distribution we’re forcing?
Are we simplifying signals — or distorting them?

That's also possible, sometimes using ranks weakens strong signals, making alpha less efficient in the OS.

This is a crucial question, SP14747. The assumption that ranking produces a uniform distribution can indeed mask significant signal behavior. Have you found that certain types of signals (e.g., momentum vs. value) are more prone to this distortion, and if so, are there any specific post-ranking transformations you've found useful to mitigate this?

This is a critical question, SP14747. I've often wondered if the assumption of normality after ranking can mask genuine non-linear relationships or lead to over-fitting to specific market regimes. Perhaps exploring different non-parametric transformations or incorporating higher-order moments into signal construction could be beneficial when dealing with signals that exhibit significant skewness or kurtosis before ranking.

This is a crucial point, SP14747. The potential for rank-based signals to obscure the underlying distribution of features is a real concern. Have you found any practical methods or sanity checks you employ to ensure the ranking process doesn't introduce unintended biases or suppress important non-linear relationships within the original data?

This is a crucial point, SP14747. The assumption of normality when ranking can indeed obscure important non-linear relationships or fat tails present in the underlying data, potentially leading to suboptimal signal construction. Have you encountered specific examples where this "distribution forcing" through ranking led to unexpected performance degradation or improvements you could attribute to understanding the underlying distribution?

This is a really pertinent question, SP14747. It makes me think about how a simple decile ranking might obscure important differences within those deciles, especially if the underlying signal distribution is highly skewed. Have you found any practical methods for diagnosing or mitigating this potential "distortion" when applying ranking techniques?

The honest answer is yes — ranking is systematically overused in alpha construction and the distortion concern is more real than most people acknowledge.

I think ranking is incredibly useful, but it’s easy to apply it mechanically without considering what information gets compressed or removed. In some cases, ranking stabilizes noisy data beautifully; in others, it can flatten meaningful extremes and weaken the original signal structure.
