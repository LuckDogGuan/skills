Hi, the signal in this neutralize is quite good. I don't know if you are having difficulty finding the signal or reducing the correlation or something else. Knowing the problem will help everyone give more accurate advice.

In general, I choose  *neutralize fast*  when working with short-term or reversion-style alphas that align more with fast-turnover dynamics, this helps clean up quick market noise without over-smoothing. On the other hand, I use  *neutralize slow*  for longer-horizon or trend-based alphas where stability and lower turnover are more important. When in doubt or if the alpha mixes characteristics,  *slow + fast*  can help balance both ends. The right mode often depends on your alpha's nature, how reactive or persistent the signal is.

Use  `neutralize=slow`  for longer-horizon or trend-following alphas where signal stability and low turnover are priorities. If you're unsure, or if your alpha combines both short- and long-term traits,  `slow_and_fast`  can provide a more balanced approach. Ultimately, the best neutralization mode depends on the alpha's nature how reactive or persistent the signal is.
