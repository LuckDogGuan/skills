## 帖子正文

I have been recently trying to run IND risk-neutralized alphas, but in the settings I cannot seem to place the neutralization. I am getting the neutralization selected is invalid. Is there anyone who has encountered the same issue, and what is a possible fix?

For the IND region, the Statistical neutralization isn't available so it might be because you are trying to use that it is showing you an error.

In the IND region,  **STATISTICAL** neutralization isn’t supported, so the error you’re seeing may be due to trying to apply that setting. If your alpha relies on statistical neutralization, you’ll need to switch to a different neutralization method for IND, such as SLOW or SLOW and FAST.
