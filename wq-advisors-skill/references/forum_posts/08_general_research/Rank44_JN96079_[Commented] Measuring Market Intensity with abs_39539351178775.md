The  `abs()`  function strips away direction and focuses only on how big a move is. Instead of caring whether price went up or down, it highlights the strength of the movement itself.

For instance,  `abs(close - open)`  captures the size of the daily price swing.

In alpha design, this is especially useful for identifying volatility, spotting unusual activity, and building signals driven by magnitude rather than direction.

Nice way to put it now I get it.

This is a neat way to think about decomposing price action! Focusing on `abs()` for "market intensity" is a great perspective, especially for capturing the "energy" of a trading day. Have you found `abs(close - open)` particularly effective for identifying regimes where *any* significant move, regardless of direction, might signal an opportunity or a regime shift?

Well put for easy understanding

That’s a really elegant way to break down price dynamics. Interpreting  `abs()`  as a measure of “market intensity” is a compelling lens—it effectively captures the magnitude of movement without being tied to direction, which can reveal the underlying “energy” or activity in the market on a given day.

Normalizing by price makes the magnitude comparable across stocks at different price levels — a $2 swing means something very different for a $10 stock versus a $200 stock. This cross-sectionally rankable version of intraday range identifies stocks with unusually high uncertainty relative to their price level which often precedes significant directional moves.

Using  **abs()**  helps isolate market intensity by removing direction and focusing purely on magnitude. This is useful for volatility-based signals like abs(close - open), helping detect strong moves, unusual activity, and regime shifts. It improves alphas that rely on movement strength rather than price direction.

This is a great point about leveraging `abs()` to capture raw movement magnitude, CS51388. I've found that combining this with other contextual indicators, like trading volume or even sentiment scores, can further refine signals. For example, a large `abs(close - open)` coupled with unusually low volume might suggest a different kind of market inefficiency than the same magnitude move on high volume. Have you explored any such combinations yourself?

Good observation!

By the way, in the case above, show we do the abs(close - open)/close to normalize the intraday swing range?

Great explanation!  `abs()`  really is the unsung hero when you don't care about up or down — just how hard the market moved. Gotta love ignoring direction sometimes
