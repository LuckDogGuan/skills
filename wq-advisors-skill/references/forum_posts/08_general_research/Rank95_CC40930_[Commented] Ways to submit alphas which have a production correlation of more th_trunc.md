I have been wondering what this message implies when the production correlation test fails

Sharpe is not at least 10% greater than the Sharpe of each Alpha with which it has a correlation greater than 0.7.

Hi!

If your alpha correlates with the pool greater than 0.7, it needs a Sharpe ratio at least 10% higher than the alphas it correlates with to be submittable.

It means your alpha has high correlation (over 0.7) with other alphas in the pool but does not meet the required Sharpe threshold for submission.

To pass the production correlation test, two conditions must be met:

1. **Self-correlation and Prod-correlation:**  Both must be below 0.7. Self-correlation refers to the correlation with other alphas you've submitted, while prod-correlation measures the correlation with all alphas submitted by all consultants.
2. **Sharpe Requirement:**  If your alpha's correlation with another alpha is greater than 0.7, it must have Sharpe at least 10% higher than each of those correlated alphas. This rule ensures that a new alpha adds unique value and isn’t a similar-performing variant of an existing alpha.

### Example

Suppose:

- **Your alpha’s Sharpe is** : 2.25
- **Existing alphas it correlates with (correlation > 0.7)**  have the following Sharpe ratios:
  - **Alpha A** : 2.0
  - **Alpha B** : 2.10

To meet the submission requirement, your alpha’s Sharpe ratio must be at least 10% higher than each of these correlated alphas:

#### Calculation

1. **10% above Alpha A’s Sharpe** :
   2.0×1.10=2.2
2. **10% above Alpha B’s Sharpe** :
   2.10×1.10=2.31

Therefore, to pass:

- **Your alpha's Sharpe (2.25)**  needs to exceed  **2.2**  for Alpha A and  **2.31**  for Alpha B.

Since 2.20 does not exceed 2.31 (the requirement for Alpha B), your alpha fails the production correlation test, as it doesn’t meet the Sharpe threshold for all correlated alphas. Even though it passes for Alpha A, it must pass for all correlated alphas individually.

For self-correlation, you can view the Sharpe ratios of the top 5 correlated alphas and can identify the highest Sharpe of submitted alphas. However, for prod-correlation, individual Sharpe ratios are not available, making it challenging to achieve the required sharpe.

This message implies that the Sharpe ratio of the current alpha is not significantly higher (at least 10%) than the Sharpe ratios of other alphas with which it shows a strong correlation (greater than 0.7).The goal of this check is to ensure that the alpha has a distinct contribution to the strategy and is not simply tracking or highly similar to other alphas in terms of risk-adjusted returns.

### 评论 #5 (作者: NH84459, 时间: 1年前)

The test is checking that the  **Sharpe ratio**  of the alpha in question is at least  **10% higher**  than the Sharpe ratio of any other alpha that is highly correlated with it (correlation > 0.7). This ensures that the strategy is  **not redundant**  and offers a  **distinct edge**  over other similar strategies.

If your Alpha doesn't meet this requirement, it might be seen as redundant or not adding significant additional value compared to the other correlated Alphas. Essentially, the system is telling you that the Alpha you're testing should outperform its highly correlated counterparts by a reasonable margin (at least 10%) to be considered valuable in the production environment.

**These are the criterions for Alpha Correlation and Sharpe Threshold Requirements**

1. **Correlation Conditions** :
   - **Self-correlation** : Measures correlation with your submitted Alphas; must be below  **0.7** .
   - **Prod-correlation** : Measures correlation with all Alphas in the pool; also must be below  **0.7** .
2. **Sharpe Requirement** :
   - If correlation > 0.7 with another Alpha, your Sharpe must be at least  **10% higher**  than each correlated Alpha.

- Make accurate financial projections and plan your budget effectively. Forecasting will help you anticipate future costs and sales, allowing for adjustments in advance.
- Regularly monitor your performance metrics, such as the O/S ratio, gross margin, and operating expenses, and take corrective actions when necessary.

Even if you build alphas with a correlation greater than 0.7, you can still submit it if the Sharpe ratio of your alpha is at least 10% higher than the alpha it’s correlated with.

### 评论 #10 (作者: SC43474, 时间: 1年前)

To submit an alpha with a correlation exceeding 0.7, it’s essential to demonstrate that the Sharpe ratio is at least 10% higher than each of the correlated alphas. This requirement ensures that the alpha offers unique value and isn’t merely duplicating the performance of existing strategies. If the submission fails this test, revisiting the alpha’s design to improve its Sharpe or reduce correlation can help. Understanding this criterion is vital for creating distinctive and impactful strategies within the production pool.

It's interesting to see how production correlation tests can impact the performance evaluation of alphas. Clarifying the significance of that 10% threshold in relation to the overall Sharpe ratio would be helpful. Are there any specific strategies or adjustments you've considered to enhance the alphas that face this issue?

To submit an alpha with  **prod-correlation > 0.7** , its  **Sharpe ratio**  must be  **≥ 10% higher**  than every correlated alpha. Improve Sharpe or reduce correlation to meet submission criteria.
