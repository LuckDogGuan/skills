If two alphas both have a Sharpe ratio of 2, will combining them produce a portfolio of Sharpe ratio above 2?

Mathematically, Sharpe only improves if the alphas have low correlation, which is why Brain strictly limits correlation against the production pool. However, even if the raw Sharpe increases, you have to look at the holistic impact: does combining them spike your Turnover or dilute your Margin, ultimately dropping your overall Fitness score? Furthermore, arbitrarily jamming alphas together just to force a higher In-Sample (IS) Sharpe is a classic recipe for overfitting, meaning your Out-of-Sample (OS) performance will almost certainly degrade.

Not always.

Combining two Sharpe 2 alphas only improves portfolio Sharpe if the signals are  **not highly correlated** .

Not neceserily.

Not always like that, but sometimes it does.

Not necessarily,it depends on the correlation between the two alphas.

If the two alphas are perfectly correlated, you are essentially trading the exact same signal twice. You double your returns, but you also double your risk. The portfolio Sharpe ratio remains exactly 2.
