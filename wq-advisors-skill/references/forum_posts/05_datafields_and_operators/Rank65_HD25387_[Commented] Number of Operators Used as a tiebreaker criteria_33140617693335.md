[LM22798](/hc/en-us/profiles/17659089649303-LM22798)  ,If we Focus on maximizing the  **average quality of your alphas**  (e.g., Sharpe ratio, consistency, risk-adjusted returns) since this is explicitly mentioned.or Don’t worry about operator count—unless you have insider guidance or evidence suggesting it plays a role, optimizing for alpha performance is your best strategy.

Great question! To increase the number of operators for tie-breaker purposes, try gradually introducing  **less commonly used but simple operators**  like  `abs` ,  `log` ,  `reverse` , or  `signed_power` . Even small changes in structure (like wrapping a  `zscore`  inside a  `group_neutralize` ) can increase your operator count without making the logic too complex. Just make sure the added operators still support the signal idea — don’t force it only for the number!

When it comes to increasing operators for the tie breaker criteria, the best approach is not just to add operators randomly but to introduce  **meaningful diversity**  in how your signal is constructed. If two alphas are structurally similar, adding more operators that perform the same role (like extra smoothing or repeated ranking) won’t really help reduce overlap. Instead, focus on incorporating operators that introduce  **different perspectives on the data** . For example, you could add temporal operators (ts_rank, decay, rolling stats) alongside cross-sectional ones (rank, zscore) so the alpha captures both time-series and relative effects. Nonlinear operators like signed_power, log, or conditionals can also create unique curvature in the signal.
