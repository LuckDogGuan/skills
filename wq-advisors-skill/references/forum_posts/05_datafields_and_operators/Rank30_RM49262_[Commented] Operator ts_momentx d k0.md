### Definition

Computes the  **k-th central moment**  of  `x`  over the past  `d`  days.

Mathematically:

where xbar is the mean of  `x`  in the window.

### Intuition

- **Central moments**  describe the shape of a distribution around its mean.
- Different values of  `k`  capture different statistical features:

k
Meaning
Notes

0         
Always 1
By definition

1
Always 0
Mean deviation cancels out

2
Variance
Spread/volatility measure

3
Skewness (unnormalized)
Direction of asymmetry

4
Kurtosis (unnormalized)
Tail heaviness / peakedness

Great explanation! Clearly shows how central moments reveal distribution shape, from variance to skewness and kurtosis. Very insightful!

Great breakdown—short, precise, and straight to the point. Highlighting the intuition behind different k values makes it much easier for newcomers to link the math with real statistical interpretation.

Well I guess I have to get to expert level first in order to use this operator. But good to know its mechanism. Thanks for sharing this

That’s a thoughtful reflection! You nicely tied the statistical meaning of moments back to their practical role in alpha design. Highlighting your prior focus on variance/skewness and your new takeaway about kurtosis shows real learning value. It’s the kind of comment that both acknowledges the clarity of the original post and adds your own applied perspective—perfect for forum engagement.

Very clear and useful breakdown! I like how you mapped each k directly to an interpretable statistical feature—variance, skewness, kurtosis—making the operator much easier to apply in practice. It’s also a good reminder that higher-order moments aren’t just theory but can add real nuance to alpha design when looking beyond simple volatility. Thanks for sharing this in such an intuitive way.
