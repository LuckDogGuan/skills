Umm increase in decay leads to decrease in turnover but this is not only the factor that affects your sharpe as there are many things you have to consider like fitness , drawdown, returns, margins….. and these are manipulated by several operators directly or indirectly.

Use Learn section to know more about the terms…

Higher decay  smooths the alpha, reduces turnover, and often improves fitness if the signal is noisy—but it can flatten the ladder shape by lowering responsiveness. Lower decay  keeps the alpha more reactive, increasing turnover and potentially sharpening the ladder, but may hurt stability. There's no universal "recommended" value; try starting around 5 and optimize based on your alpha's half-life and backtest results.
