**Tips for getting started with  [Other](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets?category=other)  Datasets:**

- The "Other" category contains datasets from various sources, including NLP-based data, company relationships, equity flow information, and more.
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing):**  NLP uses algorithms and computational techniques to analyze and interpret human language. In finance, it extracts insights from news articles, earnings reports, social media, and other text-based data sources. NLP is useful for gauging market sentiment, identifying emerging trends, and detecting potential risks or opportunities by processing large volumes of textual data.
- **Company Relationships:**  This category involves understanding the connections and interactions between companies, such as supply chain relationships, partnerships, and competitive dynamics.
- **Equity Flow:**  Equity flow refers to the movement of capital into and out of stocks, including metrics such as net inflows and outflows, trading volume, institutional activity, and ETF flows. Monitoring equity flow helps investors understand market sentiment, track trends, and identify potential buying or selling opportunities based on fund movements in the market.

**Example Alpha ideas:**

- Positive sentiment in earnings calls often indicates strong future performance, while negative sentiment can signal potential downturns. Use oth384_presentation_negnum and oth384_presentation_posnum to capture sentiment information in conference call conversations.
- Institutional investors have the resources and insights to detect emerging opportunities and risks. By tracking their activities via equity flows, you can identify stocks gaining institutional interest. Use oth17_fmdscore1, oth17_fmdscore2, and oth17_fmdscore3 data fields to identify stocks with strong inflows.

**Recommended Datasets:**

Hi,

Thank you for your great article!

Upon searching for other datasets mentioned in the Recommended Datasets section, I found other432 (DNN prediction of fundamental| [DNN prediction of fundamentals | WorldQuant BRAIN](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/other432?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=GLB&universe=TOP3000) ) nearby.

If we have different methods of prediction and estimation of fundamental, then could it be viewed as similar and interchangeable? That is, could we apply known methods and templates of fundamentals and model estimates of fundamental previously known to this other432 dataset, that predicts the fundamental using DNN methods?

The known template are: ts_zscore(fundamental/model fundamental, d), group_zscore(fundamental/model fundamental, group), their equivalent operators and combination.

Thank you.

Hope to find more quality signals!

Other432 have DNN estimates of quite many familiar fundamentals indicators that have existing Alpha templates, but they need to fill the coverage, so maybe some operators such as backfill/to_nan could be helpful in preprocessing this datafields before applying the templates.

This could lead to the potential template: fundamental_template(backfill_operators(oth432_datafield,)).

What do you think about this adjusted template?

Thank you.

Happy learning!

Hi,

Could employees' tenure and compensation data an indicator of the company's financial performance, thus their respective stock returns performance?

Since the longer the tenure of the employees, the more resilience the company's working environment and financial resource could be over a long period of time. Since this may indicate that the company's workers are relatively satisfied working at the company amid changes in the overall environment over time.

Moreover, if the compensation data indicate promising results, this may suggest the strong, stable and resilient the company's financial performance. Since if the company's financial performance is good, they may have good financial budgets for compensating their employees. This, in turn, could motivate the employees to deliver more promising results.

In other128 datafield (Global Executive Performance Factors| [https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/other128](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/other128) ) mentioned in Recommended Datasets, there are data about executives' work-related criteria. Could it signify the company' stocks returns, thus provide us with quality Alpha signals?

Thank you.

Hi,

The "Other" category offers diverse datasets, including NLP-based insights, company relationships, and equity flow information, each providing unique opportunities for financial analysis.

- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** : NLP processes large volumes of text, such as news articles or earnings calls, to extract market sentiment and detect trends or risks. Positive sentiment often signals growth, while negative sentiment may indicate challenges.
- **Company Relationships** : This data explores how companies interact, such as through supply chains or partnerships, helping identify strategic dependencies and competitive dynamics.
- **Equity Flow** : Tracks capital movement in stocks, like trading volume or institutional activities, offering clues about market sentiment and opportunities.

**Alpha Ideas** :

- Analyze sentiment in earnings calls to forecast stock performance. For example, use  **oth384_presentation_negnum**  (negative sentiment) and  **oth384_presentation_posnum**  (positive sentiment).
- Monitor equity flow data fields like  **oth17_fmdscore1-3**  to spot stocks attracting institutional investment, often a sign of potential growth.

Positive sentiment in earnings calls is often linked to strong future performance, while negative sentiment can signal potential downturns. By analyzing the sentiment in conference call conversations, you can capture valuable insights using data fields like oth384_presentation_negnum and oth384_presentation_posnum. Additionally, institutional investors play a crucial role in spotting emerging opportunities and risks. Monitoring their activities through equity flows helps identify stocks gaining institutional interest, with data fields such as oth17_fmdscore1, oth17_fmdscore2, and oth17_fmdscore3 highlighting stocks with strong inflows.

How can the analysis of sentiment in earnings calls be used to predict short-term stock movements?
