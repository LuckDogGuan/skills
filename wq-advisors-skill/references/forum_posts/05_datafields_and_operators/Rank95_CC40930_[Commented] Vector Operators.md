Hi,

Vector data fields capture information for data that changes across the day. A few examples would be news alerts, news coverage, analyst coverage data. These datasets have a series of values per day, compared to matrix datasets, such as close, open, vwap, sales, income etc.which have a singe value per day.

To integrate vector data into the alpha, we need to utilize  vector operators to aggregate vector data, explained here:  [WorldQuant BRAIN](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/data-and-operators/operators)

For detailed article regarding vector dataset and their usage, refer the below article:

Hello, you should find data in the form of vectors, first try to simulate raw data, you will get the result of brain experiencing diffucult, then nest the vector functions to reduce the dimension into a matrix, then you will be able to simulate

Vectors are usually more complex, with more than one dimension than matrices (only stock and time dimensions), so you need vector functions to reduce the dimensionality.

The  **vector operator**  in quantitative finance is a powerful tool used to apply operations on a set of assets in parallel, handling multiple variables at once to generate insights or signals for alpha generation. This operator is particularly useful when working with data across different assets or cross-sectional data, as it allows you to perform consistent calculations across groups of assets in a single step.

The distinction between vector data and matrix data fields is important when managing time-series data.

**Vector data fields**  are designed to capture datasets that change throughout the day and therefore contain multiple values per day. These are dynamic datasets where data points are recorded at different intervals or can represent a range of data points over time.

**Vector Data** : These are datasets where the data changes over time within a day, meaning they have multiple values or time points within a single day. Examples include:

- **News Alerts** : The number and type of alerts throughout the day.
- **News Coverage** : The frequency of news coverage for a particular asset throughout the day.
- **Analyst Coverage** : Analyst recommendations or ratings that might change during the trading day.

As you mentioned, vector data fields capture information that changes throughout the day and provides a series of values for each day. Examples include  **news alerts** ,  **news coverage** , and  **analyst coverage data** . This data often has multiple observations or values throughout the trading day, reflecting changes in real-time. For example, news sentiment data or social media coverage might change throughout the day and need to be aggregated to make sense of it in the context of daily trading activity.
