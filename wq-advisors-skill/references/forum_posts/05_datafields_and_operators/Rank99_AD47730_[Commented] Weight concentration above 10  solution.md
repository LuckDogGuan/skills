I have tried using different methods to solve this problem, but this method really works.

Trying lower truncation values like 0.05,0.01 instead of  0.1,0.5,0.6

You can also reduce weight concentration by improving signal diversification, adding stronger normalization, or using ranking operators before allocation.

Lower truncation values help distribute weights more evenly and reduce concentration risk effectively.

They did help initially but not working now.

Great catch. Lower truncation thresholds often smooth out weight concentration much better, especially when a few names dominate the signal. I’ve also seen combinations like  `truncate(x, maxPercent=0.01)`  with  `normalize()`  or  `rank()`  help stabilize allocations further.

Hello FO71399, you can also try using backfill operators. Works most of the time

This is usually because too many missing values ​​in the data cause the alpha values ​​to be overly concentrated in a few specific stocks. You can try using ts_backfill to fill in the missing values.

Backfill operator also work apart from lower truncation.

[FO71399](/hc/en-us/profiles/29845863064727-FO71399)  That is one typical issue we see for small regions, e.g. the date coverage is pretty low. You could try ts_backfill(), group_backfill(), or adjust the value of truncation on the parameter panel. In some cases, it would fix the issue directly.

Yes, lowering truncation can help, especially when the signal is too concentrated in a few names. But I think it is more like a first fix rather than the full solution.

If the issue keeps coming back, I’d also check whether the input data has too many NaNs or poor coverage. Sometimes the alpha is not actually “too strong”, it is just only producing valid values for a small number of stocks, so the weights naturally get concentrated there.

In that case, using  `ts_backfill()`  or  `group_backfill()`  can help a lot. I’d also try ranking or normalizing the signal before applying truncation, because that usually makes the distribution smoother.

So my usual order would be: check data coverage first, then try backfill, then rank/normalize, and finally adjust truncation. Lower truncation works, but if the root cause is missing data, it may not be stable across regions or universes.

Thank you for this wonderful insight.

Concentration problems are often better solved upstream than through portfolio tweaks. Improving signal diversity, normalizing aggressively, and ranking before allocation usually helps. Lower truncation values are also one of the simplest and most effective ways to avoid excessive weight clustering.

Standard truncation at 0.1 or higher removes the top and bottom 10%+ of your cross-sectional distribution — which sounds like reasonable outlier removal but can actually eliminate genuine signal. In many alpha expressions the most extreme cross-sectional positions are where the strongest predictive information lives.
