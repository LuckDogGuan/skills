Hi everyone,

I have two questions regarding alpha construction in Fast Expression:

1. Many research papers mention rebalancing every  *n*  trading days. Is there a way to represent this kind of holding period directly in Fast Expression?
2. To evaluate factor effectiveness, it's common to sort stocks into groups (e.g., deciles) and construct long-short portfolios based on group rankings (like going long on Group 1 and short on Group 10). Is there a method to express this grouping and holding logic within Fast Expression?

Looking forward to your insights—thank you!

Hi Great questions !

1. Holding period: You can use the `Hold` function or specify rebalancing frequency in your alpha definition. Check the Fast Expression documentation for specific syntax.

2. Grouping and long-short portfolios: You can utilize the `Rank` or `Quantile` functions to sort stocks into groups. Then, define your long-short portfolio logic using conditional statements or weighting schemes.

**Great questions!**

1. **For holding periods** : You can use  `ts_delay`  or  `ts_shift`  to simulate rebalancing every n days by shifting your signal by the desired number of trading days.
2. **For group sorting** : Use  `group_rank`  or  `group_percentile`  to sort stocks into groups (like deciles). You can then apply long-short logic based on the rankings, for example:
   bash
   `if_else(group_rank(factor, industry) == 1, long_position, short_position)
   `

Hope this helps!

Great questions! For holding periods, one approach in Fast Expression is to use  `ts_delay`  and  `ts_decay`  to simulate holding across multiple days—e.g., delaying signal execution or smoothing it out to mimic a rebalancing schedule. As for group-based sorting, while explicit decile construction isn’t directly available, ranking functions like  `rank`  or  `ts_rank`  can help approximate group logic, especially when combined with conditional expressions. Would be fantastic to see native support for grouped long-short simulation in future updates!

Thanks for the tips! Using  `Hold`  for rebalancing and  `Rank` / `Quantile`  for grouping makes implementing holding periods and long-short logic much clearer

Great questions — both touch on important practical aspects of translating academic factor testing into Fast Expression (FE). For the first part, while FE doesn’t have a direct “hold for n days” parameter, you can approximate rebalancing frequency by using operators like  `delay()`  to reference past signals, or by combining  `ts_decay_linear()`  /  `ts_mean()`  with appropriate window sizes so that the alpha value changes only on your intended rebalance schedule. This essentially smooths or freezes the signal until the next period. For the grouping logic, FE doesn’t explicitly create decile “buckets” like in portfolio sorting, but you can replicate the idea using  `rank()`  and logical conditions — for example,  `rank(x) < 0.1`  for top decile and  `rank(x) > 0.9`  for bottom decile, then combine these with  `sign()`  or direct subtraction to form a long-short signal. If you want to integrate both grouping and holding period, you can use conditional logic plus delayed signals to ensure consistent exposure over the intended time horizon.

Both are good questions that touch on a common gap between academic factor tests and how WQB Fast Expression works:

1. **Rebalancing every n days**
   Fast Expression doesn’t have a direct “rebalance every n days” switch. The closest workaround is to use  **time-series smoothing/decay operators**  ( `decay_linear` ,  `ts_mean` ,  `delay` ) so the signal effectively holds exposure longer. For example,  `delay(expr, n)`  approximates holding for n days by shifting the signal forward.
2. **Group/decile portfolios**
   There’s no built-in decile sort function. Instead, you can mimic grouping by using  **rank-based truncation**  or clipping. For example,  `rank(expr)`  gives cross-sectional order; applying thresholds (e.g., top 10%, bottom 10%) is done via truncation/winsorization or transforming into long-short signals (e.g.,  `(rank(expr) - 0.5)`  creates a balanced long/short exposure).

So, while Fast Expression can’t replicate full decile portfolio construction, you can  **approximate group-based logic with ranking + truncation**  and  **simulate holding periods with delay/decay operators** .
