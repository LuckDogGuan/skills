Hello WorldQuant Global Consultants,

I wanted to share some insights regarding the  **Valuation Models Dataset (mdl109)** , which includes a range of  **fundamental**  and  **technical vector data fields** . Understanding how the values are stored in these fields is essential for effective model development and analysis.

### 1.  **Fundamental Data Fields (e.g., mdl109_op_margin)**

The  **Operating Profit Margin (mdl109_op_margin)**  field is one of the core fundamental metrics in this dataset. It typically stores values on a  **quarterly**  or  **annual**  basis:

- **Quarterly**  data gives a more detailed, time-sensitive view of a company’s operating margin each fiscal quarter.
- **Annual**  data, on the other hand, aggregates the company’s performance over the full fiscal year, providing a broader perspective.

When working with this field, it’s crucial to verify whether the data is stored on a  **quarterly**  or  **annual**  basis to ensure accurate analysis.

### 2.  **Technical Data Fields**

The technical data fields in mdl109 focus on  **market behavior**  and  **price movements** , with values typically stored on an  **intraday**  basis. These fields include real-time data such as stock price and trading volume, updated throughout the day:

- **Intraday data**  is useful for capturing short-term market movements and trends, ideal for real-time analysis.
- Some technical metrics may also be stored on a  **daily**  basis if they summarize broader price or trend movements over a 24-hour period.

### Conclusion

In summary,  **fundamental data fields**  like  **operating margin**  are stored  **quarterly or annually** , while  **technical data fields**  are generally  **intraday** . Understanding the frequency of data storage in this dataset will help refine your analysis and model-building process.

Feel free to share your experiences or any further questions related to this dataset!

Nice post, however please note that for model109 particularly, the dataset is mostly consists of 1-length vector fields, not quarterly or intra-day information. Hence, vec_avg and vec_choose is the best choice most of the time.

Otherwise, what you have said could potentially worked in other datasets.

Thank you for the feedback and appreciation! I really appreciate the clarification regarding the structure of the mdl109 dataset—it’s helpful to know that it mainly consists of 1-length vector fields rather than quarterly or intraday data. Yes, vector operators like  **vec_avg**  and  **vec_choose**  can be used to take care of the vector data fields more effectively.

Thanks again for the valuable guidance; these insights are really helpful in refining our approach!

Thank you for sharing your insights on the  **Valuation Models Dataset (mdl109)** . This breakdown provides a valuable understanding of how fundamental and technical data fields are structured:

1. **Fundamental Data Fields** : Metrics like  `mdl109_op_margin`  (Operating Profit Margin) offer crucial insights stored on a  **quarterly**  or  **annual**  basis. Quarterly data supports detailed, time-sensitive analysis, while annual data provides a broader view of company performance. Verifying the frequency of storage is essential for accurate modeling.
2. **Technical Data Fields** : These fields, focused on market behavior (e.g., intraday stock price and trading volume), enable  **real-time analysis**  of short-term trends. Some may also include  **daily summaries**  for broader trends.

### 评论 #8 (作者: YC82708, 时间: 1年前)

The article provided helpful insights on the Valuation Models Dataset (mdl109), particularly focusing on the distinction between fundamental and technical data fields. I found the explanation of the Operating Profit Margin (mdl109_op_margin) useful, especially how it’s stored either quarterly or annually. This nuance is key for accurately analyzing a company’s performance, depending on whether short-term or long-term trends are being assessed.

The discussion of technical data fields being stored on an intraday basis also stood out. This allows for real-time analysis, which is crucial for capturing short-term market movements and trends. It's interesting to consider how both types of data complement each other, with fundamental data offering a broader view and technical data providing real-time insights.

Overall, the article is a practical guide for anyone working with valuation models, emphasizing the importance of understanding data storage frequencies for precise analysis.

This is a great overview of the Valuation Models Dataset (mdl109). Understanding the difference between the fundamental and technical data fields' storage frequencies is crucial for accurate modeling and analysis. The distinction between quarterly/annual data for fundamental metrics like operating margin and intraday data for technical metrics helps tailor the strategies to the specific market behavior you're analyzing. It's especially helpful for refining how you approach short-term versus long-term signals. I also think that verifying data frequency before applying models or strategies can prevent potential misinterpretations. Thanks for sharing these insights!

In addition to data frequency, attention should be paid to the quality and timeliness of the Valuation Models Dataset (mdl109). For example, fundamental data may be influenced by economic cycles, while intraday technical data is more susceptible to short-term market volatility. Handling missing values, synchronizing data, and adjusting for latency can enhance the accuracy of analytical models
