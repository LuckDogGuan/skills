### Designing Signals That Act Today, Not Yesterday

Delay-0 alphas are often misunderstood as “faster” alphas. In reality, they are  **better-aligned alphas**   signals whose logic, data availability, and structure all agree on  *when*  the information is known and  *when*  it should be traded.

Most failed delay-0 attempts don’t fail because the idea is weak, but because the  **signal leaks future information, reacts too late, or structurally behaves like delay-1** .

The goal is simple:

> **Use information that is fully observable today and structure it so the signal is actionable today.**

## 1. Start With Truly Same-Day Information

Delay-0 alphas must rely on data that is  **known before the close (or decision point)** .

Good delay-0 friendly data:

- Price-based fields (returns, ranges, intraday moves)
- Volume and liquidity metrics
- Risk and volatility measures
- Pre-computed sentiment or flow fields (already timestamp-aligned)

Risky data for delay-0:

- Fundamentals with reporting lag
- Revisions-sensitive estimates
- Fields that are updated after market close

**Rule:** 
If you’re unsure  *when*  the data is known, it’s not delay-0 safe.

## 2. Avoid Operators That Implicitly Push You to Delay-1

Many alphas accidentally become delay-1 because of operator choice.

### Fragile:

`ts_delta(df, 1)
`

This compares today to yesterday and often behaves like a delayed reaction.

### Better:

`df - df`

or

`df`

**Insight:** 
Delay-0 works best with  **same-bar information** , not comparisons that anchor on prior closes.

## 3. Prefer Cross-Sectional Logic Over Time-Series Logic

Time-series operators often need history to “confirm” a move, which slows reaction.

### Slower:

`ts_rank(df, 20)
`

### Faster (delay-0 friendly):

`rank(df)
`

Cross-sectional ranking allows you to act  **immediately on relative information** , which is ideal for delay-0 execution.

## 4. Keep Windows Short and Intentional

Long windows dilute immediacy.

### Bad for delay-0:

`ts_mean(df, 60)
`

### Better:

`ts_mean(df, 5)
`

or no window at all:

`rank(df)
`

**Rule:** 
If the alpha needs 60 days of confirmation, it’s probably not a delay-0 idea.

## 5. Use Conditioning, Not Smoothing

Smoothing operators (heavy decay, long averages) reduce noise but introduce lag.

Instead,  **condition when you trade** .

### Example:

`trade_when(
  df > ts_mean(df, 20),
  rank(df),
  0
)
`

You preserve immediacy while avoiding low-quality regimes.

## 6. Neutralize Early to Avoid Fake Delay-0 Returns

Many delay-0 alphas look good only because of market or sector exposure.

### Example:

`neutralize(rank(df), industry)
`

This ensures the signal is driven by  **same-day relative information** , not slow factor drift.

## 7. Control Extremes Aggressively

Delay-0 alphas are more sensitive to noise and microstructure effects.

### Example:

`clamp(rank(df), -2, 2)
`

Extreme spikes often lead to fast drawdowns if left unchecked.

## 8. A Canonical Delay-0 Alpha Example

`trade_when(
  df > ts_mean(df, 20),
  decay_linear(
    neutralize(rank(df - df), industry),
    3
  ),
  0
)
`

**Why this works:**

- Uses same-day information only
- Acts cross-sectionally
- Conditions on liquidity
- Applies minimal smoothing
- Avoids hidden factor bets

## Final Mental Model

> **Delay-0 is not about speed.
> It’s about alignment.**

If your  **data timing** ,  **operators** , and  **economic intent**  all live on the same day, delay-0 becomes natural  not forced.
