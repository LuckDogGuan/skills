In quantitative research, evaluating an alpha signal goes beyond simply observing raw returns. A useful approach is applying time-series operators to better understand how current performance compares to historical behavior. One such operator is  `ts_rank`

Thank you, but there are many cases where using ts_rank can negatively affect the signal, causing future signal breakdowns, right?

Great start—this is pointing in the right direction.

Time-series ranking like  `ts_rank`  is useful because it shows  **how unusual or strong the current value is compared to its own history** , rather than just looking at raw levels. This helps normalize signals across different stocks and makes them more comparable over time.

In alpha evaluation, it’s especially powerful for detecting  **momentum shifts, reversals, or regime changes** , since it focuses on relative position within a historical window rather than absolute movement.

Great discussion.  `ts_rank`  is indeed powerful for normalizing signals across time, but as noted, it can also amplify noise when the lookback window is too short or the underlying data is non‑stationary. I've found it works best when combined with a smoothing operator like  `ts_mean`  before ranking. Also worth testing different window lengths to avoid over‑reacting to recent outliers.
