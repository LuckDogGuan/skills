Yes — but the key is  **improving signal quality, not “tuning” it** .

Here are practical ways to increase Sharpe  **without overfitting** :

**1. Reduce noise, don’t add complexity**

- Use light smoothing (e.g., reasonable lookbacks)
- Remove redundant operators
- Cleaner signal → better risk-adjusted returns

**2. Improve signal intuition**

- Make sure the alpha has a clear economic reason
- Strong intuition usually translates to more stable Sharpe

**3. Control turnover**

- High turnover often inflates noise and costs
- Use decay or slightly longer horizons to stabilize returns

**4. Combine orthogonal signals**

- Blend low-correlated alphas
- Diversification improves Sharpe more reliably than tweaking one signal

**5. Neutralize properly**

- Remove unintended exposures (sector, market)
- Helps isolate true alpha → cleaner performance

**6. Focus on consistency, not peaks**

- Stable IS across periods > one strong backtest
- Consistency naturally improves Sharpe over time

Sharpe improvements that survive OOS usually come from reducing noise, not adding signal. Think orthogonality, turnover control, and better universe conditioning rather than more complex expressions.
