Time-series (TS) operators are the backbone of alpha creation—they don’t just look at today, they capture  *behavior over time* .

Here’s a quick breakdown:

- `ts_mean(x, 20)`  → smooths noise by averaging the last 20 days
- `ts_delta(x, 5)`  → spots change by comparing today vs 5 days ago
- `ts_rank(x, 10)`  → measures relative strength within a 10-day window
- `ts_sum(x, 30)`  → tracks accumulation and persistence over time

**When to use what:**

- Noisy data (e.g. sentiment) → go with smoothing like  `ts_mean`
- Trend detection (prices/returns) → use  `ts_delta`  or  `ts_rank`
- Long-term strength (fundamentals) → try  `ts_sum`
