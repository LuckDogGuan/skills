Hello Community,

Let's talk about Fitness. We’ve all been there: you build an alpha with a decent Sharpe, but it gets rejected with a Fitness score well below 1.0 (sometimes down near 0.10).

Since Fitness heavily penalizes high turnover and low returns relative to trading costs, a low score usually means the alpha is changing its mind too often or trading in and out of noise. Here is my current checklist for rehabilitating a low-Fitness alpha:

- **Applying Linear Decay:**  Using  `decay_linear`  is my first stop. Spreading the signal strength over a 5 to 10-day window drastically reduces the daily churn in the portfolio weights.
- **Step Functions over Continuous Data:**  Instead of using a raw continuous variable that updates every day, I sometimes use  `quantiles`  or  `buckets` . The signal only trades when an asset moves across a quantile threshold, significantly cutting down on micro-trades.
- **Increasing the Holding Period:**  Simply designing the alpha to forecast further out (e.g., building around a 10-day return instead of a 1-day return) naturally slows down the model.

What are your favorite expressions or methods for artificially lowering turnover without completely destroying the original alpha thesis?

Decay, bucketing, and longer horizons are powerful ways to improve Fitness sustainably.

Decay_linear is the right first stop but the window length choice matters more than most people realize. Too short a window — 3 to 5 days — reduces turnover modestly but often not enough to clear Fitness thresholds.

this is actually really helpful. seems Fitness matters way more for alpha than I thought. gonna track that from now on. appreciate the reminder

Improving Fitness usually means reducing unnecessary turnover while preserving predictive strength. Common methods include linear decay, smoothing signals, quantile bucketing, longer holding periods, hump/tradewhen operators, and stronger neutralization to avoid reacting excessively to short-term market noise.

I appreciate you opening up this discussion. I am keen to learn how others apply these methods.
