If yourEUR region alpha submission is taking time, it’s usually due to a few common reasons:🔹 High System LoadDuring active themes or peak hours, many users submit simultaneously, causing delays in simulation queues.🔹 Alpha ComplexityHeavy use oftime-series operators(long lookbacks)Multiple nested functions👉 These increase computation time significantly.🔹 Data & Region SizeEUR region includes a large universe → more stocks = slower simulation compared to smaller regions.🔹 Backend Processing DelaysTemporary platform latency or maintenance can slow submissions.🔹 What You Can DoSimplify expressions (reduce deep nesting)Lower lookback windows (e.g., 252 → 126 if possible)Avoid unnecessary operatorsSubmit duringoff-peak hoursCheck if similar alphas are already running (queue load)If delays arevery long (e.g., >30–60 mins), it may be a platform issue—worth retrying or checking announcements.
