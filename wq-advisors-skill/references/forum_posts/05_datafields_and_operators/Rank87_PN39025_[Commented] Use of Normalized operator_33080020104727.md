Normalization is key for making features comparable in quantitative analysis. You can use  `normalize(x)`  to scale a signal between 0 and 1 across the cross-section, which helps remove magnitude bias and improve comparability. It’s especially useful when combining different signals or ensuring neutrality. Just be mindful of the context—sometimes  `zscore`  or  `rank`  may be better depending on your goal.
