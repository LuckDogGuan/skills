If in one alpha the same operator use it two times then how many operators will be there in Operators per Alpha.

If in one alpha the same field use it two times then how many field will be there in Fields per Alpha.

Hey  [LR13671](/hc/en-us/profiles/4516642748055-LR13671)  the metrics are measured based on  **distinct**  operators, and data fields, so one operator or datafield will count only once to "operators per alpha", and "fields per alpha". Therefore, you could use one operator or field multiple times and would only count as 1.

Thanks for this post.

In case, in an expression we use generally used operators like hump, for eg. hump((hump_decay({x},hump=0.000))), i.e. 2 x operators , with decay as zero (not serving a purpose in this instance and automated submission using Brain API), shouldn't ideally be counted as zero operator(s)?

Regards.

Hi  [PJ65624](/hc/en-us/profiles/4630198283799-PJ65624) !

It is always beneficial to optimize your algorithm to ensure that every operator used has a meaningful impact and a clear rationale.

Thanks for sharing this insightful information! It’s great to see how the metrics are refreshed regularly, providing transparency and helping consultants track their progress effectively. Such updates are invaluable for aligning efforts with the program’s expectations and improving performance over time.

When you submit an alpha. If in that alpha you use an operator multiple times, the system will still only recognize it as an operator when calculating the Operators per Alpha index. And the same goes for Field.

This discussion is very insightful! It's crucial to ensure clarity in understanding how distinct metrics like "Operators per Alpha" and "Fields per Alpha" are calculated, especially for optimizing alpha submissions. Thanks to everyone for sharing these details. Focusing on meaningful use of operators and fields can indeed make a significant difference in overall performance. Looking forward to more updates and best practices from the community!

[LR13671](/hc/en-us/profiles/4516642748055-LR13671)  THis was really Important. Much needed clarification on this topic. And since tie breaker criterion will be used for deciding levels, it's important to keep the Operator/alpha criterion as low as possible.

Thanks mate !

The metrics are calculated based on unique operators and data fields. Each operator or data field is counted only once toward "operators per alpha" and "fields per alpha," regardless of how many times it is used. Howerver there are some operator that will count +2 in operator count!

In calculating  **"Operators per Alpha"**  and  **"Fields per Alpha,"**  the same operator or field being used multiple times is typically counted as multiple occurrences. Here's the reasoning for each:

### **Operators per Alpha**

If an alpha uses the same operator twice, it will count as  **two operators**  because the metric generally measures the total occurrences of operators used, not their uniqueness.

### **Fields per Alpha**

If an alpha uses the same field twice, it will count as  **two fields**  because the metric usually accounts for all field occurrences, regardless of repetition.

Let me clarify how operators and fields are counted in alphas:

### Operator Counting

- If the same operator is used multiple times in one alpha, each instance is counted separately
- Example:
  ```
  ts_mean(close, 10) + ts_mean(volume, 20)
  ```
  This counts as 2 operators, even though ts_mean is used twice

### Field Counting

- Similarly, if the same field is used multiple times in one alpha, each instance is counted as one unique field
- Example:
  ```
  ts_mean(close, 10) + ts_sum(close, 20)
  ```
  This counts as 1 field (close), even though it's used twice

### Key Points

1. Operators per Alpha:
   - Each operator instance counts separately
   - The total count includes all operator occurrences, regardless of uniqueness
2. Fields per Alpha:
   - Each unique field counts once
   - Multiple uses of the same field count as one field

This counting method is important for:

- Meeting operator limit requirements
- Optimizing alpha complexity
- Managing computational resources

It seems like you're delving into some interesting aspects of alpha performance analysis. To clarify your question, are you seeking to understand how duplicate usage of operators and fields in the same alpha affects the overall count of distinct operators and fields? Essentially, if they are counted uniquely despite repeated usage, that could lead to an interesting insight into their effectiveness.
