### 💡 What It Does

`ts_product`  computes the  **cumulative product**  of a time series over the past  `d`  days. Think of it as multiplying all values in a sliding window of length  `d` .

### 📊 Example

Given a price series over 5 days:
 `[1.02, 1.03, 1.01, 1.05, 1.04]`

Then  `ts_product(price, 3)`  on Day 5 would compute:
 `1.01 × 1.05 × 1.04 = 1.1002`

### 📈 Use Cases in Alpha Modeling

1. **Cumulative Growth Detection**
   - Use this to track compounding returns or growth patterns over short horizons.
2. **Momentum or Trend Strength**
   - A product well above 1 may indicate strong upward momentum; below 1 signals weakness.
3. **Return Aggregation Without Summation**
   - Alternative to using  `ts_sum(log_diff(x))`  when direct compounding is preferred.

### ⚠️ Caution

- `ts_product`  is  **not ideal for negative or zero values** , especially when paired with logarithmic transformations or ratios.
- Use safeguards like  `max(x, ε)`  if your data could contain small or zero values.
- It’s best combined with  **post-processing operators**  like  `rank()` ,  `delta()` , or  `ts_decay_linear()`  to enhance signal discrimination.

### 🧠 Pro Tip

For return series like daily returns in the form of  `(1 + r)` , using  `ts_product(1 + returns, d)`  gives the total return over  `d`  days in multiplicative form—ideal for compounding-based alphas.
