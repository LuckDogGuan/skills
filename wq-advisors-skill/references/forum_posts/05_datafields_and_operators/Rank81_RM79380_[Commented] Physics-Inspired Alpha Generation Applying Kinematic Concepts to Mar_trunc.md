The Data Creation Challenge is a great opportunity to look outside traditional financial metrics. I've been experimenting with adapting theoretical concepts from physics—specifically kinematics and momentum operators—into alpha signals to capture market overreactions.

The idea is to treat price movement as a physical system with velocity, acceleration, and restoring forces (mean reversion).

**For example:**  We can model a "restoring force" by measuring how far a stock's price has accelerated away from its historical center of gravity. An expression like  `rank(-ts_delta(ts_delta(close, 1), 3) / ts_std_dev(returns, 20))`  acts as a proxy for negative acceleration adjusted for volatility—essentially shorting assets that have decelerated after a volatile spike.

Have you successfully translated concepts from other scientific disciplines (like physics, engineering, or information theory) into stable alpha expressions? What operators do you find most useful for these translations?

Physics-style alphas can work surprisingly well when markets are treated as dynamic systems. Concepts like velocity ( `ts_delta` ), damping ( `ts_decay_linear` ), and restoring forces (mean reversion) often translate naturally into price behavior. The key is less about the metaphor itself and more about normalization, regime stability, and proper neutralization.
