Hi everyone,
I'm currently trying to learn how to use the  `vec_powersum`  operator effectively in alpha construction, but I haven’t come across a full example yet. I'd appreciate it if someone could share a working example or explain a common use case where this operator fits well.

I'm here to learn too I've seen  `vec_powersum`  mentioned a few times but haven’t had the chance to experiment with it properly. Would be great to hear how others are using it in real alphas, especially what kinds of inputs and use cases it fits best.

The  `vec_powersum`  operator is used to aggregate multiple vectors (e.g., signals, scores, or metrics) into a single value by applying a power transformation before summation. It helps emphasize stronger signals and suppress weaker ones, making it useful in scoring or combining multiple metrics.

Great question! I've used  `vec_powersum`  in a few cases where I wanted to emphasize stronger signal components while still keeping the full vector context. A typical use case is when you're working with a  **vector of factor exposures or sentiment scores**  — applying  `vec_powersum(..., p=2)`  acts like a norm and gives more weight to high-magnitude elements. Compared to  `vec_sum` , this operator helps  **enhance contrast**  between stocks with evenly strong vs. unevenly strong signals. It's also useful when combining multiple signals where you care about nonlinear reinforcement rather than just direction. Still experimenting, but it’s a solid operator for modeling signal strength asymmetrically.

Great that you're diving into  `vec_powersum` —it’s a powerful tool when working with vector outputs like industry or region groupings. A common use case is combining grouped scores, such as  `vec_powersum(industry_dummy * ts_zscore(valuation_metric), 2)` , to amplify strong group-level signals. It effectively highlights clusters with extreme behavior.

The  `vec_powersum`  operator aggregates multiple vectors into a single value by applying a power transformation before summing. This emphasizes stronger signals while down-weighting weaker ones, making it useful for scoring or blending metrics where dominant contributors should have greater influence in the final output.
