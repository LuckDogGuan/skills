Relationship data captures connections between companies and can be used in alphas depending on the datafield format.

**1. Group Form** 
Group relationship fields classify stocks into connected groups (e.g., sectors or related entities). These can be used with custom neutralization:
 `group_neutralize(alpha, group)`

Since many grouping fields are sparse, it is recommended to apply  **`densify()`**  to avoid errors:
 `group_neutralize(alpha, densify(group))`

Using this approach allows relationship data to capture competitive structure and improve alpha signals.
