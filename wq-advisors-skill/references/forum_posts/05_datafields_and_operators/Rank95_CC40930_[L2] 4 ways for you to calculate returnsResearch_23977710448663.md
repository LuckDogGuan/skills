# 4 ways to calculate returns

Looking to add a little more "return" to your day? Let's dive into some BRAINy ways to calculate returns. 😄

**The Classic Daily Returns** : We all know and love our faithful data field, 'returns', giving us those daily returns. But did you know you can calculate it yourself? It's as easy as ts_delta(close, 1) / ts_delay(close, 1). Now let's broaden the horizon to weekly returns!

**Method 1: Direct Calculation**

The most straightforward way to calculate weekly returns is to consider the price difference over a week. You can do this with the ts_delta() operator, which calculates the change between the current value and the value from N periods ago.

The formula for weekly returns would be: ts_delta(close, 5) / ts_delay(close, 5)

Here, ts_delta(close, 5) calculates the difference in closing prices over 5 days (one week), and ts_delay(close, 5) retrieves the closing price from 5 days ago. The division gives us the proportion of the change relative to the price from a week ago.

**Method 2: Cumulative Returns**

Another way to calculate weekly returns is to multiply the daily returns over the week. This is useful when the daily returns are small, but it may introduce larger errors when daily returns are substantial.

The formula for weekly returns would be: ts_product(returns + 1, 5) - 1

Here, returns + 1 converts the daily return rate to a growth factor. ts_product(returns + 1, 5) calculates the cumulative growth factor over the week, and subtracting 1 converts it back to a return rate.

**Method 3: Log Returns**

This method uses logarithms of growth factors to calculate returns. Like Method 2, it can calculate cumulative returns over a period, but it has the added benefit of being more numerically stable for larger returns.

The formula for weekly returns would be: exp(ts_sum(log(returns + 1), 5)) - 1

The log(returns + 1) calculates the log return for each day. ts_sum(log(returns + 1), 5) sums up the log returns over the week, and the exp function converts the cumulative log returns back to a growth factor, from which we subtract 1 to obtain the return rate.

**Method 4: Using ts_returns operator**

Simply ts_returns(close, 5) will give you weekly returns.

**ACTION** : Please share with the community, an alpha idea that uses weekly, monthly or annual returns!

Hi, 
Thank you so much for the detailed and well-structured article on various ways to calculate returns and formula with example that how it will be calculated will be very helpful.

I’m curious—have you explored any alpha ideas that incorporate these different return calculations for varying time horizons, like monthly or annual returns? Would love to hear your perspective!

Thanks for the methods you provided to calculate returns, I noticed there are many pre-calculated return fields in the data explorer, I will use these to reduce op/alpha. Anyway I understand better how returns work

Thank you so much for your insightful explanations on calculating returns! Your detailed breakdown of four distinct methods—Direct Calculation, Cumulative Returns, Log Returns, and using the  `ts_returns`  operator—has been incredibly helpful. These approaches give me a comprehensive toolkit for understanding and applying different return calculations depending on the data and context. The Direct Calculation method is the simplest, using price differences, while the Cumulative Returns method allows for more granular insights by considering compounded growth. The Log Returns method is excellent for handling larger returns with numerical stability, and using  `ts_returns`  is a quick, straightforward solution. I especially appreciate how you’ve outlined the advantages and specific applications of each method, allowing for better customization in alpha modeling. This guidance has given me a deeper understanding of how to incorporate returns calculations into risk management and model development. Thanks again for the valuable input!

### **Advantages of Using This Method** :

- **Simplicity** : This is one of the most straightforward ways to calculate weekly returns since it directly compares the closing prices of the asset over the specified period.
- **Transparency** : The method is easy to understand and transparent, making it a great starting point for simple return analysis.

Thank you for the detailed and well-structured article on calculating returns. The insights you provided are incredibly helpful, and examples showcasing how these calculations are performed would further enhance understanding. I’m also curious if you’ve explored alpha ideas that leverage different return calculations across various time horizons, such as monthly or annual returns. Additionally, I noticed the pre-calculated return fields in the data explorer, which can be a great way to reduce operations and streamline alpha development. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Here are four common ways to calculate returns in finance:

1. **Simple Return (or Arithmetic Return)**
   - **Formula:**  Simple Return=Ending Price−Beginning PriceBeginning Price\text{Simple Return} = \frac{\text{Ending Price} - \text{Beginning Price}}{\text{Beginning Price}}Simple Return=Beginning PriceEnding Price−Beginning Price​
   - **Use:**  Measures the percentage change in price over a period.
   - **Why I like it:**  It’s the most straightforward way to calculate return, ideal for individual assets over short timeframes.
2. **Logarithmic Return (Log Return)**
   - **Formula:**  Log Return=ln⁡(Ending PriceBeginning Price)\text{Log Return} = \ln \left( \frac{\text{Ending Price}}{\text{Beginning Price}} \right)Log Return=ln(Beginning PriceEnding Price​)
   - **Use:**  Calculates the natural log of the price ratio.
   - **Why I like it:**  It’s useful for continuous compounding and ensures that returns are time-invariant, especially when dealing with multiple periods.
3. **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)**
   - **Formula:**  CAGR=(Ending ValueBeginning Value)1n−1\text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{\text{Ending Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1CAGR=(Beginning ValueEnding Value​)n1​−1
   - **Use:**  Measures the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period longer than one year.
   - **Why I like it:**  It’s great for understanding long-term investment growth, as it smooths out volatility and shows average yearly performance.
4. **Total Return**
   - **Formula:**  Total Return=Ending Value+Dividends (or Interest)−Beginning ValueBeginning Value\text{Total Return} = \frac{\text{Ending Value} + \text{Dividends (or Interest)} - \text{Beginning Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}}Total Return=Beginning ValueEnding Value+Dividends (or Interest)−Beginning Value​
   - **Use:**  Includes price appreciation/depreciation plus any dividends or interest earned.
   - **Why I like it:**  It provides a complete view of an asset’s performance, including income from dividends, making it suitable for income-generating assets.

Each method serves different purposes depending on the timeframe and the data available. For short-term analysis, simple returns are great, while CAGR and total return are better for long-term investments that include reinvestments.
