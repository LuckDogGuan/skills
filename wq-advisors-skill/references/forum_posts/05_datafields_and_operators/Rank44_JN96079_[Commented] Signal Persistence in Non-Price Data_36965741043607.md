Turnover clustering is often examined through returns, but the concept might extend much further. Sentiment jumps, volume bursts, or other micro-structure shifts may also exhibit their own form of temporal persistence. Tools like ts_corr(x, lagged_x, d) can help reveal whether a signal repeatedly echoes its past or if it’s just random fluctuation.

The real question is whether these clustering patterns in non-price data translate into meaningful predictive power, or if they simply magnify noise without offering real edge.

Has anyone explored this direction or tested such persistence in their alpha research?

This is an interesting direction, and I think you’re right that persistence is not exclusive to price-based signals. In my own testing, non-price data such as sentiment, volume imbalance, or micro-structure indicators often show  *state persistence*  rather than direct return predictability. Using tools like  `ts_corr(x, delay(x, 1), d)`  or comparing short- vs. long-window autocorrelation can help identify whether these features cluster meaningfully or simply oscillate around noise. The key, however, is separating persistence from overreaction. Many sentiment or volume bursts echo themselves for several periods, but without an economic transmission mechanism, this persistence alone does not translate into alpha. I’ve found better results when persistence is used as a  **filter or regime condition** —for example, activating a downstream alpha only when non-price persistence exceeds a threshold via  `trade_when` . In this way, temporal clustering enhances signal timing rather than becoming the signal itself.

I’ve seen similar behavior in non-price data—persistence shows up more as  *state memory*  than direct predictability. Autocorrelation in sentiment or volume often indicates regime continuity, not alpha by itself. Using persistence as a gating or timing filter (rather than a standalone signal) has worked better for me, especially to avoid amplifying structured noise.

This is a very thoughtful extension of the turnover-clustering idea, and I think it’s absolutely valid to push it beyond pure price space on  **WorldQuant Brain** . In my experience, non-price data  *does*  exhibit temporal persistence, but the interpretation has to be much stricter. Using tools like  `ts_corr(x, lagged_x, d)`  is a good diagnostic step—not to claim predictability outright, but to identify whether the data has  *memory*  rather than being i.i.d. noise. For sentiment, volume bursts, or positioning proxies, persistence often reflects  **information diffusion**  or  **behavioral inertia** , not tradable continuation by default.

Where things usually break is when persistence is mistaken for directionality. A signal can strongly echo its own past yet still fail to predict returns once costs and neutralization are applied. I’ve found persistence more useful as a  *filter*  or  *regime indicator* —for example, conditioning a price or value signal on whether sentiment persistence is elevated—rather than as a standalone predictor. If persistence survives mild decay changes and doesn’t collapse under basic neutralization, that’s when it starts to look like structure instead of magnified noise.

Thank you for raising this question—this is exactly the kind of conceptual exploration that pushes research beyond template-driven thinking. I really appreciate how you framed persistence as something to  *test and question* , not assume. Too often, non-price signals are either dismissed as noise or blindly trusted because they look “different,” and your post sits thoughtfully between those extremes.

Your emphasis on tools as diagnostics rather than guarantees is especially valuable. It encourages a mindset of investigation rather than confirmation. Even when these persistence effects don’t translate directly into alpha, understanding them can still sharpen how we design filters, regimes, or supporting signals. Thanks for opening this discussion—it’s a great reminder that not all useful research paths lead directly to Sharpe, but many lead to better understanding, which ultimately compounds over time.

I’ve observed a similar pattern in non-price datasets, where persistence tends to reflect lingering market states rather than direct predictive power. Autocorrelation in signals like sentiment or volume often points to regime continuity instead of offering alpha on its own. Treating persistence as a timing or gating mechanism—rather than as a standalone signal—has been more effective for me, particularly in preventing the amplification of structured noise.
