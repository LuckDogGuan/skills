Hi everyone,

I’m facing some difficulty while trying to create effective alphas in the China region. I would really appreciate suggestions from the community on which datasets tend to work best in this region, and which operators are usually more reliable.

If you have experience with building alphas specifically for China, please share your insights on:

Which datasets give stronger signals in this market.

What operators or transformations usually help in extracting meaningful patterns.

Any region-specific challenges or adjustments I should keep in mind.

Thanks in advance for your guidance!

Great question! From my experience, liquidity and fundamental datasets often work more reliably in China, while smoothing operators (like  `ts_mean` ,  `rank` ,  `decay_linear` ) help stabilize noisy signals. Also, always watch out for trading frictions and stricter constraints compared to US markets.

In my experience, liquidity and fundamental datasets tend to be more reliable in China, while applying smoothing operators—such as ts_mean, rank, or decay_linear—helps stabilize noisy signals. It’s also important to account for trading frictions and stricter market constraints compared to US markets.

Most of my alphas in the China region are derived from model datasets. By combining them with time-series operators (like  `ts_rank` , etc.), I think it’s an easy way to get started.
