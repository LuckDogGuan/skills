I couldn’t find option-related indicators like delta and gamma in the dataset. Is this due to permission limitations?
Looking forward to hear it from you

That's a great question, DT49505. Option Greeks like delta and gamma are indeed not standard readily available features in many general market data feeds. Often, you'd need to calculate these yourself using option pricing models (like Black-Scholes-Merton) and underlying volatility data, or look for specialized datasets that provide these derived metrics, though those can be quite expensive. Have you considered exploring historical implied volatility surface data as a potential proxy or input for your calculations?

Hi DT49505, that's a common hurdle when starting with option analytics. While direct delta/gamma might not be readily available in all datasets, have you explored calculating implied volatility from options data and then using established Black-Scholes or similar models to derive those Greeks? It's a good exercise in understanding the underlying drivers of option pricing.

From what the community generally understands, traditional options Greeks like delta and gamma as direct data fields are not prominently featured in the standard BRAIN dataset library. This is less likely a permissions limitation and more likely a dataset availability issue — options microstructure data is significantly more complex to source, clean, and maintain than equity price-volume or fundamental data, and most quantitative research platforms focus on equity-level signals rather than derivatives-level Greeks directly.

Hey, actually, the option23 dataset has some data fields with the related names. You could try finding in that datafield and check if you get what you are looking for!

Hi DT49505, that's a common question when first exploring option data. Many datasets focus on underlying equity prices and core financial statements, as option Greeks can be quite complex to derive and may require specialized data providers or on-the-fly calculation. Have you considered looking into data vendors that specialize in derivatives or exploring academic libraries for pre-computed option metrics, if available through WorldQuant BRAIN's research platform?

Hi DT49505, that's a common question when digging into option data! The raw datasets on BRAIN primarily focus on fundamental and price data, and option Greeks like delta and gamma are typically derived through more complex modeling or specialized data providers. You might need to explore external APIs or build your own option pricing models to generate those metrics. Have you considered any specific modeling approaches or sources for this type of data yet?
