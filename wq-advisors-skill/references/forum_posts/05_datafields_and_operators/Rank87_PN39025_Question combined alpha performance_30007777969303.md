Hello everyone, I have two questions:

1. Are decommissioned alphas included in the OS Sharpe calculation for Combie?
2. When using Combie Select for performance optimization, if the selected alpha group is underperforming, does the system remove those alphas and replace them with better ones, or does it simply add new alphas to the existing group?

Thanks, everyone!

Typically, decommissioned alphas (those that have been removed or are no longer active) should not be included in the OS Sharpe calculation for Combie. The OS Sharpe ratio is based on the active set of alphas and their performance, so once an alpha is decommissioned, it would not contribute to the calculation. However, this can depend on how the system is set up and if there's any lag or caching mechanism, so it’s worth checking the specific rules of your setup or documentation.

- **Decommissioned Alphas & OS Sharpe:**
  - Decommissioned Alphas are  **excluded**  from OS Sharpe calculations.
  - Only active Alphas contribute to the metric.
- **Combie Select & Underperformance:**
  - Combie Select  **adds new Alphas**  to enhance performance.
  - It  **does not remove**  underperforming Alphas automatically.
  - Manual intervention is needed to adjust the Alpha group.

**News Sentiment** : You can analyze news articles, financial reports, or headlines using  **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  techniques. A simple approach is to calculate a  **sentiment score**  (positive, neutral, or negative) and use it as an alpha signal.

For OS Sharpe in Combie, decommissioned alphas are typically excluded to reflect only active strategies. Regarding Combie Select, it likely prioritizes adding stronger alphas but may not always remove underperforming ones immediately—understanding the rebalancing logic is key.

Interest rate decisions from the European Central Bank (ECB) can significantly impact the performance of bonds or interest rate swaps. Understanding and anticipating monetary policy changes will help in improving the risk/reward balance.

The OS Sharpe ratio (likely referring to a Sharpe ratio calculation that's specific to your system) measures risk-adjusted return by considering the excess return over a risk-free rate divided by the standard deviation of those returns.

Your questions are quite insightful, and I'm sure many in the community are wondering the same! Regarding your first question on decommissioned alphas and the OS Sharpe calculation, I think it’s crucial to clarify whether the calculations account for past performances. As for the second question, it would be interesting to know how Combie Select balances between maintaining a diverse alpha group while optimizing performance. Are there any guidelines on how often these adjustments are made?

Decommissioned alphas are not included in OS Sharpe calculations, as only active alphas contribute. Combie Select enhances performance by adding new alphas but does not automatically replace underperforming ones.

*combining alphas allows you to enhance overall portfolio returns while managing risk. The key is to blend  **uncorrelated**  strategies to improve the  **risk-adjusted performance** , reduce volatility, and achieve more consistent excess returns.*

I would like to ask about the calculation Combined Alpha Performance and Combined Selected Alpha Performance :

- As far as I know, these 2 indicators will be updated 2 times in 1 quarter, so the 1st time will be used to evaluate how to use the alphas in the period of time, and the same is true for the 2nd time

Yes, decommissioned alphas are  **excluded**  from OS Sharpe calculations, as the metric reflects only  **active alphas** . Since OS Sharpe is designed to measure the performance of currently deployed strategies, any  **removed or inactive alphas no longer contribute** .

Regarding  **Combie Select & Underperformance** :

- **Combie Select**  adds new alphas to  **enhance overall performance**  but does  **not automatically remove underperforming ones** .
- **Manual intervention**  is required to  **adjust the alpha group** , ensuring  **consistent improvement** .

It’s also a good practice to  **review your system settings**  to confirm whether there’s any  **lag or caching**  affecting decommissioned alpha exclusions from OS Sharpe.

When calculating the OS Sharpe ratio for Combie, decommissioned alphas should typically be excluded, as the ratio is designed to reflect the performance of only active alphas. Once an alpha is decommissioned, it no longer contributes to the calculation. However, this can depend on your specific system setup, and there may be mechanisms like lag or caching that need to be considered. It's a good idea to check the rules or documentation of your setup to confirm how decommissioned alphas are handled.

For Combie Select, the platform may focus on adding stronger alphas, but it might not immediately remove underperforming ones. Understanding the rebalancing logic and how often the system updates is crucial for managing alpha performance effectively.

Do you find that lag or caching mechanisms often affect your alpha management, or is it more about keeping track of real-time performance?

It looks like there’s a solid consensus that decommissioned alphas don’t factor into the OS Sharpe calculation, which makes sense for keeping performance metrics clean. As for Combined Selected, it’s interesting that it adds new alphas without automatically removing the underperformers. Do you think a more dynamic approach—where the system could replace weaker alphas—would lead to better overall performance, or does the current method allow for more strategic adjustments?

When using Combie Select for optimization, if a selected alpha group is underperforming, the system generally does not replace the underperforming alphas directly. Instead, the system may add new alphas to the existing group based on optimization criteria. However, if you see continued underperformance, it may be a good idea to manually review the selected alphas and consider removing or replacing them with more effective ones.

Your questions highlight some important aspects of alpha performance management. Understanding how decommissioned alphas impact the OS Sharpe calculation can really clarify the overall performance picture. Additionally, the mechanics behind Combie Select's optimization process are crucial for effective strategy development. Have you noticed any trends or specific behaviors from the systems in handling underperforming alphas that might inform your strategy further?
