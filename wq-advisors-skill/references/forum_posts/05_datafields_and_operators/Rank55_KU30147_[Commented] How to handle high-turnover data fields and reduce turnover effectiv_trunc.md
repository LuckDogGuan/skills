## 帖子正文

Hi everyone,

While experimenting with different data fields in my alpha ideas, I’ve noticed that some fields tend to produce  **very high turnover** .

I’m trying to understand  **how to work with these high-turnover data fields effectively**  — specifically how to  **reduce turnover without losing too much alpha signal** .

A few questions I’d love feedback on:

- Which  **operators or transformations**  have you found most useful for controlling turnover ?
- Are there certain  **parameter settings**  that help smooth signals from noisy fields?

I’d appreciate any  **general guidance or best practices**  for making high-turnover data fields more stable while avoiding overfitting.

Thanks for any insights.

关于高换手率数据字段的处理，我在WorldQuant Brain平台回测时也遇到过类似问题。大佬提到的平滑噪声字段信号确实很关键，我通常会用移动平均、标准化或者分位数截断这些算子来降低换手。不过要注意参数设置，太激进的平滑可能会损失alpha信号。另外，组合多个相关性较低的高换手因子也是个思路，可以在保持信号强度的同时分散换手风险。回测时发现，简单的滞后操作或者波动率调整对某些数据字段效果不错，但需要针对具体字段特性来调整。

You can reduce turnover either by increasing or decreasing decay or by operators like hump, hump decay,hump(x,hump=0.05).

Great question high-turnover fields are common, especially when working with noisy short-horizon data. A few approaches that often help:

1. Smooth the raw signal

2. Use longer windows

3. Add rank-based transformations

4. Control trading explicitly

5. Neutralize early

6. Avoid overly reactive fields

In general:
 *Smooth → stabilize → neutralize → trade-control* .
This flow usually gives lower turnover with minimal loss of edge.

You can reduce turnover by adjusting the decay—either increasing or decreasing it depending on the signal’s behavior—or by applying operators such as hump, hump_decay, or formulations like hump(x, hump=0.05), all of which help smooth the signal and moderate excessive trading.
