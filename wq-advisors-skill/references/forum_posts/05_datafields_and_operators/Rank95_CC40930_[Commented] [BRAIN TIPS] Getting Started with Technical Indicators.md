Technical indicators are heuristic or pattern-based signals based on the price/volume of a financial asset. They can help us make better trading decisions by identifying trends, momentum, support and resistance levels, and other important market signals. Common examples of technical indicators include moving average, Bollinger bands, and relative strength index (RSI).

**What you need to build Technical Indicators**

Recommended Data fields

How is VWAP Calculated?

Let’s say for example that during the course of the sessions, 40 stocks are purchased at a price of $118.00, 10 were purchased at $119, 10 at $120, and another 10 at $121 as seen in the table below.

To calculate VWAP, simply multiple the volume and price of each order together and divide it by the volume total.

> $121.00

Recommended Operators

Most of the operators required are arithmetic and time-series operators. For example, a moving average may be calculated using ts_mean. Check out the  [Operators page](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/data-and-operators/operators)  to learn about their functionalities.

**Sources of Ideas**

Investopedia is a good place to begin, with a series of 9 articles covering technical indicators. You can check out the first article  [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp) .

Afterwards, you can check out  [Elearnmarkets](https://www.elearnmarkets.com/blog/best-25-technical-indicators/#17-volume-at-price) , which provides 25 commonly used technical indicators.

Lastly, for more advanced learning, you can visit  [Stockcharts’ ChartSchool](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=technical_indicators:moving_averages) , comprising a very comprehensive collection of technical indicators.

**Tips for Technical Indicator Alphas**

Customization: Technical indicators can be customized with different time periods to suit specific trading strategies and objectives. For example, the moving average indicator can be divided into short, medium, long term indicators based on the time period 10 days, 50 days, and 200 days respectively.

Simulation Settings: Using different neutralizations and decay settings can improve the signal of technical indicators through reduction of turnover or increase in returns. Try out each variation and see which is the most effective.

Dealing with Outliers: Outliers represent a fundamental challenge in alpha research, the effect being that weight becomes highly concentrated on a few stocks. If you see the message “Weight is too strongly concentrated” in your IS test results, consider using  **rank** ,  **ts_rank** ,  **zscore**  and  **ts_zscore**  to remove such outliers.

I would like to add that time-series operators like ts_max_diff, and ts_scale also work well with technical indicators; and often have low correlation

Technical indicators are used to analyze the price and volume of financial assets to identify trends, momentum, support, resistance levels, and other market signals. To build effective technical indicators, you'll need price data (open, close, high, low, and VWAP) and volume data, along with appropriate operators.

Technical indicators play a crucial role in technical analysis, helping traders and investors identify potential trends, market conditions, and entry or exit points. These indicators are based on  **price**  and  **volume**  data and can reveal a lot about market sentiment and potential future price movements.
