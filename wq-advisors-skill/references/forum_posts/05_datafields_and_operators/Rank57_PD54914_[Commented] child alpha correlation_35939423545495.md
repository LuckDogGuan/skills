Hey everyone, i have seen when making child alphas through LLM i counter the correlation problem, like it does not pass PP correlation. Do you have any tips on how to solve it or regarding the prompt to be given to LLM.

Try the same alpha expression on the different simulation settings that you have used rarely in the past submissions.

Give the LLM more specific prompts, e.g., specify certain datafields or operators instead of a generic “generate an alpha”. Also, set and regularly update custom rules to keep your alphas unique.

A practical approach to lower correlation in child alphas is to diversify both the operator and dataset space used by the LLM. Incorporate field-specific prompts (e.g., focusing on volume, sentiment, or volatility factors) and apply transformations such as neutralization or smoothing to modify structure. Testing across different universes or horizons can also help differentiate the signal behavior and improve PowerPool correlation outcomes.

A practical way to reduce correlation among child alphas is to diversify both the operator choices and the datasets used by the LLM, guiding it with field-specific prompts that emphasize different themes such as volume, sentiment, or volatility. Applying structural transformations like neutralization, smoothing, or alternative time horizons can further separate signal behavior. Evaluating the alphas across different universes or delay settings also helps reveal unique dynamics, ultimately improving correlation outcomes within the PowerPool.

A practical way to reduce correlation among child alphas is to intentionally diversify both the operator space and the datasets used during generation. Guiding the LLM with focused prompts—such as emphasizing volume dynamics, sentiment signals, volatility behavior, or liquidity effects—helps ensure that each alpha captures a different market mechanism rather than repeating the same structure. Structural transformations also play an important role: applying neutralization, smoothing, alternative decay settings, or nonlinear operators can materially change signal behavior even when using similar inputs. In addition, testing alphas across different universes, delays, or holding horizons often reveals distinct response patterns and prevents overfitting to a single regime. This combination of conceptual diversity, structural variation, and cross-environment validation is essential for building a PowerPool with genuinely complementary signals rather than superficially different expressions.

Which technique has been most effective for you in reducing correlation without hurting alpha stability?
