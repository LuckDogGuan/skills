We’re seeing some eye-catching D0 EUR correlation in prod—does that mean the alpha on the other side of my trade can still walk away profitable? How should I convert my alpha into the opposite side and still pass the tests? puzzling...

Correlation only measures directions of movements, not the "size" of movements. That is, the alpha (say alpha B) which has correlation of -0.9721 with your alpha(say alpha A) tends to have negative returns when your alpha shows positive returns. However, the absolute values of negative returns will be relatively small compared to those of positive returns. Thus, in such circumstances it is possible for alpha A and B to be both profitable, while having high negative correlation. In my opinion, figuring out alpha B will be difficult. Since it is likely that alpha B will be structurely different from alpha A.

[YP80321](/hc/en-us/profiles/13224980672663-YP80321)  OK, it is mainly about the sign of the daily returns then... very helpful, thanks!

Correlation reflects only the direction of movement, not the magnitude, so an alpha B that shows a correlation of –0.9721 with alpha A will typically produce negative returns when A is positive, but those negative returns may be much smaller in size, allowing both alphas to remain profitable despite strongly negative correlation. In practice, discovering such an alpha B is challenging because it will likely differ structurally from alpha A.

Correlation captures only the direction of movements, not the magnitude, so an alpha B with a correlation of –0.9721 to alpha A will usually move in the opposite direction, but the size of its negative returns may be much smaller than the positive returns of alpha A. This dynamic makes it possible for both alphas to remain profitable even when their correlation is strongly negative. The real challenge lies in designing such an alpha B, because a signal that consistently moves against another while still generating positive performance typically requires a fundamentally different structure. It often reflects an alternative market mechanism, dataset behavior, or timeframe sensitivity. Building this kind of complement usually demands deeper experimentation, strong intuition about market inefficiencies, and careful validation to avoid spurious relationships.

Have you experimented with creating negatively correlated alphas using different datasets or just structural variations of existing signals?

Correlation only reflects the direction of movement, not the scale. For example, an alpha B with a correlation of –0.9721 to alpha A will tend to move oppositely, but its losses may be smaller than alpha A’s gains. This dynamic allows both alphas to remain profitable despite a strong negative correlation. Designing such an alpha B, however, is challenging. Achieving consistent counter-movements while maintaining positive performance usually requires a fundamentally different approach—whether through an alternative market mechanism, a distinct dataset, or a different timeframe. Developing these complementary alphas requires careful experimentation, a deep understanding of market inefficiencies, and rigorous validation to ensure the relationship is genuine rather than coincidental.

Correlation describes only the direction of co-movement, not the relative size of returns. An alpha with a correlation close to –1 against another will typically move in the opposite direction, yet its drawdowns can be much smaller than the gains produced by the first signal. Because of this imbalance in scale, both alphas can remain profitable despite strong negative correlation. The difficulty lies in constructing such a complementary signal. Achieving reliable opposite behavior while maintaining positive performance usually requires a fundamentally different design, such as exploiting another market mechanism, using a distinct dataset, or operating on a different time horizon. Creating these relationships is rarely accidental and demands careful experimentation, strong intuition about inefficiencies, and thorough validation to ensure the behavior is structural rather than coincidental.

Correlation captures co-movement in direction, not return size. So even if alpha B has a correlation of -0.97 with alpha A, it may simply move opposite to A while generating much smaller losses when A is positive. This allows both signals to remain profitable despite strong negative correlation. In practice, however, finding such an alpha B is difficult, since it usually requires a fundamentally different structure from alpha A.

Correlation measures co-movement in direction, not magnitude. So an alpha B with -0.97 correlation to alpha A might move opposite A but with smaller losses, letting both remain profitable. In practice, finding such an alpha is hard, as it needs a fundamentally different structure from A.

Correlation reflects co-movement in direction rather than return magnitude, so an alpha with a –0.97 correlation to another will typically move oppositely, even if the absolute size of its losses is much smaller than the other’s gains. This allows both alphas to remain profitable despite strong negative correlation. The difficulty lies in constructing such a complementary signal, as consistently opposing behavior with positive performance usually requires a fundamentally different design. In practice, this often stems from distinct market mechanisms, data characteristics, or time-horizon sensitivities, and demands extensive experimentation, strong economic intuition, and rigorous validation to avoid spurious effects.

Yes—high prod correlation means someone may be trading a similar signal, but not necessarily your exact side. Flipping the sign alone often fails tests; structure and timing asymmetry matter more.
