## 帖子正文

In the Brain platform, there are three types of data fields:

Matrix
Group
Vector
While matrix and group data fields can be used directly, the vector data field requires an extra step. A vector data field holds one or more values for a single instrument within a day, so it needs to be converted to a matrix using specific operators before it can be used in alpha generation.

Operators for Vector Data Fields
The platform offers various operators to transform vector data fields into a matrix format, including:

vec_avg , vec_choose, vec_count, vec_ir, vec_kurtosis, vec_max, vec_min, vec_norm,  vec_percentage, vec_powersum, vec_range, vec_skewness, vec_stddev, vec_sum

If you’re new to vector data fields, start with the vec_avg operator, which simply provides the mean of the vector field.

For further details, explore the Learn section on the Brain platform.

And also use different different regions and find positive values then try in alpha ideas

As you said that vec_avg can be a good starting operator to start with vector datafields. Can you give example of the potential use of other vector operators like vec_range, vec_choose and vec_norm.

Some use cases of vec_range or vec_std_dev:

- Assimilating the deviation of analyst estimates/sentiment of a particular financial item or value into your alpha idea

- understanding skew of sentiment scores in news or sentiment or social media dataset, and factoring its impact into your alpha

PS: Do look at the "vec_count" of the datafield as sometimes count could be equal to 1 or 2 or 3 (for most stocks) in which case it would probably not make much sense to use vector range or standard deviation.

Could you provide detailed examples of alphas that effectively use the  `vec_choose`  operator? I find it challenging to fully grasp its nature, practical use cases, and how it contributes to alpha construction in various scenarios. Tks!

Hello, I would like to ask if there is a way to use vector data directly without going through the vec operators? Nesting vec is already considered an operator.

The Brain Team has launched a new operator for vector data: vec_filter. The vec_filter operator is a powerful tool designed for efficient preprocessing of vector data. It allows you to filter out unwanted values, such as  `nan` ,  `0` , or any other specified values, in a simple and effective way. For instance, you can filter multiple values at once using a command like vec_filter `(vec, value="nan 0 10")` . This makes it ideal for cleaning datasets before further analysis or modeling. I have used it to preprocess data and saw a significant improvement in my IS performance. You should try it!

Hello, I would like to ask if it is possible to nest 2 consecutive vec_ functions together? For example vec_avg(vec_norm()). Looking forward to receiving support. Thank you very much.

[NH84459](/hc/en-us/profiles/18243573453207-NH84459)  I don't think there is any option for it! However, I have observed a few datasets have mean/median/standard deviation in matrix datafield formats of many similar datafields that are also vector datafields. Maybe those could be used!

Great explanation of vector data fields and their transformation! Using the right operators to convert vector data into a matrix is a key step in making these data fields usable for alpha generation. The  `vec_avg`  operator is a great starting point for those new to this, as it provides a simple mean value for the vector, but as you become more familiar, operators like  `vec_skewness`  or  `vec_kurtosis`  allow you to capture more advanced statistical properties.

Hi  [TN74933](/hc/en-us/profiles/21997837037719-TN74933) ! It depends on which value you assume to be most relevant for your Alpha. For example, if you think that the more recent value is the most relevant, then you can use the vec_choose operator to choose the latest value for the day, e.g. vec_choose(vector_data, -1).

Hi  [NH84459](/hc/en-us/profiles/18243573453207-NH84459) ! Vector data will need to be converted into matrix form using vector operators.

Hi  [ND68030](/hc/en-us/profiles/9496734822295-ND68030) ! Yes it is possible, but it wouldn't have much effect, because the first vector operator would already have reduced the vector data to one value per day per stock, so the second vector operator would only have one value to work with.

In building alpha models, using operators to transform vector data fields, such as vec_avg or vec_skewness, helps uncover hidden signals in the data, thereby optimizing trading strategies. These factors not only assist in identifying trends or market turning points but also enhance the ability to generate sustainable profitability

The details about converting vector data fields into a matrix format are quite enlightening! It’s interesting how operators like vec_avg can simplify the process for newcomers. Exploring different regions to enhance alpha generation sounds like a strategic approach. What specific challenges do you think one might face while using these operators for the first time?

As you mentioned, vec_avg can serve as an effective initial operator for working with vector data fields. Could you provide examples of the possible applications of other vector operators such as vec_range, vec_choose, and vec_norm.
