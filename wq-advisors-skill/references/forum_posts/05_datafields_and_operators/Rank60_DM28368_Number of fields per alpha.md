When using the group_min(x, group) function to find the minimum value of x based on the group specified by the group parameter, if we set group = 'industry', is 'industry' considered a field in the dataset or merely a reference value? In other words, does 'industry' represent a column in the dataset?

In the context of thegroup_min(x, group)function,'industry' must be a column (a field) in the dataset. It isn't a reference value or a string literal; it acts as the key by which the data is partitioned. The function then calculates the minimum value ofxfor each unique category found within the 'industry' column.

Thanks for raising this question! I’ve often wondered the same thing when working with functions likegroup_min. It’s easy to assume that parameters such asindustryare fields, but your post made me think more carefully about how datasets are structured. I really appreciate you clarifying this point because it’s important for understanding how field counts are measured. This helps me avoid miscounting fields in my own alphas and keeps my designs aligned with platform expectations.

Thanks for bringing this up — it’s something I’ve been wondering about as well! Sometimes I get confused about what exactly counts as a “field” versus what’s treated more like a parameter, and your question really highlights that gray area. I like seeing how others think about this, because it pushes me to double-check my own assumptions. I’ll definitely keep experimenting to see how ACE handles it in practice. Appreciate you sparking this discussion!

thanks for such information , when building alphas, the “number of fields” refers to how many unique dataset columns are actively used in the formula. For example, in a function likegroup_min(x, industry), bothxandindustryare treated as fields because the function requires values from both columns. The key point is that grouping variables (likeindustry) are not just reference labels but actual dataset fields that partition the calculation.

Thanks for raising this — I’ve had the same questions myself! It’s easy to get confused about what counts as a “field” versus a parameter, and your post really highlights that gray area. Seeing how others approach it helps me re-evaluate my assumptions, and I’ll keep experimenting to see how ACE treats these cases in practice. Appreciate you starting this discussion!

I think you used 2 field: x and industry

Thank you for bringing up this question! I have frequently pondered the same issue when dealing with functions like group_min. It’s simple to presume that parameters like industry are fields, but your post prompted me to reflect more deeply on the structure of datasets.
