Hello, Consultants

Let's examine today how alpha concepts can be produced using the PEG ratio.  By accounting for a company's anticipated profits growth, the PEG (Price/profits to Growth) ratio enhances the conventional P/E ratio and provides a more accurate assessment of value in relation to growth.

PEG = (Price / Earnings) / Growth Rate is the formula.

Where:

Current Stock Price ÷ EPS equals P/E

G = Anticipated yearly growth in earnings (based on past patterns, analyst projections, or corporate advice)

Undervaluation is typically suggested by a PEG < 1, while overvaluation may be indicated by a PEG > 1.

Implementation of Alpha: Sample template:
 (P / E / G - 1, industry) -group_zscore

Depending on your strategy, you can change the operators to employ techniques like regression_neut, vector_neut, or switch to group_rank.

Considerations:

PEG inputs are adaptable, so select your data sources appropriately.

The PEG ratio—(Price / Earnings) / Growth Rate—adds a growth perspective to the traditional P/E ratio, making it a more balanced valuation tool. PEG < 1 often suggests undervaluation. For alpha design, you can normalize or rank the PEG by industry using operators like  `group_zscore` ,  `group_rank` , or apply neutralization methods.

PEG is a powerful metric because it brings a growth-adjusted perspective to valuation, which pure P/E often lacks. By incorporating expected earnings growth, it allows for a more forward-looking signal—especially useful in identifying growth stocks trading at a discount.

I like the suggested Alpha template—normalizing  `(P/E)/G - 1`  across industry groups via  `group_zscore`  is a clean way to standardize the signal and ensure comparability. Also agree that operator choice (like  `regression_neut`  or  `vector_neut` ) can further refine the Alpha depending on the broader design goal—whether it’s to remove sector bias or align with a particular style exposure.

Definitely a useful starting point for building valuation-growth hybrid Alphas.

Thanks for sharing!

Thanks for sharing this! PEG-based alpha ideas are quite insightful, especially when normalized across industries. I’m also experimenting with PEG-style signals and exploring variations like using forward earnings estimates or applying smoothing to growth rates. Looking forward to seeing how others are implementing this too.

The concept of PEG-based alpha is compelling when you normalize it by industry. I’m running my tests on PEG-style signals, tweaking parameters such as forward earnings projections and applying smoothing techniques to growth rates. I’d be very interested to learn how others are tailoring these approaches.

Thanks for sharing! PEG-based alpha strategies are genuinely insightful, especially when normalized across industries. I’ve been experimenting with PEG-style signals as well, exploring variations like incorporating forward earnings estimates and applying smoothing techniques to growth rates. I'm keen to see how others are approaching this too.

The PEG ratio improves valuation by accounting for earnings growth (PEG = P/E ÷ Growth). A PEG below 1 suggests undervaluation. Alpha signals can be created by normalizing (e.g., group_zscore) PEG minus 1 within industries. Operators like regression_neut or group_rank offer alternative normalization techniques. Data source quality matters.

Appreciate you sharing this! PEG-driven alpha strategies offer valuable insights, particularly when adjusted for cross-industry comparisons. I've been testing out similar signals myself—exploring variations like integrating forward earnings projections and smoothing earnings growth. Excited to see how others are tackling this space too.

Incorporating PEG into alpha design is a solid way to balance valuation with growth expectations. I've found that using forward-looking earnings and smoothed growth estimates improves stability, when combined with industry-relative neutralization to reduce noise from volatile growth inputs.
