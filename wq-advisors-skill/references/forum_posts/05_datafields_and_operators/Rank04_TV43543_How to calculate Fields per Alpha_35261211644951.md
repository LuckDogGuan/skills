For a submitted alpha that has 2 duplicate fields within the same alpha, for example, two 'return' fields, will the system count this as 1 Field per Alpha or 2 Fields per Alpha? Thanks everyone.

what a question maybe similar to operators

if the alpha is like  return * return it would count as 2, however if predefine variable

s= return then s*s would count as 1?

I think that's how operators calculation. I would like to hear others input ? and as a top level consultant what is your experience ?

Thanks

In BRAIN, each usage of a field counts, even if duplicated. So if your alpha includes ‘return’ twice, it will be counted as 2 fields, not 1.

That will be  **2 Fields**  per alpha since they all add to something in your field. In that case, simple math is paramount; you use 1 field, it becomes 1 field per alpha. You use 2 or three, that will be either 2 or 3 fields per alpha, respectively, no matter if it's a duplicate. ^^JN

When an alpha is submitted with duplicate fields inside the same expression—for example, two separate instances of the  `return`  field—the system does not collapse them into a single entry. Instead, each instance is counted independently. This means that even if the fields are identical, the system still treats them as two distinct Fields per Alpha. From a practical perspective, this has implications for how field counts are tracked in reporting and constraints. It’s important to be mindful of this, since duplicates can inflate the field usage tally and potentially affect compliance with platform-level field limitations.

That means each distinct input you add counts as a separate field in the alpha. So if you use only one, it’s 1 field per alpha. If you use two or three, it becomes 2 or 3 fields per alpha, regardless of whether some are duplicates. Simple arithmetic applies.

n BRAIN, fields are counted by actual usage, not just uniqueness. That means:

- If an alpha uses  `return * return` , it counts as  **2 fields** .
- If you assign  `t = return`  and use  `t * t` , it counts as  **1 field**  since the field is referenced only once.

So duplication matters — each explicit field reference increases the Fields per Alpha count.

Interesting question! From what I’ve seen, the system usually counts each direct use of a field separately, so  `return * return`  would be 2 fields. But if you assign it first (like  `s = return; s * s` ), then it’s treated as 1 field since the duplicate call isn’t repeated. This is similar to how operator counts are handled.

Good question — from what I understand, the system counts  **unique fields** , not repeated instances. So if the same field (like “return”) appears multiple times within a single alpha, it’s still considered  **1 Field per Alpha** . The count increases only when new, distinct fields are introduced. That said, using duplicates can still impact performance and computation, so it’s best to keep the expression clean and avoid unnecessary repetition.

So even if the same field, such as “return,” appears multiple times within an alpha, it is still treated as a single field per alpha, and the count only increases when a new, distinct field is added. That said, repeated use can still affect performance and computation, so keeping expressions clean and avoiding unnecessary duplication is generally best.
