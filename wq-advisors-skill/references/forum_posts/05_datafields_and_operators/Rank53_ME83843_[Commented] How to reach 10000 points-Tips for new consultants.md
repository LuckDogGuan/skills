Hello everyone,  
I wanted to share a few things that helped me hit the 10,000-point mark as a consultant on BRAIN — in case it helps anyone still getting started.

✅ Start Simple: Use popular datasets like pv1, model26, and risk70. These have good coverage and lots of alphas built from them.

✅ Play With Operators: Try rank, ts_rank, zscore, and ts_decay_linear. They work well when layered properly.

✅ Boost Your Signal: Once your

signal is stable, add a second dataset or neutralize to sector/industry using vector_neut.

✅ Backfill Where Needed: If you're getting low coverage, ts_backfill and days_from_last_change can help.

✅ Track Performance: Use the "My Alphas" tab daily to learn what’s working. Reuse successful patterns.

Excellent summary. Combining rank-based transformations with  `ts_decay_linear`  has improved my stability as well. I’d add that testing different decay windows can really fine-tune results.
