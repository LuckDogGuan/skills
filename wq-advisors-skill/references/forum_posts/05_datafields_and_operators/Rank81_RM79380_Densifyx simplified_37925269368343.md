**densify(x): compressing groups for efficiency**

When working with grouped data (industries, sectors, countries, etc.), group labels often have  **gaps** . These empty buckets don’t add information but  **slow down group-based calculations** .

`densify(x)`  fixes this by  **remapping group labels into a compact range**  from  `0`  to  `n−1` , removing unused buckets.

**What it does**

- Keeps the  **relative grouping exactly the same**
- Removes empty group IDs
- Makes group operations faster and lighter

**Why it’s useful** 
Group operators (like industry-neutral stats or group means) run more efficiently when group labels are dense.  `densify`  is a cleanup step that improves performance without touching the signal logic.
