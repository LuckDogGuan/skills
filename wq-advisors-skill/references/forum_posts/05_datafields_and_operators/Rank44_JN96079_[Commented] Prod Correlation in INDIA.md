My fellow quants, tried to create alphas in the newly added Region (IND), but to my surprise it's like prod_correlation is the order of the day. Could anyone try to elaborate it for me, I thought since the region was added recently there would be no prod.

Good observation, hoping to see comments of other quants and their experience, and how they are solving the same.

The high production correlation is due to the fact that some datafields are actually the same in every region, for example, a datafield like returns from price volume is actually the same for all the regions. So, mostly if you are working with similar data that is already used in other regions, then definitely you will get higher production correlation than anticipated. The good thing to do is to  **try to make an entirely different idea** . Otherwise, you can  **try to explore datafields that are new** , i.e., those that have specifically come with the INDIA regions, since they are there will be very low prod correlations.

Am surprised as well but on the same note its self correlation is very low and that encourages us as quants to do more meaningful research.

The  **prod correlation**  you’re seeing likely reflects similarities with existing global factors rather than prior submissions. Even in new regions like IND, some signals may still correlate with well-known styles or macro effects. It’s best to focus on  **unique local drivers**  and  **dataset combinations**  to lower correlation.

Even though IND is a new region, the system likely already seeded it with production alphas from global or similar regions. That’s why prod_correlation keeps showing up — your signals resemble the existing production pool.

To fix that, you’ll need to think orthogonally — build signals that capture unique timing, nonlinearities, or local behaviors in the Indian market.

To add on what has already been said,  **single dataset alphas** are having lower production correlation as compared to combining data-fields. Also creating these single dataset alphas using  **new  unique frameworks**  is helping yield lower production correlation

I also surprised to see the production correlation in newly added region  **INDIA.** Thank You consultants for sharing your experience.

I’ve also noticed that high prod correlation in IND often comes from overlapping global factors and shared datafields across regions. Exploring India-specific datasets or crafting single-dataset alphas with distinct structures really helps. It’s not just about new formulas but finding local market behaviors that global signals haven’t captured yet; that’s where lower prod correlation usually emerges.

Try coming up with atom ideas in INDIA

Production correlation in the INDIA region often arises because many core datafields—especially price, volume, and return-based ones—are globally standardized across regions. When alphas rely heavily on these shared inputs, overlap with existing production signals is inevitable. To reduce prod correlation, focus on region-specific datasets, explore unique operator combinations, or incorporate event-driven and liquidity-based factors. Emphasizing original signal construction and localized feature engineering can significantly improve distinctiveness and production viability.

Production correlation isn’t checked across regions. It’s region specific as far as i am aware. The reason we’re seeing high prod correlation in India is simply because the dataset coverage there is still limited, and many of the available fields are closely related. Naturally, most people end up building similar types of signals, so the overlap shows up as higher prod correlation. It’s less about cross-region similarity and more about everyone experimenting with the same small data pool.

Production correlation in India is tied to the region’s limited data universe, where many available fields are highly related, prompting researchers to produce similarly structured signals. Because core metrics like prices, volumes, and returns are uniform across markets, overlap with existing production alphas becomes more likely. To lower correlation, try incorporating India-specific datasets, unconventional operator patterns, and event- or liquidity-driven factors. More localized and creative feature design can noticeably improve uniqueness and production suitability.

### 评论 #14 (作者: AG14039, 时间: 6个月前)

Production correlation in India tends to be high because the market’s relatively narrow data universe forces researchers to rely on closely related fields, leading to signals that often resemble one another. With core inputs like prices, volumes, and returns being largely uniform across regions, it’s easy to overlap with existing production alphas. To reduce correlation, it helps to incorporate India-specific datasets, experiment with less common operator structures, and lean into event- or liquidity-oriented features. More localized and inventive signal construction generally results in greater distinctiveness and better production potential.

IND is a new region; the system has probably initialised it with production alphas drawn from global or closely related regions. That’s why  *prod_correlation*  keeps appearing — your signals are overlapping with the existing production set. To address this, you’ll need to think in more orthogonal terms and design signals that capture distinct timing patterns, nonlinear effects, or market-specific behaviours unique to India.

Prod correlation appears in the India region because even though the region is new, many consultants are building ideas using the same common signals, such as momentum, volume patterns, simple transforms, or popular rank and decay structures. When many people test similar logic at the same time, the results start moving in the same direction and the system flags that overlap as prod correlation. It does not depend on how long the region has existed, but on how similar the submitted alphas are to each other. So even in a new region, if many ideas follow familiar structures, correlation builds up quickly.

High production correlation often arises because some data fields are shared across regions. For instance, price-volume returns are effectively identical in every market, so using similar datasets as in other regions naturally increases correlation with existing production alphas. In the IND universe, even though it is new, the system may already include seeded alphas from global or comparable regions, which explains why prod_correlation appears higher than expected. To reduce correlation, it’s important to generate truly orthogonal ideas—signals that leverage unique local behaviors, timing patterns, or nonlinear relationships specific to India. Exploring data fields newly introduced for the IND region can also help, as these typically have very low correlation with the existing pool. How do you approach designing alphas that are genuinely orthogonal to seeded or cross-region signals?

High production correlation often appears because many core data fields, such as prices, volumes, and returns, are effectively shared across regions. As a result, alphas built on these inputs naturally resemble existing production signals, even in a newer universe like IND. Although the region is new, the system typically includes seeded or transferred alphas from global or comparable markets, which can drive higher-than-expected prod correlation. Reducing this overlap requires deliberately targeting orthogonality by focusing on India-specific behaviors, unique timing effects, or nonlinear constructions that differ from standard price–volume logic. Leveraging newly introduced IND datasets is especially helpful, as they tend to have minimal overlap with the existing pool. More creative operator sequencing and localized intuition generally lead to lower correlation and stronger differentiation in production.

This is expected in IND. Even though the region is new, many contributors are porting similar global or ASI ideas, so production correlation shows up quickly due to overlapping logic and datasets.

Prod correlation is calculated per region, not across regions. In India, the higher prod correlation mainly comes from limited dataset coverage, which pushes many researchers to build similar signals from the same fields, leading to natural overlap.
