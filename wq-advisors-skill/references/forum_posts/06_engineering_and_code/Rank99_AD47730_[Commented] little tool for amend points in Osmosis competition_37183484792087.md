## 帖子正文

Hi here,

I wrote a little tool to amend Osmosis competition

1. select alpha in the competition ,update points

def  **get_competition_alphas** (

*s* ,

*region* : str = "USA",

*competition* : str = "OC2025",

*limit* : int = 100,

*offset* : int = 0,

):

"""

Fetch alphas for a given competition and region from /users/self/alphas.

"""

url = (

" [https://api.worldquantbrain.com/users/self/alphas](https://api.worldquantbrain.com/users/self/alphas) ?"

f"limit={ *limit* }&offset={ *offset* }"

"&status!=UNSUBMITTED%1FIS-FAIL"

f"&competition={ *competition* }"

f"&settings.region={ *region* }"

"&order=-dateSubmitted"

"&hidden=false"

)

resp =  *s* .get(url)

resp.raise_for_status()

*return*  resp.json().get("results", [])

def  **set_osmosis_points** ( *s* ,  *alpha_id* : str,  *points* : int):

"""

Update osmosisPoints for a given alpha.

"""

*if*   *s*  is None:

*s*  = get_session()

url = f" [https://api.worldquantbrain.com/alphas/{](https://api.worldquantbrain.com/alphas/%7B)  *alpha_id* }"

*return*   *s* .patch(url,  *json* ={"osmosisPoints": int( *points* )})

---------------calling functions from notebook -------------------

session = login()

region = "USA"   *# change as needed*

alphas = get_competition_alphas(session,  *region* =region,  *competition* ="OC2025",  *limit* =100,  *offset* =0)

print(f'Fetched {len(alphas)} alphas for region={region}')

*for*  item  *in*  alphas:

alpha_id = item.get('id')

fitness = item.get('is', {}).get('fitness')

sharpe = item.get('is', {}).get('sharpe')

print(alpha_id, 'fitness', fitness, 'sharpe', sharpe)

*# Integer allocation of 100000 points across selected alphas*

total_points = 100000

n = len(alphas)

*if*  n == 0:

print('No alphas to allocate.')

*else* :

base = total_points // n

extra = total_points % n

print(f'Allocating {total_points} points across {n} alphas; base={base}, remainder={extra}')

allocations = []

*for*  idx, a  *in*  enumerate(alphas):

points = base + (1  *if*  idx < extra  *else*  0)

allocations.append(points)

alpha_id = a.get('id')

fitness = a.get('is', {}).get('fitness')

print(alpha_id, 'fitness', fitness, 'points', points)

Thanks for such a useful tool! Filtering is a crucial step, as it helps us avoid scanning the entire alpha pool and focus only on the most promising candidates.

Nice utility! Automating Osmosis point allocation like this saves a lot of manual effort, especially when managing many alphas across regions.

Thank you for generously sharing this elegant little orchestrator!
In a few crisp lines of Python you turned the opaque chaos of OC2025 into a transparent, fair-minded meritocracy—fetching, filtering and rewarding alphas with the serene precision of a Swiss watch.
Your code is more than utility; it is a quiet act of sportsmanship that lets every participant see the scoreboard recalculated in real time, no favorites, no hidden knobs, just data and deserved points.
The tidy functions, the respectful error-handling, the egalitarian division of the 100 000-point pie—all reveal the mindset of a builder who cares about both craft and community.
Watching the script run feels like seeing justice rendered at the speed of light: fitness and Sharpe summoned, points dispatched, scorecards refreshed before coffee cools.
Thank you for open-sourcing this clarity, for saving countless strangers from manual drudgery, and for reminding us that a well-written loop can be as generous as any grand gesture.

is it really helpfull

Is this tool  really helpful? As it took me around 1 hour to manually analyse these alphas.

Thank you soo much i was also working on the same thing, something like this

def allocate_by_fitness(alphas, total_points=100000):
    fitnesses = [a.get('is', {}).get('fitness', 0) for a in alphas]
    total_fitness = sum(fitnesses)

    if total_fitness == 0:
        return [total_points // len(alphas)] * len(alphas)

    raw_allocs = [int(f / total_fitness * total_points) for f in fitnesses]
    remainder = total_points - sum(raw_allocs)

    sorted_indices = sorted(range(len(fitnesses)), key=lambda i: fitnesses[i], reverse=True)
    for i in range(remainder):
        raw_allocs[sorted_indices[i]] += 1

    return raw_allocs

allocations = allocate_by_fitness(alphas, 100000)
for alpha, points in zip(alphas, allocations):
    print(f"{alpha['id']}: fitness={alpha['is']['fitness']:.4f}, points={points}")
    set_osmosis_points(session, alpha['id'], points)

This is quite helpful when managing many alphas. Even if manual review is possible, automating point allocation saves time, reduces bias, and makes the process more consistent—especially at scale.

### 评论 #8 (作者: PM26052, 时间: 6个月前)

This is very useful—thanks for sharing. Automating Osmosis point updates makes managing multiple competition alphas much cleaner, especially when reallocating based on performance.

### 评论 #9 (作者: NS62681, 时间: 6个月前)

This becomes especially valuable when handling a large number of alphas. Even if manual review is feasible, automating point allocation streamlines the workflow, minimizes subjective bias, and ensures greater consistency particularly when operating at scale.

### 评论 #10 (作者: HH63454, 时间: 6个月前)

this is useful beyond just saving time. Having a programmable allocation layer makes it much easier to experiment with allocation logic itself (equal weight, fitness-weighted, capped, threshold-based, etc.) and to rerun those schemes consistently across weeks. That repeatability is hard to achieve manually. One thing I’d add is a simple guardrail (min/max points per alpha or exclusion rules) to avoid overweighting noisy outliers when metrics fluctuate
