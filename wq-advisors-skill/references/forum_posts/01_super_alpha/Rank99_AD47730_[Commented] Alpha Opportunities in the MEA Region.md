The MEA (Middle East & Africa) region is one of the most underrated research spaces on BRAIN. Unlike larger universes, MEA offers a unique mix of Middle Eastern and North African market exposures, creating opportunities for signals that behave very differently from US, EU, or APAC regions.

A few interesting observations while working with MEA:

The TOP300 universe contains only ~300 stocks
This makes the region highly capacity-sensitive and liquidity-aware. Even a strong Alpha can struggle if it over-concentrates in illiquid names.

Higher-turnover datasets seem more effective
Datasets with frequent updates such as:
• Price-Volume
• Analyst data
• Other high-refresh datasets from BRAIN Labs

can work surprisingly well here. Around ~20% turnover can still be acceptable if margins justify trading costs.

Neutralization matters a lot
Starting with Market Neutralization is useful, but adding Sector + Country neutralization often improves robustness significantly.

Visualization mode is extremely useful in MEA
Turning Visualization = ON helps inspect:
 Country exposure
Average size by capitalization
 Liquidity concentration

This is especially important in smaller universes where unintended exposure can dominate results.

Robustness testing is essential
Testing pre-2018 vs post-2018 behavior helped me understand whether the Alpha was exploiting structural effects or temporary market conditions.

One thing I’m learning continuously: MEA rewards diversity in signals. Pure price-volume patterns alone often become fragile. Combining them with analyst or fundamental information can create much stronger and more stable Alphas.

Curious to hear from other researchers:
What datasets or neutralization combinations have worked best for you in MEA? 🚀

Strong observations on MEA — especially on capacity constraints and liquidity sensitivity.

One additional angle I’ve found important is that MEA behaves less like a single “region” and more like a collection of fragmented micro-markets. Because of that, cross-sectional structure tends to dominate over time-series structure more often than in US/EU universes.

On neutralization, I’ve seen Market + Country work well as a baseline, but adding Sector can sometimes over-constrain the signal in already thin universes like TOP300. In those cases, the trade-off between purity and signal decay becomes more visible, especially when turnover is already elevated.

Agree on robustness testing — pre/post regime splits (especially around 2016–2018 liquidity shifts) often reveal whether an alpha is genuinely structural or just exploiting a transient microstructure effect.

Curious as well — have you noticed any consistent degradation patterns when moving from TOP300 to broader MEA extensions, or do certain dataset families remain stable across both?

Good Observation! Happy Research.

#### **Completely agree — MEA extensions often expose whether a signal is truly structural or just dependent on concentrated liquidity pockets within TOP300. I’ve noticed alternative/fundamental dataset families tend to remain more stable, while short-horizon price-action signals usually degrade faster as breadth expands.**

I agree that pure price-volume can be fragile. It may work, but I’d rather use it with analyst or fundamental signals as confirmation. In MEA, a decent alpha is often less about being clever and more about not letting one hidden exposure drive the whole result.

Unutilised region so we can make alpha faster in this region.

Well, tried out my code research in this new region and the results are good.

In addition, the small in the number of stocks (300,400) results in very fast simulations

What datasets or neutralization combinations have worked best for you in MEA - For me analyst data set and fundamental in both top300 and top400 universe and country region neutralisation.

Thanks for sharing these helpful tips. The combination of  **analyst, fundamental, and price-volume signals**  sounds like a promising approach for improving robustness.

The TOP300 capacity constraint is the defining characteristic that shapes everything else about MEA alpha construction. With only 300 names the cross-sectional power of your ranking is inherently limited — you have fewer independent bets than in GLB or USA which means signal noise affects your IC estimates more than in larger universes
