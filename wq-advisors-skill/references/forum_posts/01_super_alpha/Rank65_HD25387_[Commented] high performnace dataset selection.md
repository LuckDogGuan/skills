## 帖子正文

Historically, price/volume-derived datasets (fundamentals, technical factors, and model signals) have shown consistent out-of-sample performance. But in recent years, less explored datasets like  **alternative sentiment feeds, news flow analytics, option-implied risk metrics, and supply chain signals**  have shown strong potential, especially when integrated with traditional features. The key is not the dataset alone, but how it’s  **normalized, orthogonalized, and combined**  to reduce redundancy and capture unique market structure.

Các tập dữ liệu tiềm năng mà bạn đề cập khá tốt nhưng tôi thấy rất khó để triển khai thành ý tưởng. Bạn có kinh nghiệm gì không?

Thanks for sharing! The idea of integrating alternative datasets with traditional features is inspiring—I’ll try it out.

Totally agree — alternative datasets add value only when properly normalized and de-correlated. I’ve found hybrid approaches (mixing traditional + alternative signals) often yield more stable performance.

In my opinion, out of sample results we couldn't know at the moment. But we can optimize our in-sample result first! Anyone has other point of view?

Hi, I think you’re absolutely right that the real edge doesn’t come simply from sourcing an alternative dataset, but from how it’s processed and integrated with existing features. In my own experiments, I’ve noticed that raw sentiment or supply chain signals can be very noisy, and without proper normalization they often just add volatility to the model rather than predictive power. Orthogonalization is especially important since many of these “new” datasets end up overlapping with traditional factors more than we realize. One approach I’m considering is to first test each dataset’s incremental contribution to predictive accuracy after controlling for a baseline of price/volume and fundamentals. That way, I can filter out signals that don’t add unique value. I’m curious if others here have experimented with ensemble methods where alternative datasets are weighted adaptively depending on their performance stability across different regimes.

High-performing alphas often come from  **traditional price/volume-based datasets** , but recently  **alternative sources**  like sentiment, news flow, option-implied risk, and supply chain data have added strong value. The real edge comes from how these datasets are  **normalized, orthogonalized, and combined**  to reduce redundancy and capture unique signals

Yeah that shift makes sense—traditional price/volume still works but the real edge now often comes from mixing in those newer datasets. The trick is making sure they aren’t just noisy add-ons, so normalization and orthogonalization become crucial. When done right, they layer on unique structure without overlapping too much with the old signals, which is where the real performance boost shows up.

Totally agree with the points raised here — the “secret sauce” isn’t just finding exotic datasets, but how you engineer and blend them with the traditional ones. In my experience, even a noisy alt dataset can become valuable once you normalize it properly and strip away the redundant correlations. What’s interesting is that sometimes the incremental edge doesn’t show up in headline performance right away, but rather in reduced drawdowns or better regime adaptability. Has anyone here tried systematically testing regime-dependent weighting (e.g., giving more weight to sentiment during volatile markets and to fundamentals in stable periods)? That might be a way to unlock more consistent alpha from these newer sources.

High-performing signals have long been built on traditional price and volume data. More recently, alternative datasets ranging from sentiment and news flow to option-implied measures of risk and even supply chain information have proven highly valuable. What truly drives performance, though, is not just the choice of dataset but the process of normalizing, orthogonalizing, and blending them to minimize overlap and extract distinct, non-redundant signals.

Absolutely! I agree that the true advantage comes from how alternative datasets are processed and combined with existing features, not merely from having them. Raw signals like sentiment or supply chain data can be noisy, and without proper normalization, they may just introduce volatility rather than meaningful predictive power. Orthogonalization is key since many new datasets overlap with traditional factors more than expected. One effective approach is to evaluate each dataset’s incremental contribution to predictive accuracy after controlling for baseline price, volume, and fundamental factors—filtering out signals that don’t add unique value. I’m also curious if others have tried ensemble methods that adaptively weight alternative datasets based on their stability and performance across different market regimes.

This is a really valuable discussion because dataset selection often gets framed as “old vs. new,” when in reality the edge comes from  *integration* . Traditional price/volume features remain the backbone of many stable alphas, but alternative datasets—sentiment feeds, supply chain indicators, option-implied measures—can add orthogonal signals if processed carefully. The challenge is that these alternative datasets are usually noisier and may overlap with existing factors more than expected. That’s why  **normalization, winsorization, and orthogonalization**  are critical steps before combining them. A good workflow is to benchmark every alternative dataset against a baseline (price/volume + fundamentals) and measure its  *incremental contribution*  to predictive accuracy, Sharpe, and drawdown reduction. I’ve also seen success with  **regime-dependent weighting** , where sentiment carries more weight in volatile periods while fundamentals dominate in calmer markets. This not only diversifies signals but also makes the alpha more adaptive to changing market structures.

The key isn’t just exotic datasets, but how they’re engineered and combined with traditional data. Normalization and correlation reduction can turn noisy data into consistent alpha, especially when weighting adapts to market regimes.

Absolutely—true edge comes from processing and integrating alternative datasets, not just sourcing them. Raw signals can be noisy, so normalization and orthogonalization are key. Testing incremental predictive value and adaptive weighting across regimes helps filter meaningful contributions.

This is a well-articulated insight into the evolution of financial datasets. It clearly highlights that while traditional price and volume-based features have proven reliable, alternative datasets—like sentiment feeds, news analytics, option-implied metrics, and supply chain signals—offer significant untapped potential. The emphasis on proper normalization, orthogonalization, and integration is crucial, as the value lies not just in adding more data, but in ensuring it contributes unique, non-redundant information. This approach can uncover subtle market structures and improve model robustness. Overall, it’s an excellent reminder that thoughtful preprocessing and feature engineering are just as important as sourcing new datasets.
