Hi everyone — I’ve been a bit lazy😭 lately and haven’t participated in OSMOSIS. But I’m curious: what does the updated  **Combo IR Rank**  in OSMOSIS mean? Is it the same metric as the final  **OS Score** , or just a related indicator? I’ve also heard that OSMOSIS deducts trading costs. (JZC)

Hey! The updated  **Combo IR Rank**  in OSMOSIS is related to, but not the same as, the final OS Score. It’s essentially a composite measure of your alpha’s  **risk-adjusted performance** , combining information ratio (IR) signals across multiple dimensions (like sectors or universes) to give a relative ranking of how strong your submissions are. Think of it as an  **intermediate ranking metric**  that helps you gauge performance before costs and other portfolio constraints are fully applied.

You’re correct about trading costs: OSMOSIS factors in  **transaction costs and turnover**  when calculating the final OS Score, so your post-cost performance may differ from what Combo IR alone suggests. In short, the Combo IR Rank shows how robust your alpha is  **pre-cost** , while the OS Score reflects the fully realistic, deployable performance. However, you can try to get more information about the same, since I'm not entirely sure, but I myself am already in the competition!

Combo IR Rank in WorldQuant Osmosis measures how consistently an alpha performs across multiple evaluation periods and metrics. It aggregates Information Ratio ranks from different tests, rewarding alphas with stable, repeatable performance rather than high but volatile returns.

[顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)](/hc/en-us/profiles/25468856195607-顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44))  Thanks for the clarification! So Combo IR Rank is more like an intermediate health check of the combo, while the final OS Score reflects a more realistic, post-cost performance with investability and other constraints applied — closer to the true economic meaning of the alpha than just PnL. That helps a lot — appreciate the insight! (JZC)

Think of  **Combo IR Rank**  as a  *stability-weighted skill score* . It aggregates IR ranks across tests/time slices to reward consistency and robustness, mostly  **pre full-cost reality** . The  **OS Score**  is the economic truth — post costs, turnover, and investability. A high Combo IR with weak OS usually flags cost or capacity issues.

Combo IR Rank is basically a relative ranking of your alphas’ combined IR within the Osmosis cohort, not the final OS Score itself. It’s more like a signal quality indicator. The final OS Score layers in more things, including allocation effects and trading cost adjustments, so they’re related but not identical.

Reading through this thread actually cleared up some of the confusion I had around Combo IR Rank. I used to instinctively treat it like a “mini final score,” but now it feels more like a signal-quality thermometer than a verdict. It tells you whether the combo is behaving in a stable, repeatable way before all the real-world frictions are applied.

What I find useful is the separation of roles: Combo IR Rank gives a sense of structural health, while the final OS Score is where reality really kicks in — costs, turnover, and execution constraints. Seeing both together makes more sense than trying to read too much into either one alone.

Overall, it feels less like redundant metrics and more like different lenses on the same portfolio, each answering a slightly different question.

That’s a good way to frame it. Combo IR Rank is best thought of as a stability-weighted skill indicator. It aggregates information ratio ranks across multiple tests and time slices, which means it mainly rewards consistency, repeatability, and robustness in a relatively “clean” evaluation setting, often before the full impact of costs and execution constraints. In contrast, the OS Score reflects economic reality. It incorporates turnover, costs, and investability, and therefore answers the question of whether the alpha actually survives once frictions are applied. When you see a high Combo IR Rank paired with a weak OS Score, it usually signals that the idea has genuine predictive structure but struggles with capacity, turnover, or cost sensitivity. That gap is often a cue to focus on smoothing, decay, universe refinement, or exposure control rather than abandoning the underlying intuition.

**Combo IR Rank**  measures the  **Information Ratio of the combined alpha portfolio** , accounting for correlation, weighting, and  **trading costs** . It is  **not identical to the final OS Score** , but a closely related indicator used during the competition to assess combo quality and robustness. Because OSMOSIS deducts trading costs, Combo IR Rank tends to better reflect  **realistic, deployable performance**  rather than raw Sharpe alone.

Combo IR Rank is a composite metric that evaluates your alpha portfolio's information ratio adjusted for diversification and stability, different from the final OS Score which is your overall standing. OSMOSIS does incorporate realistic trading costs including turnover penalties and friction, making it closer to production conditions than standard simulations. This means high-turnover alphas get penalized more heavily than in regular backtests. The ranking reflects how your portfolio performs after these costs relative to others. Are you seeing different alpha performance in OSMOSIS versus standard sims?

Combo IR Rank shows how your alphas’ combined IR ranks within the cohort, acting as a signal quality measure. The final OS Score includes extra factors like allocation and trading costs, making the two metrics similar but distinct.
