## 帖子正文

Recently, while exploring new data, I often encounter this error (other IS criteria are passed):
 *"IS ladder Sharpe of 0.15 is below the cutoff of 1.58 for ladder year 2: 7/15/2022…7/16/2020."*

I’m seeking advice on how to pass this condition without having to change the Datafield or Dataset.

ou're using operators like max and min, as they can be very effective in many situations for smoothing performance metrics. However, as you've pointed out, this approach may not be suitable for Alphas with low data volatility, which presents a unique challenge. The IS Ladder Sharpe cutoff might vary slightly due to region-specific adjustments or dataset differences. Ensure your alpha is properly neutralized for market and sector biases in ASI and GLB regions. Validate with region-focused backtests to confirm Sharpe alignment and check if transaction costs or scaling distort calculations.

**Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)**  models are used to capture volatility clustering, where periods of high volatility tend to be followed by more high volatility. GARCH models estimate the conditional variance of the returns, which can be used to forecast future risk levels.

[KP26017](/hc/en-us/profiles/14992337006103-KP26017)  Thank you for sharing, but the IS ladder Sharpe error I'm encountering is not when I use the min and max operators.

I'm also experiencing it with DFs in both the Dataset Model and News, where data volatility is not low.

[ND68030](/hc/en-us/profiles/9496734822295-ND68030)  I've noticed that you're not responding to the correct topic.

The GARCH you mentioned sounds academic, but it's not actually relevant to the question I'm asking. 
You need to reconsider whether you're commenting on the wrong post.

Hi, please submit the alpha using a single dataset with minimal data and operators. Fix the IS Sharpe error for 2 years. Improve Sharpe by diversifying low-correlation alphas, avoiding signal decay, fine-tuning parameters, using longer lookbacks, and refreshing data regularly.

- **Market Data** : Familiarize yourself with market data providers (e.g.,  **Yahoo Finance** ,  **Quandl** ,  **Alpha Vantage** ,  **Bloomberg** ). Learn how to access, clean, and structure financial data for analysis.
- **Data Wrangling** : Being able to clean and preprocess data (removing missing values, handling outliers, etc.) is an essential skill. In Python, you can use libraries like  **Pandas**  for these tasks.

[NT63388](/hc/en-us/profiles/6348096761239-NT63388)  hi, in my opinion your question is quite difficult to solve because low IS ladder sharpe is because your alpha idea is not working in recent years. So the only answer I can give is to add more operators to your alpha to improve your alpha idea. I think nesting more operators trade_when, if_else, group_ope might help you.

The overall volatility (or risk) of the SuperAlpha can be lower than the sum of the individual volatilities, especially if the Alphas are not perfectly correlated (i.e., their returns don’t move in the same direction at the same time).

I also encountered the same situation as you. Usually, the Sharpe ratio in the last few years of the data is quite low. I tried changing some function samples, but it only produced a small number of alphas. Therefore, I chose to combine this dataset with some other datasets, even though this approach is not ideal.

**Earnings Surprises and Delayed Price Adjustments** : The hypothesis that stocks with strong earnings momentum post-announcement continue to exhibit positive or negative drift is well-supported in empirical research. Often, earnings surprises are initially underpriced or overvalued by the market, leading to delayed price adjustments.

**Social Media Sentiment Scores** : Real-time tracking of sentiment allows the identification of changes in public opinion, which could prompt preemptive actions. Quantitative models could link these sentiment scores to price movement patterns, providing early warning signs of potential market volatility.

I faced the same issue with a low Sharpe ratio in recent years. Adjusting function samples yielded few alphas, so I combined this dataset with others, despite its limitations.

Hi  [NT63388](/hc/en-us/profiles/6348096761239-NT63388) , here's my suggestion. 
First, experiment with different  **neutralizations, decay, and truncation**  to fine-tune your alpha. If your alpha includes a  **lookback period** , try both reducing and increasing it while noting performance changes. Additionally, substituting and modifying  **operators**  can help enhance the  **in-sample (IS) ladder Sharpe**  for better robustness

It sounds like you're dealing with a situation where the Sharpe ratio for a specific ladder year is falling below the required threshold. Have you considered adjusting the time window or applying additional smoothing techniques to reduce noise and possibly improve the Sharpe ratio? What strategies have you tried so far to enhance the Sharpe ratio?

### 评论 #16 (作者: NP85445, 时间: 1年前)

I recommend experimenting with different neutralizations, decay settings, and truncation adjustments to fine-tune your alpha. Try varying the lookback period—both shorter and longer—to see how it impacts performance. Additionally, using a single dataset with minimal operators can reduce noise. While combining datasets might help, it’s less ideal. Continuous parameter tuning and regular data refreshes are key to boosting your IS ladder Sharpe for robust performance.

1. Try adding more operators and data fields to your alpha. If your IS ladder Sharpe is low, it could mean your alpha idea isn’t working well with recent market trends. It might be time to rethink the concept and make it stand out from older ideas.
2. Play around with the settings—things like decay, neutralization, or other parameters. Even small tweaks here can sometimes make a big difference.
3. Change up the main operator in your alpha. For example, if you’re relying on  `ts_rank` , try experimenting with other time-series operators to see if you get better results.

And don’t hesitate to drop an alpha if it’s just not working. At the end of the day, getting a high IS ladder Sharpe should be your top priority. WorldQuant’s minimum of 1.58 is fine, but aiming higher is always better!

Submit the alpha with one dataset, minimal data, and operators.  Boost Sharpe by diversifying low-correlation alphas, avoiding decay, tuning parameters, and updating data regularly.

It sounds like you’re facing a common challenge when dealing with performance metrics. Have you considered adjusting your strategy for risk management or diversifying the assets in your ladder? Sometimes, refining the underlying models can also provide better outcomes without needing to change critical datasets. Would love to hear more about the specific approaches you’ve tried!

Operators like max and min are useful for smoothing performance metrics but may not work well with Alphas of low data volatility. The IS Ladder Sharpe cutoff can vary by region or dataset, so ensure your alpha is neutralized for market and sector biases in ASI and GLB regions. Validate with region-specific backtests and account for transaction costs or scaling distortions
