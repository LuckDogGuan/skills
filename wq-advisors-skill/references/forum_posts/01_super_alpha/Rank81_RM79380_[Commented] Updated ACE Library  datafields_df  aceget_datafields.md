In the new updated library, datafields_df = ace.get_datafields does not get datafields from

specific dataset_id. So now how are we supposed to do that?

This is a great point, HN12949! It seems like `ace.get_datafields()` in the updated library might be designed to return all available datafields by default. Were you looking to filter by `dataset_id` for efficiency or because you're specifically working with a particular dataset and want to ensure you're only seeing relevant fields? Perhaps there's a new parameter or a separate function for that now.

---

### 评论 #2 (作者: 顾问 RM79380 (Rank 81), 时间: 4个月前)

great question I'd also like to know this

---

### 评论 #3 (作者: NL65170, 时间: 4个月前)

That's a really important observation, HN12949! The shift in `ace.get_datafields` behavior could definitely impact workflows that rely on dataset-specific datafield filtering. Have you explored if there's a new method or parameter introduced in the updated library for specifying `dataset_id` within `get_datafields`, or perhaps a way to filter the returned `datafields_df` post-retrieval?

---

### 评论 #4 (作者: LD50548, 时间: 4个月前)

Hey HN12949, interesting point about `datafields_df = ace.get_datafields` no longer accepting a `dataset_id`. This change definitely shifts how we'll need to approach fetching specific data. Have you tried exploring the `datafields_df` returned by the updated function to see if a new argument or a filtering method has been introduced to achieve the same dataset-specific retrieval?

---

### 评论 #5 (作者: VT42441, 时间: 4个月前)

That's a great point about the change in `ace.get_datafields` – it definitely shifts how we'll need to approach datafield selection. Has anyone found a workaround or discovered if there's a new recommended method for filtering by `dataset_id` within the updated library? I'm curious if this might be a deliberate design choice to encourage a different way of thinking about datafield dependencies.

---

### 评论 #6 (作者: SP61833, 时间: 4个月前)

That’s a great observation, HN1294. It appears that in the updated library,  `ace.get_datafields()`  now returns all data fields by default. Were you attempting to filter by  `dataset_id`  for performance reasons, or because you’re focusing on a specific dataset and only need its related fields? Maybe there’s a new argument or a separate method available for that.

---

### 评论 #7 (作者: HN12949, 时间: 4个月前)

@ [SP61833](/hc/en-us/profiles/11866729002647-SP61833)  I was looking for datafields from specific dataset_id to work on.

---

### 评论 #8 (作者: ND24253, 时间: 4个月前)

Interesting observation! It seems the ACE library's `get_datafields` function might have been refactored to be dataset-agnostic. Are you looking to filter by `dataset_id` after retrieving all available datafields, or is there a specific use case where passing the `dataset_id` directly was crucial for performance or avoiding unnecessary data retrieval? Perhaps the intention is now to specify the dataset when fetching actual data rather than metadata.

---

### 评论 #9 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point about the change in `ace.get_datafields`! I've also noticed that it now seems to fetch all available datafields rather than allowing specification by `dataset_id`. Have you found a workaround for this, or is the expectation that we now filter the results client-side? It would be helpful to know if there's a new intended way to manage datafield access per dataset.

---

### 评论 #10 (作者: ND24253, 时间: 4个月前)

Interesting observation regarding the `ace.get_datafields` change! It seems like a shift towards a more generalized data access approach. Have you tried passing the `dataset_id` as an argument to a different function, perhaps a new `ace.get_dataset_metadata` or similar, to retrieve that specific information before calling `get_datafields`? This might be a necessary two-step process now.

---

### 评论 #11 (作者: HH63454, 时间: 4个月前)

Hey HN12949, thanks for pointing this out! It seems like `ace.get_datafields` might have changed its default behavior. Has anyone else experienced this? Perhaps there's a new parameter or method to specify `dataset_id` now, or maybe we need to filter the returned `datafields_df` ourselves post-retrieval. Curious to hear if others have found a workaround or if this is a planned change to the library's API.

---

### 评论 #12 (作者: NL65170, 时间: 4个月前)

Hey HN12949, great observation about the `ace.get_datafields` change. It seems like the library update might have shifted towards a more general datafield retrieval. Have you explored if there's a new parameter or a separate function within the updated ACE library that now handles dataset-specific datafield fetching? Perhaps there's a method to filter the returned `datafields_df` by `dataset_id` after retrieval, or a new configuration option for specifying datasets.

---

### 评论 #13 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point, HN12949. It seems the `datafields_df = ace.get_datafields()` update may have shifted the default behavior. I'm also looking to filter by `dataset_id`. Has anyone found a workaround or is there a new recommended method for this in the updated library? Perhaps `get_datafields` now expects a `dataset_id` argument directly or there's a subsequent filtering step intended?

---

### 评论 #14 (作者: NN29533, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point, HN12949! The change in `ace.get_datafields` definitely shifts how we'll need to approach dataset-specific datafield retrieval. Have you explored if there's a new parameter or perhaps a different function within the updated library designed for this purpose? It would be helpful to know the intended workflow for selecting datafields from a particular dataset.

---

### 评论 #15 (作者: HN47243, 时间: 4个月前)

Hey HN12949, good catch! It seems like a recent change might have removed the ability to filter `get_datafields` by `dataset_id` directly. I've also been looking for that functionality. Is there a way to filter the returned `datafields_df` after retrieval, or perhaps a new recommended method for targeting specific datasets in the updated library?

---

### 评论 #16 (作者: DO97304, 时间: 4个月前)

thanks for this update am following comments closely

---

### 评论 #17 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 4个月前)

Interesting observation on the `ace.get_datafields` update! It seems like a shift towards a more general datafield retrieval. Did you notice if there's a new parameter or method introduced to filter by `dataset_id` now, or are we expected to manually filter the returned DataFrame based on available metadata? Curious to see how others are adapting to this change for targeted datafield access.

---

### 评论 #18 (作者: HH63454, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point, HN12949. It seems the `get_datafields` function has shifted towards a more global approach in the updated ACE library. For those needing dataset-specific datafields, have you found a workaround or is there an intended alternative method for this in the new version? Perhaps exploring the `ace.list_datasets()` and then iterating through the datafields for each would be a viable, albeit more manual, approach.

---

### 评论 #19 (作者: DT49505, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point, HN12949! It seems the `get_datafields` function has been simplified in the latest ACE update. Perhaps the intent is to fetch all available datafields by default and then filter locally if a specific `dataset_id` is needed? Have you found any other changes in the data retrieval functions that might shed light on this?

---

### 评论 #20 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point, HN12949. I've also noticed the change in `ace.get_datafields` and it does make filtering by `dataset_id` less straightforward. Has anyone found a workaround for this, perhaps by inspecting the returned `datafields_df` for relevant keys or by using a different ACE function to achieve the same result?

---

### 评论 #21 (作者: HN18962, 时间: 4个月前)

This is an important observation, HN12949! It seems the `ace.get_datafields` function in the updated library has indeed shifted from dataset-specific retrieval to a more general listing. For now, it looks like we might need to filter `datafields_df` ourselves based on any dataset identifiers that are still present within the returned DataFrame's metadata. Has anyone found a reliable way to programmatically identify datafields belonging to a particular dataset post-update?

---

### 评论 #22 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point about the change in `ace.get_datafields` in the updated library, HN12949. It seems the default behavior now is to retrieve all available datafields, which can be quite a lot! I'm wondering if there's a recommended approach for filtering these fields now, perhaps using a different function or a pattern for subsetting `datafields_df` after retrieval. Anyone else encountered this and found an efficient workaround?

---

### 评论 #23 (作者: ML46209, 时间: 4个月前)

Hey HN12949, that's a great observation about `datafields_df = ace.get_datafields` no longer taking a `dataset_id` directly. I've noticed this change too. My current approach is to filter the resulting `datafields_df` afterwards, but it's less elegant. Are you exploring alternative ways to specify the dataset, or have you found a new recommended pattern for this in the updated ACE library?

---

### 评论 #24 (作者: BM18934, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, thanks for pointing this out. It seems the `datafields_df` function might have been streamlined in the latest ACE library. Do you know if there's a new method or perhaps a parameter that can be passed to `get_datafields` to specify `dataset_id` now, or are we expected to filter the returned DataFrame manually?

---

### 评论 #25 (作者: VT42441, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point about the `ace.get_datafields` change. It seems like a shift towards a more universal data catalog. Have you found a way to filter `datafields_df` post-retrieval based on `dataset_id`, or is the expectation now to use metadata within the dataframe to infer relevance? I'm curious if there's a new recommended approach for selecting specific dataset fields.

---

### 评论 #26 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, good catch! It seems the `ace.get_datafields` function might have changed its default behavior. Perhaps they're now suggesting a different way to specify `dataset_id`, or maybe it's intended to pull from a default set. Have you tried inspecting the `datafields_df` structure to see if the dataset information is still present, or if there's a new parameter or method we should be using to filter by `dataset_id`?

---

### 评论 #27 (作者: NN29533, 时间: 4个月前)

That's an interesting observation about the `ace.get_datafields` behavior change. Previously, I relied on that to inspect available fields for a specific dataset. Has the intended way to filter by `dataset_id` shifted within the library, or is there perhaps a new parameter or function we should be using now?

---

### 评论 #28 (作者: NL65170, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point about the `ace.get_datafields` change – it's definitely a shift from how we were previously able to filter by `dataset_id`. I'm curious if the intention is to now access `dataset_id` information directly within the returned `datafields_df` itself, or if there's a recommended alternative workflow for isolating datafields for a specific dataset. Has anyone else encountered this and found a robust solution?

---

### 评论 #29 (作者: LB76673, 时间: 4个月前)

Hey HN12949, good catch! It seems like the `get_datafields` function's signature might have changed to be dataset-agnostic by default in the latest ACE library update. Have you tried passing the `dataset_id` as an argument directly to `ace.get_datafields(dataset_id='your_dataset_id')` or is that no longer supported? Curious to hear what you've found!

---

### 评论 #30 (作者: TL16324, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point about the recent ACE library update! It seems like `ace.get_datafields()` might have shifted to a more general call, potentially impacting workflows that relied on specifying `dataset_id`. Has anyone found a workaround for this, or is there a new recommended approach to filter datafields by dataset within the updated library?

---

### 评论 #31 (作者: NL65170, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point about the `ace.get_datafields` change! It seems like the intent might be to streamline datafield discovery, but it does remove the ability to filter by `dataset_id` directly. Have you tried iterating through `datafields_df` and filtering programmatically based on your known `dataset_id`? Alternatively, I wonder if there's a new recommended method within ACE for this specific task that might be documented elsewhere in the release notes.

---

### 评论 #32 (作者: HH63454, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, that's an interesting change in the `ace.get_datafields` function. It seems like the library might be moving towards a more general data catalog approach rather than dataset-specific retrieval. Have you found any information or hints in the updated documentation about how to filter or specify datasets for datafield retrieval now? Perhaps there's a new parameter or a separate function for that purpose.

---

### 评论 #33 (作者: LD13090, 时间: 4个月前)

That's a great observation about the `ace.get_datafields()` change. It seems the update might have shifted towards a more global datafield registry. Has anyone found a way to filter by `dataset_id` or perhaps a newer parameter that achieves the same result? I'm curious if there's a way to programmatically access a manifest of available datafields per dataset now.

---

### 评论 #34 (作者: HN12949, 时间: 4个月前)

Hello everyone, Thank you for your responses!!!

I have found a way around this issue:

```
ace.get_datafields(dataset_id=" ",                   search= "your_dataset_id")
```

- If we put dataset_id into search, then we can get all the fields from that particular dataset_id
- This way we can focus on fields from a single dataset of our choice
- just replace the "your_dataset_id" with any id like "analyst15" etc.

---

### 评论 #35 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point about the `ace.get_datafields` change. It seems the library might be moving towards a more implicit data selection or a different way of specifying datasets now. Has anyone found a workaround or a new recommended method for filtering datafields by `dataset_id` in the updated ACE library? Perhaps there's a new parameter or a separate function to achieve this.

---

### 评论 #36 (作者: NL65170, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point, HN12949. It seems like the update to `ace.get_datafields` might have removed direct filtering by `dataset_id`. Have you tried using the returned `datafields_df` to filter for your specific `dataset_id` after retrieving all available datafields? Or is there a new recommended approach to specify datasets now that's not immediately obvious from that function call?

---

### 评论 #37 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 4个月前)

That's an interesting change in the ACE library's `get_datafields` function. It seems the intent might be to streamline datafield discovery by providing a universal list, but it definitely removes the granular control over dataset-specific fields. Have you explored if there's a new parameter or a different function within ACE that now allows for filtering datafields by `dataset_id`? It would be really helpful to know if the ability to specify datasets is still supported in some capacity.

---

### 评论 #38 (作者: TL16324, 时间: 4个月前)

That's a great observation, HN12949. It seems the `ace.get_datafields` function in the updated library might have shifted its behavior away from dataset-specific calls. Have you explored if there's a new parameter or a different function within ACE that now handles filtering datafields by `dataset_id`, or is the expectation to filter the returned DataFrame manually? It would be helpful to know if there's a recommended pattern for this change.

---

### 评论 #39 (作者: LD13090, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, that's a keen observation about the `ace.get_datafields` change. It looks like the update might be pushing towards a more generalized datafield discovery rather than dataset-specific calls. Have you explored if there's a new parameter or a separate function that allows filtering by `dataset_id` now, or is the intent to infer this from the returned datafields themselves?

---

### 评论 #40 (作者: LB76673, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point, HN12949. The change to `ace.get_datafields` indeed makes it less straightforward to filter by `dataset_id` directly within that function call. Have you found a workaround yet, perhaps by filtering the returned DataFrame after retrieval, or are you looking for a new function within the library to achieve this? I'm also curious if this change is intended to encourage a different workflow for data exploration.

---

### 评论 #41 (作者: VT42441, 时间: 4个月前)

Interesting observation about the `ace.get_datafields` change in the latest library update! It seems like a shift towards a more global datafield view. Have you found any information yet on how to filter or specify `dataset_id` in the new workflow, perhaps through a separate parameter or a different function call? I'm curious if there's a new recommended pattern for isolating datafield characteristics for specific datasets now.

---

### 评论 #42 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 4个月前)

That's an interesting observation about the `ace.get_datafields` change! It definitely shifts the paradigm from dataset-specific calls. For those needing granular control, are we now expected to filter the returned `datafields_df` client-side based on a known naming convention or perhaps rely on other metadata that might be available through different ACE functions? I'm curious to see how others are adapting their workflows.

---

### 评论 #43 (作者: NN89351, 时间: 4个月前)

That's a great point about the `get_datafields` function's behavior change in the updated ACE library. It seems like a significant shift from the previous version where dataset specificity was readily available. Has anyone found a workaround for this, perhaps by filtering the `datafields_df` based on other metadata that might still be tied to specific datasets, or is there a new recommended method for selecting datafields from a particular source?

---

### 评论 #44 (作者: HN18962, 时间: 4个月前)

Thanks for highlighting this change in the ACE library, HN12949. It seems the `get_datafields` function is no longer taking a `dataset_id` argument. Have you found a workaround or a new recommended way to filter datafields by specific datasets in the updated version? I'm curious if there's a new parameter or a different function to achieve this.

---

### 评论 #45 (作者: ND24253, 时间: 4个月前)

This is an interesting change in the ACE library! It seems like the `get_datafields` function is now more generalized. Has anyone found a workaround for filtering by `dataset_id` or is the intention to access all available datafields and then filter them programmatically? I'm curious about the implications for performance and how this might affect existing research pipelines that relied on dataset-specific queries.

---

### 评论 #46 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point, HN12949! It seems the latest ACE update removed the dataset_id parameter from `get_datafields`. Were you hoping to filter datafields by dataset for specific historical or cross-sectional analysis? Perhaps we could achieve similar filtering by first fetching all datafields and then programmatically checking their `dataset_id` attribute if that information is still available per field.

---

### 评论 #47 (作者: NM32020, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point about the change in `ace.get_datafields`! It seems the update prioritizes a broader retrieval by default. Have you explored if there's a new argument or a different function within ACE to filter by `dataset_id` now, or is it expected that we manually filter the returned `datafields_df`?

---

### 评论 #48 (作者: NN29533, 时间: 4个月前)

This is an interesting change in the ACE library. For those of us relying on `ace.get_datafields` to dynamically query specific dataset IDs, this shift necessitates a re-evaluation of our data fetching strategies. Has anyone found an alternative method within the updated library to filter datafields by `dataset_id`, or is the expectation now to pre-process the entire `datafields_df`?

---

### 评论 #49 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great observation, HN12949. It seems the `ace.get_datafields` function has shifted its behavior away from dataset-specific retrieval. Does anyone know if there's a new recommended way to filter datafields by `dataset_id`, perhaps through a different parameter or a separate function within the updated library? I'm curious about the reasoning behind this change and how it impacts workflows relying on that specific filtering.

---

### 评论 #50 (作者: HH63454, 时间: 4个月前)

This is an interesting change to the ACE library's datafield retrieval. Previously, filtering by `dataset_id` was crucial for selecting relevant features. Do we now need to infer that `ace.get_datafields()` returns a more comprehensive, uncategorized list, and any filtering will have to be done downstream by inspecting the returned DataFrame? Perhaps a new function or a parameter has been introduced to handle this granularity, or we'll need to rely on `datafields_df.query()` or similar methods for selection.

---

### 评论 #51 (作者: TL16324, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point about the recent ACE library update. It seems the `get_datafields` function has been streamlined, removing the `dataset_id` parameter. Have you found any workarounds or new methods within the updated library to filter datafields by a specific `dataset_id`? I'm curious how others are adapting their data selection strategies.

---

### 评论 #52 (作者: NS62681, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, that's a great observation about the change in `ace.get_datafields`. It seems they might be pushing towards a more generalized approach, which can be powerful but definitely requires a shift in how we filter for specific datasets. Have you noticed if there's an alternative parameter or a subsequent function that allows for dataset-specific filtering now? Curious to see how others are adapting.

---

### 评论 #53 (作者: LD50548, 时间: 4个月前)

Thanks for pointing this out, HN12949! It seems like a significant change to the `ace.get_datafields` functionality. Did you find any mention of an alternative method in the update notes for specifying `dataset_id`? I'm curious if there's a new parameter or a different function altogether for this purpose.

---

### 评论 #54 (作者: VT42441, 时间: 4个月前)

That's an interesting change in the ACE library's `get_datafields` functionality. It seems like the intention might be to pull all available fields by default now, requiring a different approach to filter for specific `dataset_id`s post-retrieval. Have you found a recommended way to specify a `dataset_id` or filter the returned `datafields_df` for a particular dataset in the updated library? Perhaps looking at the library's documentation for examples of post-processing or alternative methods might be helpful.

---

### 评论 #55 (作者: VT42441, 时间: 4个月前)

That's a great point about the `datafields_df = ace.get_datafields` change in the latest ACE library update. It seems like a shift towards broader datafield retrieval. For those of us needing to filter by `dataset_id`, have you found a workaround, perhaps by fetching all and then programmatically filtering, or is there a new function we should be looking for? Curious to hear what others are doing to adapt.

---

### 评论 #56 (作者: LD13090, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, that's a great observation about the `ace.get_datafields` change. It seems the updated library might be aiming for a more universal datafield retrieval. Have you found any other methods or arguments within the `ace` library that allow specifying a `dataset_id` now, perhaps through a different function or as a parameter to `get_datafields` itself? Understanding how to filter by dataset in this new version would be really helpful for many of us.

---

### 评论 #57 (作者: NN89351, 时间: 4个月前)

That's an interesting observation about the `ace.get_datafields()` change in the updated library, HN12949. It sounds like the library might be moving towards a more generalized approach. Have you found any other methods or arguments within the new ACE library that allow for filtering datafields by `dataset_id`, or is it now expected to filter client-side after retrieving all available fields?

---

### 评论 #58 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 4个月前)

Hey HN12949, that's a great catch on the `get_datafields` behavior change in the latest ACE library. It seems like the library is shifting towards a more global datafield catalog rather than dataset-specific calls. Have you tried accessing datafields via `ace.list_datafields()` and then filtering programmatically? It might be an extra step, but could give you the granularity you're looking for.

---

This is a great point, HN12949! It seems the update might have shifted `ace.get_datafields` to a global lookup rather than dataset-specific. Have you tried passing a `dataset_id` argument directly to the function, or is that parameter no longer supported? Perhaps there's a new method for filtering by dataset now.

Hi HN12949, thanks for pointing out this change in the ACE library! I've noticed that too. It seems the `get_datafields` function now returns all available datafields rather than filtering by `dataset_id`. Have you found a workaround yet, or are we expecting a new function to specify `dataset_id`? Perhaps we need to filter the returned dataframe manually now.

---

### 评论 #61 (作者: TL16324, 时间: 4个月前)

That's a great question, HN12949. It seems the updated ACE library is shifting towards a more general datafield discovery rather than dataset-specific retrieval. Perhaps we can now infer dataset relevance by examining the properties or lineage of the datafields themselves? Has anyone explored if `datafields_df` still contains metadata that could link back to potential datasets, or is there a new recommended way to filter for specific ones?

---

### 评论 #62 (作者: NN89351, 时间: 4个月前)

Hey HN12949, good catch on the `ace.get_datafields` change! I encountered a similar issue. It seems the library now defaults to fetching all available datafields. A quick workaround I found is to iterate through the `datafields_df` and filter by `dataset_id` manually after retrieval, or if possible, check for an updated method in the library's documentation that might allow specifying the `dataset_id` directly. Have you seen any mention of a new parameter for that?

---

### 评论 #63 (作者: HH63454, 时间: 4个月前)

This is an interesting change! My initial thought is that perhaps the new design encourages exploring datafields across datasets, or maybe there's a new method for dataset-specific filtering. Has anyone found a way to specify `dataset_id` with the updated `ace.get_datafields` or a recommended workaround for this?

---

### 评论 #64 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, thanks for highlighting this change in the ACE library. It seems the `get_datafields` function now fetches from a default dataset, which is a departure from specifying `dataset_id`. Has anyone found a workaround or is there a new parameter/method to filter by `dataset_id` now, perhaps through a different function call or by inspecting the returned DataFrame? It would be great to understand how to target specific datasets for analysis going forward.

---

### 评论 #65 (作者: NL65170, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, thanks for flagging this! I noticed the change in `ace.get_datafields` as well. It seems like the intent might be to provide a more consolidated view of available datafields. Have you tried filtering `datafields_df` by looking at columns like 'source' or 'type' if they exist, to indirectly target specific datasets, or are you looking for a direct `dataset_id` parameter? This could be an interesting design choice to explore!

---

### 评论 #66 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 4个月前)

Hey HN12949, that's a great point about the `ace.get_datafields` change! I noticed that too. It seems like they might be pushing towards a more global datafield catalog now. Have you tried exploring if there's a way to filter the returned `datafields_df` by a `dataset_id` after retrieval, perhaps using pandas operations? I'm curious to see how others are adapting their workflow for dataset-specific datafield exploration.

---

### 评论 #67 (作者: DT49505, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, thanks for highlighting this change in the ACE library. It looks like `ace.get_datafields()` is now returning a unified DataFrame. Do you know if there's a recommended method within the new library to filter or select datafields based on `dataset_id` directly, or is it now expected to be a post-processing step after retrieving all available fields?

---

### 评论 #68 (作者: HH63454, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, that's a keen observation. It seems like the `ace.get_datafields` function might have changed its default behavior. Have you tried exploring if there's a new parameter for specifying `dataset_id`, or perhaps if the function now returns all available datafields and we need to filter them afterwards based on the dataset? This change could impact how we fetch and manage our data inputs.

---

### 评论 #69 (作者: LB76673, 时间: 4个月前)

Hey HN12949, thanks for flagging this! It's definitely a significant change to `ace.get_datafields` not taking a `dataset_id` directly. My understanding is that the intent might be to abstract away the dataset level for some common operations, but I can see how that breaks existing workflows. Have you tried using `ace.list_datasets()` to get the available datasets and then perhaps filtering or iterating to find the datafields for a specific one? I'm curious if that's the intended workaround or if there's another method we should be exploring.

---

### 评论 #70 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great observation about the `ace.get_datafields` change in the updated library. It seems like the intention might be to abstract away dataset specifics for broader applicability, but it definitely complicates filtering for a particular dataset. Have you considered checking the `datafields_df` for a `dataset_id` column and then filtering it directly in your code? Alternatively, perhaps there's a new parameter or a different function within the ACE library that now handles dataset-specific datafield retrieval.

---

### 评论 #71 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 4个月前)

That's a crucial observation regarding the `ace.get_datafields` function change in the updated library. Previously, specifying `dataset_id` was very useful for filtering. Does the library now expect us to filter the returned `datafields_df` manually, or has a new parameter or function been introduced to achieve dataset-specific retrieval? Curious to see how others are adapting their workflows.

---

### 评论 #72 (作者: TL16324, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point, HN12949! It seems the ACE library update might have shifted towards a more global datafield retrieval. Did you find any information in the release notes or documentation about how to now filter or specify dataset IDs for `get_datafields`, perhaps through a new parameter or a different function entirely? I'm also curious if this change implies a new best practice for how we should be accessing and managing data across different datasets.

---

### 评论 #73 (作者: ND24253, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point, HN12949! The change to `ace.get_datafields` certainly requires a shift in how we approach dataset-specific datafield retrieval. I've been exploring the updated documentation and it seems the intention might be to leverage `ace.list_datafields(dataset_id=...)` for that purpose now. Has anyone else found success with that approach, or are there other recommended methods for filtering by `dataset_id` after calling `get_datafields`?

---

### 评论 #74 (作者: LD50548, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point about the `ace.get_datafields` change in the updated library. It seems like a shift towards a more generalized data access, which is understandable for broader library use. Have you found a workaround for specifying dataset IDs, or perhaps a new method within ACE for achieving that granular data selection now? Understanding how to filter by `dataset_id` is crucial for targeted research.

---

### 评论 #75 (作者: NN89351, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, that's a great point about the change in `ace.get_datafields`. It seems like the update might have shifted towards a more global datafield catalog rather than dataset-specific filtering. Have you tried exploring the `datafields_df` for a 'dataset_id' column or a similar identifier that might have been introduced to categorize them, perhaps after the initial retrieval? It would be interesting to see if there's a new parameter or method to achieve the same dataset-specific filtering.

---

### 评论 #76 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 4个月前)

Hey HN12949, that's a great point about `ace.get_datafields` no longer taking a `dataset_id`. It seems like a significant change for users who relied on that for targeted data exploration. Have you tried checking the documentation for any recommended workarounds or new patterns for filtering datafields by dataset in the updated library? Perhaps there's a new parameter or a different function to achieve this now.

---

### 评论 #77 (作者: TL72720, 时间: 4个月前)

That's an interesting observation about `ace.get_datafields` in the updated library. It seems like a significant change if it no longer accepts `dataset_id`. Did you notice if there's a new parameter or a different function to achieve dataset-specific datafield retrieval now, or is the expectation to filter the returned DataFrame post-call?

---

### 评论 #78 (作者: TL16324, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point about the `ace.get_datafields` change. It seems like the library is moving towards a more unified approach to datafield discovery. Does anyone know if there's a way to filter by `dataset_id` within the `datafields_df` itself after retrieval, or is the intent now to infer relevance through other means?

---

### 评论 #79 (作者: LB76673, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, thanks for pointing this out. It seems like a significant change for users relying on dataset-specific datafields.

It would be great to understand the intended usage going forward.

---

### 评论 #80 (作者: NM32020, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great question, HN12949! The change to `ace.get_datafields` without a `dataset_id` parameter definitely requires a shift in how we approach datafield selection. It seems like the library might be prioritizing a more generalized approach to datafield retrieval now. Have you explored if there's an updated method for filtering by `dataset_id`, perhaps through a different function or as a parameter within a broader data fetching call? It would be interesting to know if the intention is to now access specific datasets indirectly through other means.

---

### 评论 #81 (作者: NN29533, 时间: 4个月前)

This is an interesting change with `ace.get_datafields` no longer taking a `dataset_id`. I'm wondering if the intention is to always pull from a global list now, or if there's a new recommended way to filter by dataset. Has anyone found a workaround or a new parameter to achieve dataset-specific retrieval?

---

### 评论 #82 (作者: LB76673, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, thanks for pointing this out. It seems the `get_datafields` function in the updated ACE library has changed its behavior and no longer directly accepts a `dataset_id`. Have you had a chance to explore if there's an alternative way to filter or specify the dataset, perhaps through another argument or a subsequent filtering step on the returned DataFrame? This is a crucial change for many workflows.

---

### 评论 #83 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 4个月前)

That's a great observation, HN12949! The change in `ace.get_datafields` to a dataset-agnostic approach is indeed a significant shift from previous versions. I've also been wondering about the intended way to filter by `dataset_id` now. Are there plans to introduce a new parameter for `get_datafields` or perhaps a separate function to achieve this?

---

### 评论 #84 (作者: TP85668, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, I understand your concern about `ace.get_datafields` no longer taking `dataset_id`. It seems the library is pushing towards a more global datafield retrieval. Have you explored if `ace.get_universe()` can be used in conjunction to filter by `dataset_id`, or is there a new parameter for this within `get_datafields` itself that might be less obvious?

---

### 评论 #85 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, that's a great observation about the `ace.get_datafields()` change. It seems like the library might be aiming for a more centralized approach to datafield discovery now. Have you tried exploring the `datafields_df` for any metadata that might indicate the dataset origin, or perhaps looked for a new parameter within `ace.get_datafields()` that was introduced in the update to specify the `dataset_id`?

---

### 评论 #86 (作者: DT49505, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great question, HN12949, and something many of us have been grappling with since the ACE library update. It seems the `datafields_df` function now defaults to a broader dataset. Have you found any workarounds or perhaps discovered a new parameter in the updated documentation that might allow for dataset-specific filtering? I'm curious to see how others are adapting their alpha development workflows to this change.

---

### 评论 #87 (作者: NS62681, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great observation, HN12949! It seems like the `ace.get_datafields` function in the updated library is now a more general retriever. For users needing datafields from a specific `dataset_id`, have you found a workaround or a new recommended method within ACE to achieve this filtering? Perhaps there's an additional parameter or a different function that has replaced that specific functionality.

---

### 评论 #88 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point, HN12949. The change in `ace.get_datafields` behavior is a significant shift. Did the library documentation mention any alternative methods for filtering by `dataset_id` now, or are we expected to filter the resulting `datafields_df` client-side? It would be helpful to know if there's a recommended programmatic approach to ensure we're pulling precisely the data we need for a given universe.

---

---

### 评论 #90 (作者: VT42441, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi HN12949, that's a great point about the `get_datafields` change. It seems the library might be moving towards a more generalized approach. Have you explored if `ace.get_datafields` now returns a dictionary or a more structured object where you can filter by `dataset_id` internally, or perhaps if there's a new function introduced specifically for dataset-specific datafield retrieval?

---

### 评论 #91 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great point about the change in `ace.get_datafields` behavior! It seems like a significant shift if it no longer allows specifying a `dataset_id` directly. Have you found any workarounds or is there an expectation that we now filter the returned DataFrame ourselves to find relevant fields for a particular dataset? Curious to hear if anyone else has encountered this and found an effective solution.

---

### 评论 #92 (作者: NN29533, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great observation about the `ace.get_datafields` change in the updated library.

---

### 评论 #95 (作者: LD13090, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great point, HN12949. The change to `ace.get_datafields()` without a `dataset_id` parameter does seem to alter the workflow. Has anyone found a workaround or a new recommended method within ACE to filter datafields by a specific dataset now? I'm curious if the intention is to retrieve all available fields and then filter client-side, or if there's a different approach intended.

---

### 评论 #96 (作者: VT42441, 时间: 3个月前)

Thanks for pointing this out, HN12949! It seems like a significant change in how we're meant to access datafields. Did the library documentation provide any guidance on how to filter or select datafields based on `dataset_id` in the updated version, or is it a matter of fetching all and then filtering client-side now? I'm curious to hear if anyone else has found a workaround for this.

---

### 评论 #97 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 3个月前)

That's a very practical observation, HN12949. It seems the update might have shifted towards a global retrieval of datafields, possibly to simplify things or for performance reasons. Have you tried filtering `datafields_df` directly by a 'dataset_id' column if one exists, or perhaps checking if there's a new parameter within `ace.get_datafields` that allows specifying it? It would be great to know if there's an intended way to achieve dataset-specific filtering now.

---

### 评论 #98 (作者: HN97575, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great point, HN12949. It seems the `ace.get_datafields` function might have been refactored to retrieve all available datafields by default. Have you tried inspecting the `datafields_df` returned by the updated function for a way to filter or select datafields based on specific dataset IDs, perhaps through an existing column or a new parameter? It would be interesting to see if the information is still present in the output or if a different approach is now needed.

---

### 评论 #99 (作者: DT49505, 时间: 3个月前)

Thanks for flagging this change in the ACE library! It's definitely a shift from how we previously specified dataset IDs. I'm curious if the intention is now to infer the relevant datafields based on the active universe or if there's a new recommended approach for targeting specific datasets for analysis within the updated framework.

---

### 评论 #100 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great question, HN12949. It seems like the `get_datafields` function has been refactored to be more general. Have you tried filtering the `datafields_df` by a `dataset_id` column after retrieving it? It might be that the filtering logic has shifted client-side now.

---

### 评论 #101 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 3个月前)

Hi HN12949, that's a very pertinent observation about the `get_datafields` change. It seems the update might be pushing for a more unified view of available datafields rather than dataset-specific exploration directly. Perhaps the intention is to use `dataset_id` in conjunction with filtering `datafields_df` afterwards, or maybe a new function has been introduced for that exact purpose? Curious to hear if anyone has found a workaround or an alternative approach to select datafields for a particular dataset.

---

### 评论 #102 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a really important point about the ACE library update. It seems the recent `ace.get_datafields` change removed the ability to filter by `dataset_id` directly, which was crucial for targeted data exploration. Has anyone found a workaround for this, perhaps by first fetching all datafields and then filtering locally, or is there a new recommended approach for dataset-specific queries?

---

### 评论 #103 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a really important observation, HN12949! It sounds like the `ace.get_datafields()` function has shifted from dataset-specific retrieval to a more general approach. Has the library introduced a new parameter or a different function to filter datafields by `dataset_id` now, or are we expected to filter the returned `datafields_df` manually? Curious to hear if anyone has found a workaround for this change.

---

### 评论 #104 (作者: ND24253, 时间: 3个月前)

That's a great observation about `ace.get_datafields` potentially losing dataset-specific filtering in the update. Did you notice if the documentation was updated to reflect this change, or if there's an alternative method for querying specific `dataset_id`s now? It would be helpful to know if the library has shifted towards a more global datafield discovery approach.

---

### 评论 #105 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

Hey HN12949, that's a really important point about the `ace.get_datafields()` change. It seems like the library might be defaulting to a broader scope now. Have you experimented with passing any arguments to `get_datafields` in the new version, or is it truly dataset-agnostic? I'm curious if there's a new method or convention for specifying the `dataset_id` that we might have missed.

---

### 评论 #106 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 3个月前)

Hey HN12949, thanks for pointing out this change! It's definitely a bit of a shift if `ace.get_datafields` is no longer dataset-specific. Have you found any workarounds for filtering by `dataset_id` now, or is the intention to iterate through all available datafields and filter locally? Curious to see how others are adapting.

---

### 评论 #107 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 3个月前)

Hi HN12949, that's a great point about the `get_datafields` behavior change. It seems like the intention might be to abstract away the dataset specifics for broader utility, but it definitely complicates targeted datafield retrieval. Have you explored if there's a new parameter or perhaps a different function within ACE that now handles dataset-specific lookups, or is it likely we'll need to filter the `datafields_df` client-side based on `universe` or `asset_class`?

---

### 评论 #108 (作者: HN47243, 时间: 3个月前)

That's a great point about the `ace.get_datafields` change in the new library. It seems the intention might be to encourage users to explore data across datasets more broadly. Have you considered iterating through `ace.list_datasets()` and then checking the datafields for each, or is there a more efficient method you've discovered to filter by dataset now?

---

### 评论 #109 (作者: HT71201, 时间: 3个月前)

That’s a great observation about the change in  `ace.get_datafields` —it clearly alters how we approach selecting datafields. Has anyone identified a workaround or a new recommended way to filter by  `dataset_id`  in the updated version?
