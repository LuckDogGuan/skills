## 帖子正文

I’ve been going through the  **ASI Scalability Theme**  requirements, and I’m a bit confused. Even after passing the  **Robust Universe Test**  in my submissions, I’m not getting the theme multiplier.

Is there some additional criteria beyond just passing the robust returns and Sharpe thresholds? For example, do certain alpha types (like Power Pool) get excluded automatically, or is there some extra check for broad applicability?

Would really appreciate if someone who has already managed to get their alphas counted under this theme can clarify the exact conditions. 🙏

Great and practical question. Not getting the multiplier even after passing the Robust Universe Test may be due to extra criteria (e.g., alpha type, broad applicability checks, or ASI-specific exclusions). I’d recommend reviewing the official theme guidelines and comparing notes with others who have had their alphas accepted.

Yeah, just passing the robust test isn’t always enough for Scalability. The system also checks if your alpha works broadly across bigger universes and doesn’t rely on narrow signal types. That’s why some structures like Power Pool can fail even if they’re robust, since they don’t scale well in wider markets.

From my experience, just passing the Robust Universe Test alone isn’t enough to qualify for the ASI Scalability Theme multiplier. The theme is specifically looking for alphas that are broadly applicable and scalable across assets, so there are a few extra layers of filtering:

- **Alpha Type**  – Certain formulations (like Power Pool, very narrow cross-sectional filters, or extremely asset-specific constructions) may not qualify because they don’t demonstrate generalizable scalability.
- **Breadth of Applicability**  – The alpha should work across a wide set of assets and not only a very small niche. If it’s too specialized, it usually won’t be counted under this theme.
- **Robustness Beyond RUT**  – Even if you clear the Robust Universe Test, internal checks may still look at stability across different sub-universes, turnover, and transaction cost resilience.

So in short, yes — there are additional criteria beyond just passing RUT + Sharpe. The intent is to ensure that only alphas with truly scalable and broad market potential qualify for the multiplier.

thanks guys ,after robust test pass is not always enough for Scalability theme , the alpha you had submitted should perform better for other universe

This is a really important discussion because the ASI Scalability Theme touches on one of the biggest challenges in alpha design: ensuring that a signal not only performs well in a controlled test but also scales in wider, more realistic trading environments. Passing the Robust Universe Test is certainly a necessary step, but as others have pointed out, it is not sufficient. Scalability requires additional robustness, such as breadth of applicability across liquid assets, resilience under turnover/cost constraints, and avoidance of overly narrow constructions like Power Pool-style formulations or highly asset-specific filters. For example, an alpha that works only within a small corner of the universe may look statistically strong but won’t qualify for Scalability because it cannot expand to larger capital bases. To increase the chances of meeting this theme, I’d suggest focusing on broad, economically intuitive signals, verifying stability across sub-universes, and stress-testing turnover and cost sensitivity. Using neutralization, decay adjustments, and ensuring high long/short balance can also improve generalizability. This way, your alpha has a better chance of being accepted as truly scalable and earning the multiplier.

Your question touches on one of the trickier aspects of theme multipliers, especially the ASI Scalability Theme. Passing the Robust Universe Test is necessary, but not always sufficient for the multiplier to apply. From what I’ve observed, the scalability check goes beyond just Sharpe and robustness—it evaluates whether the alpha is genuinely broad-based and implementable across the ASI universe. This means that signals that are overly dependent on niche operators, exotic transformations, or high-turnover structures may not qualify, even if they “pass” the robustness filters. In some cases, Power Pool alphas are flagged because of turnover intensity or hidden biases toward certain liquidity tiers, which conflicts with the idea of scalable deployment. Another point to consider is cross-sectional applicability: the system likely checks whether your alpha contributes consistently across many instruments, not just a concentrated subset. A practical way to diagnose this is to examine the distribution of alpha contributions across ASI constituents—if it’s dominated by just a handful of names, the multiplier may not apply. It would be useful to hear if others have confirmed similar experiences, but in my view, the theme is as much about breadth and implementability as it is about raw robustness.

This is a great question, Passing the Robust Universe Test is an important step, but from what I understand, the ASI Scalability Theme may have more conditions. Sometimes, it’s not only about strong returns and Sharpe, but also about how broadly the alpha can scale across regions and universes. Certain types of alphas, like very specialized ones, may not qualify if they’re seen as less scalable. It might also depend on stability across different time periods or factor styles. If anyone who has cleared this theme can share their experience, it would really help others facing the same doubt.

Thank you for bringing up this question about the ASI Scalability Theme

That’s a really relevant question. Even if an alpha passes the Robust Universe Test, it may not receive the multiplier due to factors like the alpha’s category, broader applicability standards, or exclusions specific to ASI.

As far as I understand, if your alpha does not match the ASI Scalability theme, there is a very high likelihood that your alpha has not successfully passed the robust universe test.

The ASI Scalability Theme is one of the more nuanced evaluation layers in WorldQuant, and your experience highlights exactly why many consultants get confused. Passing the Robust Universe Test is necessary but not sufficient—Scalability requires that an alpha demonstrates  **breadth, generalizability, and implementability**  across large universes. This means that narrow structures, such as Power Pool formulations or highly specialized filters, often fail to qualify even when their statistics look strong. In addition, the theme implicitly evaluates  **turnover, cost sensitivity, and cross-sectional distribution** —an alpha that concentrates signal strength in a few assets or churns excessively won’t be deemed scalable. From a design perspective, it’s helpful to build alphas with economically intuitive logic, test them across multiple sub-universes, and ensure they are neutralized against common factors so they can extend naturally to broader markets. This way, your work not only passes robustness checks but also has a better chance of satisfying the theme’s scalability requirements and earning the multiplier.

Thank you for raising this question about the ASI Scalability Theme. I’ve been puzzled by the same issue—passing the Robust Universe Test yet not receiving the multiplier—and your post helped me realize that there are additional hidden layers at play. I really appreciate the way you framed the problem by asking whether exclusions (like Power Pool) or extra applicability checks might be involved. That perspective alone makes the whole process clearer, because it reminds me that themes are not just about statistical robustness, but about whether an alpha can realistically scale in deployment. Your post also sparked a valuable community discussion, which helps consultants like me avoid chasing performance in too narrow a way. I’m grateful that you brought this up, because it pushes me to design alphas with broader applicability in mind and to think beyond just “passing RUT.”

###### Thanks for raising this thoughtful question about the ASI Scalability Theme. You did a great job distinguishing between passing the Robust Universe Test and actually receiving the multiplier—something many of us notice but don’t always say out loud. Highlighting possible exclusions like Power Pool structures or other applicability checks is really useful, since it reminds us that themes are about both performance and practical deployment. Even without a single “official” answer, posts like yours spark valuable discussion and surface insights from others with similar experiences. Appreciate you starting such a clear and well-structured conversation!

This is a great question. Passing the Robust Universe Test is definitely a key milestone, but from what I’ve gathered, the ASI Scalability Theme may involve additional criteria. It’s not just about strong returns or Sharpe ratios—it also considers how well an alpha can scale across regions and universes. Highly specialized alphas might fall short if they’re viewed as less scalable. Stability across time periods and alignment with broader factor styles might also play a role. It would be really helpful if anyone who has successfully passed this theme could share their insights.
