Hi, I currently have a high value factor, but the Combined Alpha Performance and Combined Selected Alpha Performance metrics are quite modest. Initially, I thought these metrics would be directly proportional to each other. However, after the quarterly update, it seems that these metrics are measuring different things. I would like to ask about the relationship between these metrics. Is there a strategy for submitting alpha to make these metrics proportional to each other? Thanks all.

Exploring the nuances between my high value factor and the modest Combined Alpha Performance metrics has been enlightening. It appears these metrics assess distinct dimensions of alpha generation. I'm curious about strategies to align them more closely, ensuring a balanced approach to submitting alpha. Any insights on optimizing this relationship would be greatly appreciated!

High value factor doesn’t always ensure high combined alpha performance. Understanding metric differences and refining selection can help align them better.

Your observation is spot on — a high-value factor doesn't always translate to strong combined performance. That's because  **Combined Alpha Performance**  measures how your alpha contributes to an existing pool, not just how strong it is on its own. If your alpha is highly correlated with existing ones, its added value may be limited, even if the standalone V-score is high. To improve both metrics together, try focusing on building  **diversified, low-correlation alphas**  that offer unique insights, rather than just optimizing for individual performance.

Diving into the differences between my high value factor and the relatively modest Combined Alpha Performance metrics has been quite insightful. It seems these metrics capture different aspects of alpha generation. I'm interested in learning how to better align the two to create a more balanced and effective submission strategy. Any advice on optimizing this relationship would be greatly appreciated!

Absolutely, that makes sense. It's becoming clear that a strong value factor alone isn’t enough—fine-tuning selection strategies and understanding how each metric reflects different strengths is key. Thanks for the insight!

A high value factor alone won’t guarantee strong Combined Alpha Performance. Since the metrics capture different aspects of alpha quality, it’s important to understand their differences and refine your selection strategy to better align them.

Simulating and submitting alphas requires a clear strategy because Value Factor, Combined Alpha Performance (CAP), and Combined Selected Alpha Performance (CSAP) measure different aspects. To improve results, focus on high-Sharpe alphas, diversify your ideas, avoid submitting duplicates or weak alphas, and closely monitor CSAP performance to optimize submission timing.

Hi! While the  **value factor**  reflects signal strength and predictive quality,  **Combined Alpha Performance (CAP)**  and  **Combined Selected Alpha Performance (CSAP)**  measure different things:

- **CAP** : Performance of all submitted alphas.
- **CSAP** : Performance of only selected (deployed) alphas in the Power Pool.

They are  **not directly proportional** . You can have high value factor but modest CAP/CSAP if your alphas aren’t selected or combined poorly.

**Strategy to align them:**

1. **Submit fewer, high-quality alphas**  with strong, stable performance.
2. **Ensure diversity**  across signals (uncorrelated and low turnover).
3. Use  **combining strategies**  like truncation, decay, or neutralization to reduce overlap and improve CAP.
4. Target  **selection criteria**  (e.g., low correlation, high Sharpe, decent turnover).

Over time, refining your alpha portfolio will help CAP and CSAP rise more proportionally to your value factor.

It’s common to think that a high value factor will automatically lead to strong combined performance, but that’s not always the case. Combined Alpha Performance looks at how your alphas work together, while Combined Selected Alpha Performance focuses on how selected alphas perform in combination. To improve both, try submitting diverse alphas with different logic and styles. Avoid similar patterns across your submissions. Also, simulate regularly to see how new alphas affect the overall pool. A good strategy is to balance strong individual alpha performance with variety to improve both combined metrics over time.

A strong value factor doesn’t ensure high Combined Alpha Performance. Since each metric reflects different alpha qualities, refining your selection strategy to align them is key.

High value factor on its own doesn’t guarantee strong Combined Alpha Performance. Since each metric reflects different dimensions of alpha quality, it’s important to understand their distinctions and refine your selection strategy to better align them for more effective results.

Exploring the gap between my high Value Factor and relatively modest Combined Alpha Performance (CAP) metrics has been a revealing experience. It’s clear that these metrics reflect different dimensions of alpha generation—Value Factor captures uniqueness and contribution to the overall signal pool, while CAP emphasizes risk-adjusted return consistency, low correlation, and strong performance across selected alpha combinations. To better align the two, I’m looking to improve the selection and combination of my submitted alphas. That means submitting less correlated signals, refining signal quality with stronger PnL curves, and focusing on robustness across various regimes. I also suspect that monitoring CAP drivers like volatility, drawdown, and fitness consistency may help ensure my alphas not only contribute value but also integrate effectively into the platform’s combined strategies. I’m eager to hear more from others who have worked on bridging this gap. What methods have helped you align strong Value Factor scores with consistently high CAP performance?

### 评论 #14 (作者: NQ13558, 时间: 1年前)

I’ve noticed the same thing, that a strong value factor doesn’t always lead to high combined metrics. It definitely feels like there’s more going on behind the scenes. Have you tried comparing how your alphas perform in isolation vs. in the power pool to spot any patterns?

This is a classic portfolio construction problem. You've discovered that having a collection of individually good alphas doesn't automatically create a good  *portfolio* .

Think of it like building a basketball team. Your "Value Factor" might be high because you've successfully recruited five players who are all elite three-point shooters. They're all individually great. But your "Combined Performance" will be poor because you have no one to defend, rebound, or handle the ball. Your team is one-dimensional.

The combined performance metrics (CAP and CSAP) measure how well your players (alphas) perform  *together*  as a team. The key to improving them is  **diversification** . You need alphas that do different things. If all your alphas are trend-following, they will all fail at the same time when the market is range-bound. You need to mix in some mean-reversion alphas, some value-based alphas, etc., so that some part of your portfolio is always suited to the current market environment.

Exploring the gap between my high value factor and relatively modest Combined Alpha Performance (CAP) metrics has been a valuable learning experience. It’s clear now that these two scores reflect different aspects of alpha design: the value factor emphasizes uniqueness and diversity across your alpha portfolio, while CAP captures how well your alphas perform when combined and selected in production settings. Bridging this gap requires a more intentional approach—focusing not only on creating diverse, orthogonal alphas, but also on ensuring they complement each other effectively in a portfolio context. Submitting Power Pool–eligible alphas, optimizing turnover, and maintaining strong out-of-sample stability can all help improve both scores simultaneously. I'm now aiming to refine my submissions by prioritizing robust cross-universe consistency and thoughtful operator use, rather than maximizing novelty alone. Striking this balance seems crucial for long-term impact.

For those who’ve faced a similar challenge—what specific changes helped you bring value factor and CAP into better alignment?

Reflecting on the gap between my strong value factor and more modest Combined Alpha Performance (CAP) metrics has been an eye-opening process. I've come to understand that these two metrics highlight different strengths: the value factor rewards diversity and originality across alphas, while CAP measures how effectively those alphas work together when selected for production. Closing this gap means taking a more deliberate approach—crafting alphas that are not only distinct but also synergistic in portfolio settings. I’ve started focusing more on submitting Power Pool–eligible alphas, managing turnover carefully, and ensuring out-of-sample stability to support both scores. Moving forward, I’m refining my approach by emphasizing cross-universe consistency and more strategic operator usage, instead of just chasing novelty. Achieving balance between creativity and portfolio compatibility feels key to long-term results.

If you’ve faced a similar situation, what adjustments helped you better align your value factor with CAP?

Exploring the disconnect between a high value factor and relatively modest Combined Alpha Performance (CAP) has been an insightful journey. These metrics, while related, reflect different strengths in alpha design. The value factor rewards diversity and uniqueness across your alpha set—signals that are orthogonal and non-redundant. In contrast, CAP measures how well your alphas perform collectively when selected and deployed in production environments.

To close this gap, I’ve shifted from optimizing for novelty alone toward a more deliberate portfolio-oriented approach. This includes submitting Power Pool–eligible alphas that emphasize low turnover, high out-of-sample stability, and minimal internal correlation. I also focus on cross-universe consistency and intentional operator combinations that support structural robustness across market regimes.

By aligning design choices with both metrics, it becomes possible to build a stronger, more production-ready portfolio.
Have you found any operator pairs or signal archetypes that help unify value and CAP performance in your workflow?

A high value factor doesn’t guarantee strong combined performance. Focus on submitting diverse alphas with varied logic to boost Combined and Selected Combined Alpha Performance. Regularly simulate and balance individual strength with diversity for better results.

A high-value factor alone doesn't ensure strong combined performance.
To improve combined and selected combined alpha performance:

- **Submit diverse alphas**  with distinct logic and uncorrelated signals.

### 评论 #21 (作者: SG91420, 时间: 1年前)

You made a really helpful observation, and I've seen similar trends. It's critical to realize that a high value factor does not always correspond to a high Combined Selected Alpha Performance (SCAP) or Combined Alpha Performance (CAP).
Thus, the relationship isn't always direct. I would suggest experimenting with various datasets, geographical areas, and alpha styles in order to enhance CAP and SCAP; you could even mix in low-turnover or quality-based alphas. Diversifying beyond a single region or factor can occasionally enhance after-cost performance.

Having a high value factor doesn't necessarily translate to strong Combined Alpha Performance. Each metric reflects a different dimension of alpha quality, so it's crucial to understand how they differ. To improve results, refine your selection strategy in a way that aligns these metrics more effectively.

Thanks for raising this insightful question! While Value Factor, Combined Alpha Performance, and Combined Selected Alpha Performance are related, they measure different aspects of alpha quality and contribution. Understanding their distinctions and tailoring submissions to balance robustness and uniqueness can help align these metrics more closely over time.

### 评论 #24 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 10个月前)

You’ve captured the key insight: high value factor and CAP can diverge because they measure different aspects of alpha design. Value emphasizes  **diversity and orthogonality**  within your alpha set, while CAP reflects  **collective effectiveness**  when deployed in production.

Bridging the gap requires a portfolio-focused approach. Submitting  **Power Pool–eligible alphas**  that balance  **low turnover, strong out-of-sample stability, and low internal correlation**  helps align the two metrics. Cross-universe consistency and intentional operator pairings further reinforce structural robustness across regimes.

It’s less about maximizing novelty and more about ensuring that each alpha contributes  **complementarily**  to the ensemble. Thoughtful layering of operators—like combining rank-based and volatility-adjusted signals—often helps unify high value with strong CAP.

Which operator combinations or signal archetypes have you found effective in bringing value factor and CAP into closer alignment?

To effectively strategize alpha simulation and submission):

Simulate selectively: Test ideas only after strong economic intuition; avoid brute-force mining.

Control correlation: Measure self-correlation and existing pool overlap; prefer orthogonal alphas.

Stress-test early: Check performance across regions, universes, and sub-periods.

Optimize robustness: Favor stable IC, low turnover, and simple operators over fragile complexity.

Stagger submissions: Submit best-in-class alphas first; avoid flooding one dataset at once.

Iterate with feedback: Use decay, neutralization, and scaling tweaks to improve weak but promising signals.
