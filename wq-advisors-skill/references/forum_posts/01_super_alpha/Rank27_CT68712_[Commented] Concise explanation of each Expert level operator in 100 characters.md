[NM12321](/hc/en-us/profiles/9541480653463-NM12321)  You need to use it in combination with the  `self_corr`  function, for example, with the following combo:

```
stats = generate_stats(alpha);  innerCorr = self_corr(stats.returns, 500);  ic = if_else(innerCorr == 1.0, nan, innerCorr);  maxCorr = reduce_max(ic);  1 - maxCorr
```

By adjusting the Sharpe ratio threshold in the BRAIN platform, you're filtering out models that might have high returns but also take on too much risk. A Sharpe ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that the model has achieved a reasonable risk-adjusted return, and you should prioritize models that meet this benchmark.

Ensuring your Alpha model generalizes well to unseen data is crucial for its long-term success. Overfitting is a common pitfall, and it's great that you're focusing on strategies to avoid it. Testing your model on Out-of-Sample (OS) data, as you mentioned, is one of the most effective ways to check for overfitting. If your model performs well on both In-Sample (IS) and OS data, it’s more likely to be robust and reliable when faced with new market conditions.

Increasing the total number of operators while keeping the operator count per alpha low can be a challenge. To achieve this balance, take a strategic approach: develop multiple simple alphas with fewer operators. This keeps each alpha lightweight and efficient while collectively expanding your operator usage.

By focusing on simplicity, you can enhance alpha diversity, reduce correlation, and improve overall robustness. Remember, operators are just as crucial as other parameters in the Genius program. Scale thoughtfully and aim for a well-balanced approach building a broader, more resilient framework without compromising individual alpha quality.

To use  `reduce`  functions like  `reduce_avg`  or  `reduce_stddev`  without errors, you need to carefully manage the input and ensure it's being processed correctly. One common approach is to pair it with functions like  `self_corr`  to create meaningful inputs. Here’s an example:

`stats = generate_stats(alpha);
ic = reduce_stddev(self_corr(stats.pnl, 120), threshold=0);
1/(1+ic)`

For instance, when you're trying to average something out with  `reduce_avg` , you wanna make sure your 'input' is clean and consistent. If not, you might end up with NaNs or outliers messing up your results.Keep in mind, reducing functions are powerful for cleaning up noise in your signals. They can help you pinpoint the sweet spot in your data, which is gold when you're trying to forecast market moves.

Just a tip: always test these functions with a small subset of your data first to see how they handle your specific 'input'. It's like taking a test drive before hitting the highway, you know? Helps you avoid costly mistakes down the line.

Hi  [DP14281](/hc/en-us/profiles/25913729314967-DP14281) !

You can imagine data to be distributed in a way that's similar to the first curve below, where the x-axis is the value of the data points, while the y-axis is the count of data points at each value.

**right_tail:** Use only data points on the right side of the data curve, and discard data (assign as NaN) below the minimum threshold. This corresponds to the second curve.

**left_tail:** Use only data points on the left side of the data curve, and discard data (assign as NaN) above the maximum threshold. This corresponds to the third curve.

Thanks for sharing! These operators are indeed powerful for alpha generation. I’ve found  **ts_corr**  and  **ts_zscore**  particularly useful in refining signals.  **ts_corr(x, y, d)**  helps measure relationships between factors over time, ensuring signals maintain predictive relevance. Meanwhile,  **ts_zscore(x, d)**  effectively normalizes indicators, making cross-sectional comparisons more robust.

For example, applying  **ts_corr(price_change, volume, 20)**  helped detect liquidity-driven price movements, improving signal reliability. Similarly, using  **ts_zscore(momentum, 60)**  enhanced factor neutrality across different stocks.

Additionally,  **winsorize(x, std=4)**  has been great for handling extreme values, reducing the impact of outliers on strategy performance.

These tools have significantly improved my signal robustness, and I’m keen to explore more applications. Let’s continue refining our approaches together! 🚀
