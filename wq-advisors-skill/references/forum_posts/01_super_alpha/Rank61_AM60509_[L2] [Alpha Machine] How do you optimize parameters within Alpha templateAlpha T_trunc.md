Hello everyone, 👋
In the earlier discussions, we shared the idea of the  [Alpha template]([Commented] 【Alpha Template Collections】- Continuously UpdatePinnedAlpha Template_24472586368279.md) . The Alpha template aims to encapsulate a specific economic intuition. For example, consider the template from an  [earlier post]([L2] [Alpha Template] How can you use estimate and actual earnings data to create AlphasAlpha Template_25775603889431.md) :

> group_zscore(subtract(group_zscore(<act_data>, industry), group_zscore(<est_data>, industry)), industry)

This template calculates the difference in group-normalized actual data versus estimated data. You can explore pairs of actual and estimated data in datasets such as analyst7. This template can be further extended to:

> <group_compare_op_1>(<diff_op>(<group_compare_op_2>(<act_data>, <group_2>), <group_compare_op_3>(<est_data>, <group_3>)), <group_1>)

In this extended template, all the operators and group data turns into abstract choices. Each of these choices embodies the economic intuition behind the original selection. For instance, <group_compare_op_1> initially uses group_zscore, but other valid choices could include group_rank, which also compares the instrument to its relative peers in <group_1>.

Now, the question arises: how do you optimally choose for each available slot?  Below is an outline of a hill-climbing algorithm to identify favorable pairs:

1. Initialization: Start with an initial choice of parameters.
2. Evaluation: Simulate the expression and get the fitness.
3. Selection: Identify neighboring combinations by randomly choosing a different parameter from a randomly picked option.
4. Comparison: Re-simulate the updated expression and get the fitness.
5. Update: If a neighboring expression shows improved fitness, update the current choice to this new parameter set.
6. Iteration: Repeat the evaluation, selection, comparison, and update steps until no further improvements for 10 iterations.

By employing this algorithm, we can systematically improve the performance of the Alpha template.
However, there may be several obvious inductive biases in this framework. Have you noticed them? How can one further improve this framework? 🤔

Any suggestion on which datacategory / dataset this template is more suitable..

You may simply find any analyst dataset that has estimate and actual value at the same time.

Simply using fitness for screening at every step can easily lead to overfitting.  I believe different criteria at various stages could help avoid this issue, enhancing model generalization   .

Interestingly enough, fitness doesn't necessary linked to overfitting. Whether overfit or not depends on the algorithm, at least for most of the time.

As for your thought on "different criteria" on various stages, this is an interesting topic to discuss. Normally, it will require domain knowledge to design "different steps" and different "fitness function". This domain knowledge, however, could sometimes lead to human bias in your Alpha machine, and may not generalize well in other template or datasets.

@ [YW42946](/hc/en-us/profiles/12485882527255-YW42946)

Thank you for the framework and the interesting discussion!

Even in machine research, I tend to use the "sensible", discrete time series parameters like [5,10, 20, 60, 90,250] in the search. Maybe not always, but can it lead to a large human bias in machine research? Also, any pointers on how to best optimize in such a limited search space?

Cheers!

[NS94943](/hc/en-us/profiles/4557122515863-NS94943)

IMO, whether sensible or not depends on the "domain" knowledge of the targeted market anomaly. We can come up with two separate cases to discuss:

1. In Classical Mean-Reversion Signals

As you probably known, mean-reversion signals work best in short-term time periods. Hence, it makes sense to consider days such as [5, 10, 15, 20, 42, 63]. Days longer than that maybe conflicting to your original hypothesis and could potentially lead to in-efficiency.

2. In Fundamental Driven Data

If you are capturing changes in fundamental data, then it makes more sense to consider days beyond just a quarter, because that is the frequency of the data getting refreshed.

My point is, you have to understand what you want to have, and how is that reflecting in your search space. What is "biased" in one's mind, could be the "domain knowledge" of another.

Finally, the question "limited search space" is interesting. You may think that limiting that to "sensible candidates" limits the number of possible Alpha expression. But there are a lot of moving parts in the expression. For example, the templated mentioned in the article has at least (5 ^ 9) possible permutations. But that is perhaps a question for another article some days : )

Thank you  [YW42946](/hc/en-us/profiles/12485882527255-YW42946) .

It looks clearer now that we can look at it from the point-of-view of different kinds of signal. Looking forward to you next article on this question.

Thank you for providing such a detailed and insightful approach to optimizing Alpha templates. Your explanation of the hill-climbing algorithm, coupled with the suggestions for improvements, is truly valuable. I appreciate the clarity in presenting the potential biases and how to overcome them. It’s a fantastic contribution!

### 评论 #9 (作者: XD81759, 时间: 1 year ago)

Hey, YW42946! Nice post, man. One obvious inductive bias here might be that the hill-climbing algorithm could get stuck in local optima instead of finding the global best. Also, relying too much on random selection for neighboring combinations might miss out on some potentially good ones. To improve it, we could incorporate more intelligent search strategies like simulated annealing. And maybe add some constraints or priors based on our domain knowledge to guide the parameter selection better. Just my two cents.

**Hey  [XD81759](/hc/en-us/profiles/23494746482967-XD81759) , you've got some good points there. The local optima issue with hill-climbing is indeed a problem. And using simulated annealing as an alternative search strategy is a smart thought. Also, adding domain knowledge-based constraints can really help guide parameter selection better. Maybe we could test these improvements in practice and see how they impact the Alpha template's performance.**

### 评论 #13 (作者: BA51127, 时间: 1 year ago)

The systematic approach of the hill-climbing algorithm is commendable for its ability to iteratively improve Alpha templates. However, the risk of getting stuck in local optima is a valid concern. Introducing more sophisticated search strategies, such as simulated annealing, and incorporating domain knowledge-based constraints could further refine the optimization process. Testing these enhancements in practice could yield significant improvements in Alpha template performance.

This is a great explanation of how the hill-climbing algorithm can be applied to optimize Alpha templates. The step-by-step approach makes it clear how you can systematically improve performance. However, as you pointed out, the risk of local optima and overfitting is real. It might be worth incorporating techniques like random restarts or simulated annealing to explore more possibilities and avoid getting stuck in suboptimal solutions. Also, multi-objective optimization could help ensure the alpha performs well across different market conditions. I'm excited to see how this approach evolves!

@ [YW42946](/hc/en-us/profiles/12485882527255-YW42946) , Also, I would like to ask about the processing data in the template. If the act_data or est_data is absent, would you consider these stocks should not be traded?

### 评论 #17 (作者: PT27687, 时间: 1 year ago)

This is a fascinating approach to parameter optimization within the Alpha template! The hill-climbing algorithm you've outlined seems practical for fine-tuning the performance. I'm curious about how you would handle cases where the fitness landscape is quite complex and perhaps has multiple local maxima. Have you considered any strategies for escaping local optima during the iteration process?

---

### 评论 #18 (作者: LR13671, 时间: 9 months ago)

What do you think are the most effective strategies to prevent the hill-climbing algorithm from getting trapped in local optima, while ensuring the Alpha template maintains its generalization across different datasets and market regimes?
