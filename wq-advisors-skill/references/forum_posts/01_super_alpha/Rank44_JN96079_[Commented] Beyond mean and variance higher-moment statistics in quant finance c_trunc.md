For instance, the "tailedness" or extremity of returns within a rolling window is measured by ts_co_kurtosis.
The asymmetry of return distributions over time is measured by ts_co_skewness.point_right: In alpha design, how are ts_co_kurtosis and ts_co_skewness utilised?
Do you think they work better as features in conjunction with volatility or returns, or as independent predictive signals?

Another angle is horizon selection: short-window skewness tends to pick up sentiment shocks, while long-window measures align more with structural factors. Mixing the two sometimes improves stability.

Thanks for raising this 👏. Would love to hear from others here: when you’ve used skewness/kurtosis, did they improve Sharpe directly, or mostly help reduce correlation with existing signals?

Great question! I’ve seen ts_co_skewness work well when combined with volatility signals, since skewness often adds context to the risk profile. ts_co_kurtosis can sometimes act as a standalone signal, but in practice I find it more stable when used alongside return dispersion measures. Curious to hear how others integrate them.

That’s a very sharp question. Using  **ts_co_kurtosis**  and  **ts_co_skewness**  (i.e., rolling co-kurtosis/co-skewness between returns of a given stock and some benchmark or factor) is a more exotic/second-order extension beyond simple mean/variance models. They attempt to capture how a stock “co-exhibits” extreme tails or asymmetry relative to the benchmark. Below is how I’d think about their use (in practice and in the context of alpha design), and trade-offs.

## Intuition & potential use cases

### *What information do they bring?*

- ***t***  ***s_co_skewness(y, x, d)*** : If returns of y (say, a stock) tend to skew more positively (or negatively) when x  (say, market or factor) has positive returns (or negative) in the trailing window, that is a cross-asymmetry signal. For instance, when the market rallies, some stocks may have more upside skew (i.e., occasional outperformance in extreme up moves) than in down markets. This can provide insight into “tail beta” or asymmetry of sensitivity under stress scenarios.

- ***ts_co_kurtosis(y, x, d)*** : This captures the co-“tailedness,” i.e., whether y tends to have more extreme returns (large deviations) when x is also more extreme, over the window. Stocks whose returns co-kurtose strongly with the market may be more “crisis-sensitive” or prone to tail events. In effect, it's capturing cross-tail dependence: do extreme market moves amplify extreme stock moves beyond linear correlation/variance?

- These are potentially richer features than just plain covariance or correlation; they attempt to capture non-Gaussian higher moments.

TS_Co_Skewness works well with volatility signals, adding risk context, while TS_Co_Kurtosis is sometimes standalone but more stable alongside return dispersion. Integrating both thoughtfully can enhance signal robustness across different market conditions.

Interesting discussion!
Higher-moment measures like  **ts_co_skewness**  and  **ts_co_kurtosis**  really shine when paired with volatility or tail-risk factors—they reveal return asymmetry and extreme-move dependence that plain variance misses.
I’ve found skewness useful for spotting upside vs downside sensitivity, while co-kurtosis flags names that “blow up” with the market.
Do you typically treat them as direct alpha inputs or more as risk filters to shape exposure?
Curious if anyone has compared their predictive value across different look-back windows or asset classes.

TS_Co_Skewness pairs effectively with volatility-based signals to provide additional risk context, whereas TS_Co_Kurtosis can be used independently or alongside return dispersion for stability. Thoughtful integration of both operators can improve signal robustness across varying market conditions.
