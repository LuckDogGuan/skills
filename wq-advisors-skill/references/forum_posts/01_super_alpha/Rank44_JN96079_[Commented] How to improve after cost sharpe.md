After cost performance play very important role in genius levels.

After cost  combined alpha sharpe is performance after the constraints applied on it.

I will share some tips to improve after cost performance of your pool:

1.) to improve after cost sharpe focus on better implementation don't try to reduce overfitting.

2.) turnover play very important role try to reduce avg turnover below 20 or 15.

3.) use max_trade as on to reduce exposure of illiquidity.

To improve the  **after-cost Sharpe** , which reflects alpha performance after real-world trading constraints, you should focus on practical implementation. Avoid overfitting and instead aim for lower turnover (ideally below 20 or even 15). Also, enabling  `max_trade = on`  helps reduce exposure to illiquid assets, enhancing real-world viability and Genius scores.

Great points! I’ve also seen that smoothing signals (e.g., using decay) can reduce whipsaws and help lower turnover naturally. Has anyone tested the tradeoff between signal sharpness and turnover decay in practice? Would love to hear how you balance that for better after-cost Sharpe.

One additional point is to monitor universe selection and signal stability volatile or niche universes can spike turnover unpredictably. Even if turnover appears low in backtests, shifts in liquidity or sector weights can distort post-cost metrics in production.

There are many ideas to improve after-cost Sharpe, and your approach is also a good solution.

Personally, I look forward to Brain providing an official formula for calculating After Cost (similar to the formula for calculating Combined, for example), as this would make improvement solutions much more effective and accurate.

There are several ways to enhance after-cost Sharpe, and your method is effective. Personally, I  have been looking   to Brain introducing an official After-Cost formula, similar to the Combined score. it  can greatly improve the consistency and accuracy of strategy evaluation by clearly accounting for trading costs, making it easier to refine and optimize alpha signals.

Thanks for sharing these useful tips! After cost Sharpe is very important in improving Genius level. To make it better, we should focus on smoother implementation rather than overfitting. Also, keeping average turnover low (below 20 or 15) helps reduce trading costs. Turning on  *max_trade*  is a smart way to avoid high exposure to illiquid stocks. These small changes can bring big improvements. Great insights for everyone working on their alpha pools.

I particularly like the direct advice:

- **Focus on better implementation, not just reducing overfitting:**  This is a crucial distinction. An overfit alpha might look great on paper, but poor implementation (e.g., high transaction costs) will kill its real-world performance. This suggests optimizing for practical trade execution rather than just in-sample R-squared.
- **Targeting low average turnover (below 15-20%):**  This is a very concrete and actionable goal. Turnover is often the biggest drain on after-cost returns, so setting a clear target like this is excellent advice.
- **Using  `max_trade`  for illiquidity exposure:**  A smart way to manage risk, especially for larger pools or less liquid assets.

### My Question for Discussion:

Beyond the average turnover, do you find that the  *distribution*  of turnover (e.g., occasional very high spikes vs. consistently moderate turnover) has a more significant impact on After-Cost Sharpe? And if so, what strategies or operators do you find most effective in smoothing out those high turnover peaks?

That turnover tip is so crucial. It's easy to build an alpha that looks amazing on paper (before cost), but if it's trading in and out constantly, the costs just kill it in the real world. I had to learn that the hard way. A low-turnover, steady signal is almost always better than a noisy, high-frequency one.

In the Power Pool Leaderboard, the metrics BC Combo IR and AC Combo IR are used to measure how well your alpha performs when combined with others in a portfolio context.

BC Combo IR stands for Backtest Combination Information Ratio. It reflects the performance of your alpha when added to a set of other alphas during historical backtesting. A high BC Combo IR indicates that your alpha contributes positively by adding diversification, improving risk-adjusted returns.

AC Combo IR stands for Actual Combination Information Ratio, and it measures how your alpha performs in live or recent simulations within the actual alpha pool. This shows your alpha’s real-world effectiveness and how well it complements others under current market conditions.

These scores help identify alphas that may not rank highest individually but offer strong value when combined. To improve these metrics, focus on creating unique, low-correlation alphas that enhance the diversity of the portfolio.

First of all, it is a composite indicator, so it can make a positive contribution by starting with diversification and improving risk-adjusted returns

### 评论 #15 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 1年前)

On the Power Pool Leaderboard, two key metrics— **BC Combo IR**  and  **AC Combo IR** —are used to evaluate how effectively your alpha integrates into a broader portfolio.

**BC Combo IR**  (Backtest Combination Information Ratio) assesses your alpha's contribution during historical simulations. A high BC Combo IR suggests that your alpha improved the backtested portfolio by enhancing diversification and boosting risk-adjusted returns. It reflects how your signal would have performed in combination with others during past market conditions.

**AC Combo IR**  (Actual Combination Information Ratio), on the other hand, measures your alpha’s performance in recent or live simulations—capturing its effectiveness within the actual Power Pool under current conditions. This gives a more real-time view of how well your alpha complements others.

These metrics highlight alphas that, while not always top performers on their own, add meaningful value in combination. To boost these scores, focus on building uncorrelated, structurally distinct alphas that strengthen overall portfolio diversity and robustness.

Thanks for the helpful tips! Improving after-cost Sharpe is key for Genius level. Focus on smoother implementation, keep average turnover below 15–20, and enable max_trade to reduce exposure to illiquid stocks—small tweaks, big impact.

---

### 评论 #17 (作者: RB90992, 时间: 1年前)

To improve after-cost Sharpe, reduce portfolio turnover by smoothing or lagging signals, and avoid trading on noisy, short-lived alphas. Focus on high-quality, stable signals with strong predictive power and low correlation to each other. Optimize positions using cost-aware models that penalize transaction costs, slippage, and impact. Trade liquid assets to reduce spread-related losses and apply volume constraints to avoid excessive market impact. Ensure your backtests simulate realistic execution costs. Regularize positions to maintain sector, beta, and volatility neutrality. Overall, prioritize signal efficiency and execution efficiency to preserve returns after costs while maintaining manageable portfolio risk.

After-cost performance is crucial for advancing in Genius levels, as it reflects how well your alpha performs after accounting for trading costs and constraints. The  **after-cost combined alpha Sharpe**  measures this net effectiveness. To improve it:

1. **Focus on better implementation**  rather than just reducing overfitting—ensure your signals are practical and executable.
2. **Keep average turnover low** —ideally below 20 or 15—to minimize trading costs and improve stability.
3. **Set  `max_trade`  to  `on`**  to limit trades in illiquid stocks, reducing slippage and protecting performance.

If you're aiming to boost your after-cost Sharpe, think implementation-first. Keep turnover low—under 20 is good, under 15 is even better. And don’t forget to turn  `max_trade = on`  to stay away from illiquid assets. It helps in the real world and gives your Genius score a solid lift.

### 评论 #20 (作者: PY38056, 时间: 1年前)

Nice tips! After-cost Sharpe is crucial for real-world performance. Focusing on implementation, managing turnover, and using max_trade smartly can significantly boost efficiency and reduce slippage in execution.

### 评论 #21 (作者: SG91420, 时间: 1年前)

It acts as an amazing reminder that Genius levels are largely determined by after-cost performance, particularly after limitations like turnover and max trade. The idea that improving implementation is more important than merely lowering overfitting struck me as especially wise. Additionally, limiting turnover to 15–20 and managing illiquidity risk with max_trade=on are sensible tactics that I will undoubtedly take into account in my upcoming alpha designs. Thank you very much!

### 评论 #22 (作者: NP65801, 时间: 1年前)

To improve after-cost Sharpe, reduce transaction costs by lowering turnover, using smarter execution strategies, or trading more liquid assets. Refine your alpha to maintain strong signals with fewer trades. Regularize or simplify the model to avoid noise. Focus on stable, persistent signals that perform well net of costs.

### 评论 #24 (作者: AK98027, 时间: 1年前)

After-cost performance is crucial but often underestimated. Thoughtful implementation, controlling turnover, and optimizing the  `max_trade`  constraint can significantly preserve alpha value. It’s not just about generating strong signals, but also about making them tradeable in real-world conditions. These practical adjustments really separate a good alpha from a great one.

You’ve captured it perfectly—BC Combo IR and AC Combo IR really emphasize the value of alphas as part of a cohesive ensemble, not just standalone performers.

**BC Combo IR**  measures how your alpha would have enhanced the historical portfolio’s risk-adjusted returns by adding diversification and reducing redundancy in backtests. It’s a good proxy for the alpha’s structural contribution over past market regimes.

**AC Combo IR**  reflects the alpha’s contribution in the current, live Power Pool environment—showing how well it actually plays with others under today’s market dynamics and the existing alpha mix.

Because these metrics reward complementary signals, the best way to improve them is by building alphas that are both  **structurally distinct**  and  **low-correlated**  to your other submissions. This encourages robust portfolio diversification, making the whole stronger than the sum of its parts.

Do you have particular strategies or signal families you lean on to achieve that low correlation and structural uniqueness?

### 评论 #26 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 10个月前)

Exactly—you’ve captured the distinction well. BC Combo IR and AC Combo IR highlight an alpha’s value not in isolation, but as part of a broader ensemble.

BC Combo IR (Backtest Combination IR) gauges how an alpha would have improved historical portfolios by adding diversification and reducing redundancy—essentially its structural contribution over past market regimes. AC Combo IR (Actual Combination IR) measures its real-time effectiveness within the live Power Pool, showing how well it interacts with the current alpha mix under today’s market conditions.

To boost these metrics, the key is crafting alphas that are both structurally distinct and low-correlated with your existing pool. This encourages true diversification, letting the ensemble outperform any individual component.

Do you focus on specific operator families or signal transformations to achieve that low correlation and structural uniqueness in your alphas?

Improving after-cost Sharpe focuses on reducing friction and stabilizing returns, not just boosting raw alpha:

Lower turnover: Use longer lookbacks, smoother decays, or operators like ts_step to avoid excessive trading.

Simplify signals: Remove noisy transformations; robust, monotonic signals survive costs better.

Optimize decay: Match signal half-life to holding period to reduce churn.

Improve orthogonality: Reduce correlation with existing alphas to avoid internal crossing costs.

Refine neutralization: Neutralize only necessary risk factors; over-neutralization increases trades.

Filter weak trades: Trade only top/bottom ranks or add thresholds to skip low-conviction signals.
