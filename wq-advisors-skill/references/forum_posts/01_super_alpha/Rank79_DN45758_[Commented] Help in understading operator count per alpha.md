Can someone help me to understand how many operator will be counted in below expression.

A = datafield1 ;

rank(A)+rank(ts_delay(A,250))

total operators = 3 (rank, rank, ts_delay) or 2 ( rank, ts_delay)

There will be 3 operators counted in your alpha. Good luck finding a better way to implement alpha.

hi  [SK78969](/hc/en-us/profiles/1531055428142-SK78969) , As I understand, rank() will help to allocate weight from 0-1 in your portfolio, rank(ts_delay(,d)) is you will take data of d days ago and allocate weight from 0-1. Since both are matrix, when you do the addition, your alpha will be able to understand 0.5*rank() + 0.5*(rank(ts_delay))

```

Hi,

For the  **Genius Leaderboard** , the following three operators will be counted as  *Average operators* :

1. `rank`
2. `+`  (addition)
3. `ts_delay`

For  **PowerPool alphas** , there are  **four**  operators considered:

- `rank`  will count as  **2 operators** ,
- `+`  and  `ts_delay`  will each count as  **1 operator** .

I hope this clarifies your query.

They are two different operators in that alpha but total for the genius programme will be counted as 3 alphas. Since there is a repetition of alpha the rank operator.

What are you guys talking about? 😅

It’s clearly  **three operators for the Genius Program** , but  **four for Power Pool Alphas** .
And yes,  **PPAs do count reused operators**  toward the total.

I’ve looked into this before—operators are usually counted based on function calls. In your expression, it’s 3 operators:  `rank` , another  `rank` , and  `ts_delay` . Even though  `rank`  repeats, each instance counts separately. So yes, total operators = 3. Repeats are still included in the count.

From what I understand,  `rank()`  assigns weights between 0 and 1 across your portfolio. When you use  `rank(ts_delay(, d))` , you're applying the rank to data from  *d*  days ago, again producing values between 0 and 1. Since both return matrices, adding them—like in  `0.5 * rank() + 0.5 * rank(ts_delay())` —lets your alpha combine both signals effectively.

### 评论 #9 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 1年前)

I’ve looked into this before, and it seems that the number of operators is determined by the count of function calls in your expression. Even if a function appears multiple times, each use is counted individually. For example, in an expression like  `0.5 * rank(x) + 0.5 * rank(ts_delay(x, d))` , there are three distinct operators: two instances of  `rank()`  and one  `ts_delay()` . So, in total, it counts as three operators. As for how the functions work,  `rank()`  transforms the values across stocks into a 0 to 1 scale, and  `ts_delay(x, d)`  retrieves the value of  `x`  from  `d`  days ago. When you apply  `rank()`  to that delayed data, you get a ranked version of past values. Combining them with weighted averages helps smooth the signal and can enhance stability. This kind of structure often leads to more robust alphas.

Have you tried adjusting the delay or weight to see how it affects turnover or performance?

For the Genius program, repeated operators are not counted, so the count would be 2. However, if you're referring to Power Pool Alpha (PPA), then the count would be 3, as repeated operators are still taken into account.

For the  **Genius Leaderboard** , the following operator counts apply:

- `rank`  → counts as  **1**  operator
- `+`  (addition) → counts as  **1**  operator
- `ts_delay`  → counts as  **1**  operator

So all three are considered  **average operators** .

For  **PowerPool Alphas** , the counting is slightly different:

- `rank`  → counts as  **2**  operators
- `+`  and  `ts_delay`  → each count as  **1**  operator

Hope this clears things up!

### 评论 #13 (作者: RK48711, 时间: 1年前)

In the context of the Genius Leaderboard, the operators  *rank* ,  *addition (+)* , and  *ts_delay*  are treated as average operators. However, for PowerPool alphas, the counting differs:  *rank*  is weighted as 2 operators, while  *+*  and  *ts_delay*  are each counted as 1. Hope this provides clarity.

### 评论 #14 (作者: VP21767, 时间: 1年前)

As i know, rank(rank(a)) will be counted 2 operators and same with the others. And for sure about this one, you can check API your alpha, it will count operator your alpha too.

---

### 评论 #15 (作者: NS62681, 时间: 1年前)

In your example, there are three: one call to  `rank` , another separate call to  `rank` , and one to  `ts_delay` . Even if the same function is used multiple times, each instance is counted individually. So yes, the total operator count is 3, including repeated functions.

### 评论 #16 (作者: 顾问 TN48242 (Rank 82), 时间: 1年前)

Good question! In your expression:

python

Sao chépChỉnh sửa

`rank(A) + rank(ts_delay(A, 250))
`

the total operator count is three for Genius Leaderboard: two  `rank`  operators and one  `ts_delay` . Even though  `rank`  repeats, each instance is counted separately. The addition ( `+` ) is often not counted as a distinct operator in Genius but may be included for PowerPool, making the count four there.

So, in Genius:  `rank`  +  `rank`  +  `ts_delay`  = 3.
In PowerPool:  `rank`  (x2) +  `ts_delay`  +  `+`  = 4.

Always check operator limits and duplication rules when building alphas.

### 评论 #17 (作者: TP85668, 时间: 1年前)

The total operator count is  **3** :

- `rank()`  → 1
- `ts_delay()`  → 1
- `rank(ts_delay(...))`  → another  `rank()`  → 1

So it’s:  **rank + ts_delay + rank = 3 operators** .

---

### 评论 #18 (作者: AK52014, 时间: 1年前)

As I understand it, rank() assigns weights from 0 to 1. Using rank(ts_delay(, d)) applies this to past data. Combining them, like 0.5 * rank() + 0.5 * rank(ts_delay()), merges both signals effectively.

---

### 评论 #19 (作者: HT71201, 时间: 1年前)

In the Genius program, repeated operators are not counted, so the total is 2. However, in the case of Power Pool Alpha, repeated operators are included in the count, making the total 3.

### 评论 #20 (作者: SK90981, 时间: 1年前)

The following operator counts are applicable for the Genius Leaderboard:

The operator rank → counts as one.

+ (addition) → is equivalent to one operator.

The operator ts_delay → counts as one.

Thus, each of the three is regarded as an average operator.

The counting for PowerPool Alphas is a little different:

The operators rank → counts as two.

Each of the operators + and ts_delay → counts as one.

I hope this makes sense!

---

### 评论 #21 (作者: AG14039, 时间: 1年前)

From what I understand,  `rank()`  scales values between 0 and 1, while  `rank(ts_delay(, d))`  applies this ranking to data from  `d`  days ago. When you combine them—like  `0.5 * rank() + 0.5 * rank(ts_delay())` —you’re blending current and past signals to create a more balanced alpha.

---

### 评论 #22 (作者: LR13671, 时间: 1年前)

For the  **Genius Leaderboard** , each unique function/operator used is counted only once. Thus,  `rank` ,  `ts_delay` , and  `+`  (addition) would total  **3 average operators** , even if  `rank`  is repeated.

---

### 评论 #23 (作者: SD92473, 时间: 1年前)

Hi, As per the given expression, 3 operators rank, ts_delay and + will be considered only.

---

### 评论 #24 (作者: RP41479, 时间: 1年前)

In your example, there are three operators: two separate  `rank`  calls and one  `ts_delay` . Each function call counts individually, even if repeated—so the total operator count is 3.

### 评论 #25 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 1年前)

In the expression  `A = datafield1; rank(A) + rank(ts_delay(A, 250))` , the total number of operators is counted based on the distinct operations applied to the datafields. In this case,  `rank`  is applied twice—once to  `A`  and once to  `ts_delay(A, 250)` . Since  `rank`  is considered an operator, it counts as two individual operations.  `ts_delay`  is also an operator on the datafield  `A` , so it counts as one additional operation. Therefore, the total number of operators is 3: two  `rank`  operations and one  `ts_delay`  operation. It’s essential to track these operators because they affect the complexity of the alpha and the computational cost when it’s being deployed in a strategy.

### 评论 #26 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 1年前)

When calculating operator counts for the Genius Leaderboard, it’s important to understand how each operator is treated. The operators  `rank` ,  `+`  (addition), and  `ts_delay`  each count as 1 operator in the standard Genius scoring system. These are all considered average in complexity and frequency of use.

However, when it comes to Power Pool Alphas, the counting rules are slightly stricter to encourage simplicity and uniqueness. In this case, the  `rank`  operator is weighted more heavily and counts as 2 operators, while  `+`  and  `ts_delay`  still count as 1 operator each. This difference reflects the need to avoid overly common structures and promote diversity in Power Pool submissions.

Understanding how operators are scored helps optimize your alpha structure, especially when balancing between maximizing your Genius metrics and qualifying for Power Pool selection. Have you considered reworking any alphas with frequent  `rank`  usage to optimize your Power Pool eligibility and operator score?

### 评论 #27 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 1年前)

Understanding how operators are counted is important for both the Genius Leaderboard and Power Pool submissions, as it directly impacts the alpha’s complexity and evaluation. For the Genius Leaderboard, basic operators like  `rank` ,  `+` , and  `ts_delay`  each count as one operator. So in this context, an expression like  `rank(A) + rank(ts_delay(A, 250))`  involves three operators: two instances of  `rank`  and one  `ts_delay` .

However, for  **Power Pool Alphas** , the counting method is slightly different:  `rank`  counts as  **two operators** , while  `+`  and  `ts_delay`  still count as one each. Using the same example, the Power Pool version would register  **four operators total**  — two for  `rank(rank(...))` , one for  `ts_delay` , and one for the addition.

Tracking operator counts is essential because it influences both performance metrics and tie-breaker criteria. Keeping your average operator count low while maintaining alpha quality is a smart way to score better and optimize your strategy efficiently.

### 评论 #28 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 1年前)

I’ve looked into this before as well, and you're absolutely right—the number of operators in an alpha expression is based on individual function calls, not uniqueness. In your example,  `0.5 * rank(x) + 0.5 * rank(ts_delay(x, d))` , the system counts three operators: two separate  `rank()`  calls and one  `ts_delay()` . Each instance adds to the operator count, regardless of repetition.

Functionally,  `rank()`  normalizes data across the stock universe, converting raw values into percentile ranks from 0 to 1. Meanwhile,  `ts_delay(x, d)`  fetches the value of  `x`  from  *d*  days prior. Applying  `rank()`  to delayed values allows you to analyze how past conditions compare across stocks, often improving temporal stability. Combining multiple signals through weighted averages like in your example can smooth volatility and potentially lower turnover—though exact effects depend on delay lengths and weight balances.

Have you experimented with shorter vs. longer delays or uneven weighting? The trade-off between responsiveness and stability is often where performance gains are found.

For the  **Genius Leaderboard** :

- `rank`  = 1 operator
- `+`  (addition) = 1 operator
- `ts_delay`  = 1 operator

For  **PowerPool Alphas** :

- `rank`  = 2 operators
- `+`  = 1 operator
- `ts_delay`  = 1 operator

So  `rank`  is weighted more heavily in PowerPool, affecting operator budget differently across platforms.

### 评论 #30 (作者: MY83791, 时间: 1年前)

For the  **Genius Leaderboard and powerpool alphas the calculation is different**

For the  **Genius Leaderboard** each unique function/operator used is counted only once. Thus, there are 3 operators.

But for powerpool even the repeats are counted so effectively 4 (2 rank, ts_delay and +)

---

### 评论 #31 (作者: DG92378, 时间: 1年前)

Very helpful for the Powerpool alpha creation clarification

### 评论 #32 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 10个月前)

I’ve looked into this too, and you’re right—the operator count in an alpha expression depends on the total number of function calls, not just unique ones. For example, in 0.5 * rank(x) + 0.5 * rank(ts_delay(x, d)), there are three operators counted: two rank() calls and one ts_delay(). Each occurrence adds to the total regardless of repetition.

Rank() normalizes values across the universe by converting raw data into percentile ranks from 0 to 1. Ts_delay(x, d) retrieves the value of x from d days ago. Applying rank to delayed data helps compare past conditions across stocks and often boosts temporal stability. Combining signals with weighted averages can smooth fluctuations and reduce turnover, though results vary by delay length and weights.

Have you tried different delay lengths or unequal weights? Finding the right balance between responsiveness and stability is key for improving performance.

Also, operator counting differs slightly between Genius Leaderboard and Power Pool—rank counts as one or two operators respectively, which affects evaluation and scoring.

### 评论 #33 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 10个月前)

You’re correct—the operator count in an alpha expression depends on  **each function call** , not uniqueness. In your example:

```
0.5 * rank(x) + 0.5 * rank(ts_delay(x, d))

```

there are  **three operators** : two separate  `rank()`  calls and one  `ts_delay()` . Each instance adds to the count, regardless of repetition. Functionally,  `rank()`  normalizes values across the universe (0–1 percentile), while  `ts_delay(x, d)`  fetches the value of  `x`  from  `d`  days ago. Applying  `rank()`  to delayed values helps compare past conditions across stocks, often improving stability. Weighted combinations like this can smooth volatility and potentially reduce turnover, though effects depend on delay lengths and weights.

For  **Power Pool Alphas** , the counting differs slightly: each  `rank()`  counts as  **two operators** , while  `+`  and  `ts_delay()`  count as one each—so the same expression would register  **four operators** . Balancing operator count with alpha quality is key for scoring efficiently.
