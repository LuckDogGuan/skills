Hello everyone,may I ask how I can use the vector_neut operater?

I have seen some cases such as vector_neut(x, risk_factors). What exactly does risk_factors refer to here? Is Beta Risk Factors one of them in  WQ? which factors can replace risk_factors?Thank you very much.

Great question! In  `vector_neut(x, risk_factors)` , the  `risk_factors`  input usually refers to style or industry exposures like Beta, Size, Momentum, Value, etc.—similar to Barra-style factors. Yes, Beta can definitely be one of them. You can try neutralizing against any vector you believe introduces unwanted bias

The  `vector_neut`  operator is used to  **neutralize an expression  `x`  against a set of multiple risk factors simultaneously** .

- `x` : your alpha signal (e.g., a ranking or score).
- `risk_factors` : a  *vector*  or list of fields that represent the risks you want to neutralize away.

Great question!  `vector_neut(x, risk_factors)`  removes the part of  `x`  that's linearly explained by  `risk_factors` , making the output orthogonal to them. This helps reduce unintended exposures — for example, to market beta or sector risk.

As for  `risk_factors` , they can be a single vector (like  `returns` ) or a set of custom-built exposures (e.g.,  `group_mean(cap, sector)`  for size, or  `group_mean(returns, industry)`  for industry momentum). Yes, beta-related factors can be used — especially if you want to neutralize your alpha against market direction.

It's a powerful tool when you're trying to isolate pure alpha signals. Anyone else here tried using multiple vectors in  `risk_factors`  together?

" `vector_neut(x, risk_factors)`  is used to make the output vector  `x`  neutral to specified risk factors. These risk factors could be industry, sub-industry, or style factors like market beta, volatility, or market cap.
For example, using  `vector_neut(my_alpha, beta_last_360_days_spy)`  removes market beta exposure. Which risk factor to use depends on your hypothesis and what you want to neutralize. Beta risk factors are commonly used to remove systematic market risk."

Hi ,

You can use the vector_neut operator using the following expression  `vector_neut(x, y). It`  applies a cross-sectional operator that neutralizes vector  `x`  with respect to vector  `y` . This helps remove biases and makes the results more consistent across different alphas.

Thanks for the helpful insights! It’s clear that vector_neut is useful for removing biases like beta or sector exposure. Knowing that we can neutralize using vectors like size, volatility, or even group means makes it a powerful tool for refining alpha signals and ensuring cleaner, more targeted performance.

`vector_neut(x, risk_factors)`  helps clean up your signal by making sure  `x`  isn’t driven by known risk factors like sector, beta, or market cap. It’s a great way to isolate the unique part of your alpha.

## Vector Neutralization Operator:  `vector_neut(x,y)`

**Function:**  Input1 neutralized to Input2

**Mathematical Process:**

1. **Projects**  vector A (input1) onto vector B (input2)
2. **Subtracts**  the projection from A to create orthogonal vector A'
3. **Results**  in A' being perpendicular to B (correlation ≈ 0)

**Formula:**   `A' = A - (A·B/B·B) × B`

## Practical Applications in Alpha Construction:

### Example 1: Market Beta Neutralization

```
vector_neut(alpha_signal, market_returns)
```

**Purpose:**  Remove market exposure from alpha signal, creating market-neutral returns

### Example 2: Sector Neutralization

```
vector_neut(fundamental_score, sector_returns)
```

**Purpose:**  Eliminate sector bias, focusing on stock selection within sectors

### Example 3: Size Factor Neutralization

```
vector_neut(momentum_signal, market_cap)
```

**Purpose:**  Remove size bias from momentum strategy

### Example 4: Risk Factor Control

```
vector_neut(value_alpha, volatility_factor)
```

**Purpose:**  Create volatility-neutral value signal

## Key Benefits:

- **Reduces unwanted correlations**  between alpha and risk factors
- **Improves risk-adjusted returns**  by removing systematic exposures
- **Enhances alpha purity**  by isolating desired signal from confounding factors
- **Enables factor-neutral strategies**  for institutional requirements

## Usage Considerations:

- **Order matters** :  `vector_neut(A,B)`  ≠  `vector_neut(B,A)`
- **Information loss** : Neutralization removes some signal content
- **Orthogonality** : Output is mathematically perpendicular to neutralization factor
- **Risk management** : Essential for controlling unintended factor exposures

This operator is particularly valuable for institutional strategies requiring specific factor neutrality while preserving alpha generation capability.
