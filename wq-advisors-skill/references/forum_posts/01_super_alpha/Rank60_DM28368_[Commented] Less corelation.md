No data can reduce your correlation if you spam one model. You can try harder dataset such as nws, inst,... Moreover, creation is one of the most important way to decrease your correlation.

Use orthogonal data like vol term structure, order flow, macro filters, and dealer positioning to reduce alpha correlation and diversify signal sources for better overall performance.

To enhance Combined Alpha Performance and Combined Selected Alpha Performance, consider implementing a dynamic approach to alpha selection and weighting. Regularly evaluate the performance of your alphas using real-time metrics and adjust their weights based on short-term performance trends, which can help optimize returns while minimizing risk. Additionally, integrating diverse data sources and employing rigorous backtesting across various market conditions will ensure that your strategies remain robust and adaptable.

Suppose you have two highly correlated features in your dataset, "Income" and "Expenditure". To reduce their correlation, you could:

- Use  **PCA**  to combine these features into a new uncorrelated component.
- Apply  **Lasso regression**  to eliminate one of the features.
- Aggregate them into a new composite feature, like "Savings" = "Income" - "Expenditure".

### **Techniques That Help in reduction of correlation as as per my knowledge:**

- Use  **different regions**  or  **different market caps** .
- Try  **D0 signals vs D1 signals**  (different timing = lower correlation).
- Apply  **non-linear operators**  like  `rank_decay` ,  `ts_covariance` , or  `group_vector_proj` .
- Neutralize against different  **industry groups** ,  **factors** , or  **macro variables**  using  `group_neutralize`  or  `regression_neutralize` .

To effectively reduce correlation among your alphas, consider leveraging diverse datasets that capture different market dynamics, such as macroeconomic indicators or sector-specific data. Additionally, employing non-linear operators like rank_decay or ts_covariance can help create more unique signals. Exploring D0 versus D1 signals can also introduce timing differences that lower correlation. Finally, applying neutralization techniques against various industry groups or macro variables can further enhance the diversity of your alpha portfolio, leading to improved overall performance.

I am also facing high prod correlation in my alphas and tried operators Ts_corvaricance but it takes time to simulate the alpha.

first you need to improve your single alpha, use less used fields, change neutralization, change decay then use combination functions, exploit new datasets will help you improve pro correlation.

To reduce alpha correlation, use diverse datasets (like macro and sector data), apply non-linear operators (e.g., rank_decay, ts_covariance) for unique signals, explore D0 versus D1 for timing differences, and neutralize against industry or macro factors.

### 评论 #10 (作者: SM35412, 时间: 1年前)

I agree that using different regions, market caps, or varying the timing (D0 vs. D1) can effectively diversify signals. Non-linear operators like rank_decay and ts_covariance also seem powerful for generating unique signals. The idea of neutralizing against industry groups or macro variables is intriguing, as it helps in making the signals more robust. I'm curious, though—how do you prioritize which macroeconomic indicators or sectors to focus on when applying neutralization techniques? Does this depend on the market environment or the asset class?

Go and check the Pyramid theme multiplier table in the genius section. The dataset having more multiplier is less used. You can get an idea and make the alphas with less production correlation easily.

Thanks

To reduce alpha correlation and enhance combined performance, avoid overusing a single model or dataset—spamming one logic leads to redundancy. Instead, explore harder, underutilized datasets like NWS or INST for unique insights. Apply advanced techniques like non-linear operators (e.g., rank_decay, ts_covariance) and time-shifted signals (D0 vs D1) to introduce structural variation. Use PCA or Lasso to manage internal feature redundancy. Create composite features and neutralize alphas against sectors, macro factors, or industries using group_neutralize or regression_neutralize. Dynamically adjust weights based on real-time performance, and continuously backtest across regimes. Innovation in data and signal construction is the key to low correlation.

Reduce alpha correlation by using diverse datasets (macroeconomic, sector-specific), applying non-linear operators (rank_decay, ts_covariance), exploring D0 vs D1 signals for timing differences, and using neutralization techniques against industry or macro factors to enhance alpha portfolio diversity and performance.

### 评论 #15 (作者: VA36844, 时间: 1年前)

You can look for datasets with fewer alphas and fewer users. Additionally, consider taking advantage of newer neutralization methods like STATISTICAL, as they tend to have lower correlation.

A lot of good points here — key takeaway: correlation reduction isn't just about new datasets, it's about  *differentiating logic* . Use less-explored data (check Pyramid multipliers), vary timing (D0 vs D1), apply non-linear operators like  `ts_covariance` , and neutralize thoughtfully (not just industry, try macro regimes or latent factors). Also, don’t ignore operator-layer creativity — a unique transformation can matter more than the dataset itself.

There are a large number of consultants, so idea overlap happens frequently. I think it's a good idea to leverage the Brain API to search for unique and uncommon Alpha patterns. Additionally, you can experiment with datasets that are less commonly used by checking them on the Data documentation page.

### 评论 #18 (作者: GK74217, 时间: 1年前)

I find the timing angle (D0 vs D1) especially valuable. Another dimension is to explore alphas with different holding periods (short-term vs mid-term logic). This introduces temporal decorrelation, especially if you're mixing signals with different lag structures and decay behaviors.

### 评论 #19 (作者: KK32415, 时间: 1年前)

I've also found that multi-horizon alpha construction helps reduce redundancy. Blending fast-decay mean-reversion with slower macro-driven signals can produce uncorrelated return streams even if they're built on similar datasets. The trick is to design decay profiles and signal horizons that don’t overlap e.g., 1-day vs. 5-day vs. 21-day holding periods.

Use diverse datasets, non-linear operators, timing shifts, and neutralization to reduce alpha correlation and boost portfolio performance.

Reducing correlation across alphas isn’t just about changing datasets—it’s about  **structural diversity in logic and construction** . While using underutilized datasets like  `nws` ,  `inst` , or  `macro`  helps, the real gain often comes from mixing  **different horizons (D0 vs D1)**  and  **non-linear transformations**  like  `ts_covariance` ,  `rank_decay` , or  `group_vector_proj` . I’ve seen success by combining slow, macro-themed signals with fast-reacting technical indicators, especially when decay structures are staggered (e.g., 5 vs. 21 days). Another strategy is to neutralize against latent risk factors beyond just sector/industry—like momentum or volatility regimes. Ultimately, low correlation comes from crafting orthogonal perspectives, not just rotating fields.

Thank you to everyone in this thread—there’s a wealth of practical advice here! As someone still learning how to diversify alpha construction effectively, the shared strategies around  **timing offsets (D0 vs D1)** ,  **non-linear operator use** , and  **exploring less popular datasets**  like  `inst`  or  `nws`  have been incredibly helpful. I especially appreciate the insight that  **creation logic matters more than just the data** —it’s easy to forget that even with new datasets, using the same model logic can still produce high correlation. These tips give me a clearer direction on how to design more robust, uncorrelated signals. Much appreciated!
