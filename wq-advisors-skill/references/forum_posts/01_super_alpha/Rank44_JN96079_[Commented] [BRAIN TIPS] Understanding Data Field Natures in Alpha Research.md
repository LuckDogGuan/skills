## 帖子正文

When building Alphas, a common hidden pitfall is treating all data fields as if they were of the same “type.” In reality, fields differ by scale, unit, direction, rawness, stability (e.g., price vs volume, per-share vs per-dollar, level vs change), etc. Intelligent Alpha design might start with matching the operator to the nature of the data.

Below are practical principles and examples you may start using in both - human research and when designing machine research.

**First Case: Per Share vs Per Volume vs Absolute Fields**

Examples:

-   Per-share: eps, dividend_per_share

-   Per-volume / per-turnover: metrics normalized by volume, ADV, or turnover

-   Absolute: market_cap, total_debt, sales, volume

**Why different treatment?**

-   Per-share fields are already size-adjusted; they’re better suited to cross-sectional comparisons without further scaling by size.

-   Absolute fields are skewed (for example, large vs small caps), so you often need log transforms and normalization before ranking.

-   Volume-related fields tend to be noisy, non-stationary, and heavy-tailed, so they often need smoothing and robustness operations.

Template ideas could be:

-   When using per-share and absolute fields together, convert one into a compatible scale first.

Example one: You may convert dollar into per-share before combining with per-share fundamentals

per_share_x = convert(x, mode="dollar2share")

Example two: When using absolute size fields (market_cap), you may try scaling:

Trying: Log and normalize large positive fields

size_log   = log(market_cap)

size_z     = zscore(size_log)

size_alpha = -rank(size_z)

Operators used: log, zscore, rank

**Second Case: Levels vs Changes vs Volatility of a Field**

A single data field can be used in multiple “modes”:

-   Level: is the value high or low? (e.g., current PE ratio)

-   Change: how fast is it moving? (e.g., one-year change in EPS)

-   Volatility / stability: how noisy is it? (e.g., volatility of data field)

Example one:

-   For stability of a field

Say for example, hypothesis could be : Low volatility of gross margin is “quality”

margin_vol   = ts_std_dev(gross_margin, 252)

Alpha        = -rank(margin_vol)   // more stable margins possibly preferred

Operators used: ts_std_dev, rank

This is an excellent point, VG85931. Recognizing the inherent nature of data fields, especially the distinction between per-share, per-volume, and absolute metrics, is crucial for effective alpha development. I've found that explicitly addressing non-stationarity in volume data with rolling averages or EWMA can significantly improve signal robustness. Do you find certain smoothing windows work particularly well for common volume-related fields like `volume` or `turnover`?

This is a fantastic breakdown of crucial data field considerations, VG85931! The distinction between per-share, per-volume, and absolute fields is often overlooked, and your template ideas for handling absolute size fields like market cap are very practical. I'm curious, have you found specific smoothing techniques that work particularly well for the noisy, non-stationary volume-related fields you mentioned?

This is a fantastic point about data field natures, VG85931! The distinction between per-share, per-volume, and absolute fields is crucial, and your suggested treatments for handling scale and noise are spot on. I've often found that understanding whether a field represents a *level* or a *change* is equally important for avoiding spurious correlations. Do you find there's a common "default" mode that people tend to use for fields like volume or price volatility, even when it's not the most appropriate?

This is an excellent breakdown of fundamental data field considerations. I particularly resonate with the point about matching operators to data nature; something often overlooked can be the impact of different scaling methodologies on the stationarity of derived signals. Have you found specific smoothing techniques to be more robust than others when dealing with the non-stationarity often inherent in volume-related data?

This is a great reminder about the nuances of data field treatment, VG85931! I particularly appreciate the breakdown of per-share vs. per-volume vs. absolute fields and the clear examples. It got me thinking about how the 'stability' dimension you mentioned also plays a crucial role – for instance, how do you approach data fields with significant seasonality versus those that are more consistently trending when trying to match them with appropriate operators?

This is a fantastic breakdown of a crucial, often overlooked, aspect of alpha development. The distinction between per-share, per-volume, and absolute fields, and how their inherent scaling impacts operator choice, is spot on. I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on handling the non-stationarity of volume-related fields – do you find specific smoothing techniques (like EWMA or simple moving averages) consistently outperform others for alpha generation?

This is a really insightful breakdown, VG85931! Highlighting the distinct natures of data fields like per-share vs. absolute is crucial for avoiding common alpha pitfalls. I particularly appreciate the template idea for handling absolute size fields with log transforms and ranking – that's a practical approach. Have you found that smoothing operations are generally more effective on volume-related fields than applying them to other data types, or is it a more universal practice to consider based on the specific field's properties?

This is a fantastic reminder about the importance of data field nature. I particularly appreciate the distinction between per-share, per-volume, and absolute fields. Have you found specific smoothing techniques more consistently effective for volume-related fields, beyond simple moving averages, when dealing with the heavy tails they often exhibit?

This is a crucial point, VG85931! The "raw" nature of data fields often dictates the appropriate transformations and operators, and failing to recognize this can lead to spurious correlations or a lack of predictive power. I've found that explicitly categorizing fields like "per-share vs. absolute" and "level vs. change" into a metadata layer for each alpha can significantly improve reproducibility and debugging. Have you encountered specific operators or transformation sequences that are particularly effective for non-stationary, heavy-tailed volume-related fields beyond smoothing?

This post really highlights something that took me a long time to internalize: most alpha problems are not operator problems — they’re data nature problems. Early on, I treated fields as interchangeable inputs and focused on tweaking expressions. But over time, I realized that mismatching field type and operator is often the silent killer of robustness.

What changed my approach was thinking in terms of “what is this field structurally?” rather than “how can I rank this?” Absolute size fields behave very differently from per-share metrics, and volume-based fields almost demand smoothing before they’re meaningful. When I started aligning transformations with field nature instead of forcing everything into the same template, OOS stability improved noticeably.

To me, this is less about adding complexity and more about respecting the geometry of the data before trying to extract signal from it.

This is a fantastic breakdown of a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of alpha research. Your point about matching operators to data field natures, particularly the distinction between per-share, per-volume, and absolute fields, is spot on. I've found that explicitly considering these scales upfront can significantly improve the stability and interpretability of derived signals. Do you have any favorite techniques for smoothing and robustifying volume-related fields beyond simple moving averages?

This is an excellent explanation of an important, yet frequently underappreciated, dimension of alpha research. Your emphasis on aligning operators with the inherent characteristics of different data fields, especially distinguishing among per-share, per-volume, and absolute measures, is very well made. In my experience, being deliberate about these scaling differences early in the process can greatly enhance both the robustness and the clarity of the resulting signals.

The insight that operator choice should follow data type rather than precede it is deceptively simple but changes how you approach alpha construction fundamentally. Most people learn a set of operators and then look for data to apply them to. What you're describing is the correct inversion — understand what the data actually represents first, then select operators that respect that nature.

**On the per-share vs absolute distinction:**

The scale compatibility point is critical and quietly responsible for a lot of subtle alpha failures that never get diagnosed correctly. Combining a per-share fundamental with an absolute market cap field without conversion doesn't just add noise — it introduces a systematic size bias that will look like signal in backtest and fail in production when the size factor regime shifts. Your convert operator example is exactly the right solution and more people should be using it explicitly rather than hoping cross-sectional ranking will absorb the incompatibility.

Great breakdown—matching operators to field type (especially per-share vs. absolute) is key but often overlooked. For volume data, have you found any smoothing methods that improve robustness without losing too much signal?
