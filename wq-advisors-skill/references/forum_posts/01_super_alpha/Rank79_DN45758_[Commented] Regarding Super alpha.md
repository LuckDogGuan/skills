In the selection expression, you select alpha with stricter constraints, while in the combo expression, you use operators like ts_sum, ts_scale, combo_a (it is recommended to use algo1 and algo2 to maintain good performance and also significantly reduce corr). Additionally, you can neutralize or lower the universe from TOP3000 to ILLIQUID_MINVOL1M, which also helps reduce corr and maintain performance.

Hi,

In superalphas selection expression is the important, since the underlined alphas decides the self and production correlations.

Here is a detailed post how you can use them to reduce your correlations.
 [https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/27626167187607-How-to-control-Alpha-selection-in-Super-Alpha](https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/27626167187607-How-to-control-Alpha-selection-in-Super-Alpha)  

some examples are below.

**SuperAlpha Selection Expression 1:**

(fraction(log(turnover * 100) * 577) * (operator_count > 10) * (datafield_count < 10) * (turnover > 0.14) * (turnover < 0.16) * (universe == "TOP3000") * ( os_start_date > "2020-01-01" )*( os_start_date < "2021-01-01" ))

**SuperAlpha Selection Expression 2:**

(fraction(log(turnover * 100) * 577) * (operator_count > 10) * (datafield_count < 10) * (turnover > 0.14) * (turnover < 0.16) * (universe == "TOP3000") * ( os_start_date > "2021-01-01" )*( os_start_date < "2022-01-01" ))

**SuperAlpha Selection Expression 3:**

(fraction(log(turnover * 100) * 577) * (operator_count > 10) * (datafield_count < 10) * (turnover > 0.14) * (turnover < 0.16) * (universe == "TOP3000") * ( os_start_date > "2022-01-01" )*( os_start_date < "2023-01-01" ))

In Super Alphas, both prod correlation and self correlation are influenced by the combo expression and the selection expression. The combo expression defines how individual signals are mathematically combined—using different operators like  `rank` ,  `zscore` , or  `decay_linear`  can significantly alter the structure and behavior of the resulting alpha. Similarly, the selection expression determines which subset of assets or signals are included in the strategy. When either of these expressions is changed, especially the combo expression, it can lead to a noticeable shift in correlation levels. For example, replacing one operator with another may reduce overlap with other alphas, thereby lowering prod correlation, while also affecting the consistency of the signal over time, impacting self correlation. This dynamic is particularly important when optimizing for uniqueness and performance in alpha design.

I’ll try experimenting with time-sliced selection and varying combo operators as suggested. If anyone has tips on how to check  *before hand*  whether two SuperAlphas might be too correlated, that would be super helpful too.

To reduce  **self-correlation**  and  **product correlation**  when developing a  **Super Alpha** , it is essential to carefully design the  **Super Alpha selection expression** , which dictates the composition of underlying alphas. High correlation between alphas can degrade the overall performance and diversification benefits of the Super Alpha. As explained in the World Quant Brain community post, one effective method is to  **segment alphas by different criteria**  such as  **time ranges** ,  **turnover** , and  **complexity metrics** .

For example, consider the three Super Alpha selection expressions shown:

- Each expression selects alphas within distinct  **OS (out-of-sample) start date ranges** , avoiding overlap.
- They also restrict  **turnover**  to a narrow band (0.14 to 0.16) and ensure  **operator count**  is greater than 10 while  **data field count**  is less than 10, controlling complexity and overfitting.
- By keeping  **universe**  constant and altering  **time windows** , we promote diversification while minimizing shared performance factors.

This approach ensures alphas used in one Super Alpha do not overlap significantly with those in another, thereby reducing self- and product-correlation. Strategic alpha filtering and diversified selection criteria are key to building robust, uncorrelated Super Alphas.

To reduce self-correlation and product correlation in Super Alpha development, you can:

- Apply stricter constraints when selecting input alphas.
- Use decorrelating operators like  `ts_sum` ,  `ts_scale` , or  `combo_a`  in the combo expression.
- Prefer algorithms like  `algo1`  and  `algo2`  to maintain performance while minimizing correlation.
- Consider neutralizing your signal or using narrower universes (e.g., from  `TOP3000`  to  `ILLIQUID_MINVOL1M` ) to help reduce correlation further.

These steps help ensure that your combined alpha is more diversified and robust.

Reducing self-correlation and product correlation in Super Alpha really comes down to carefully crafting both the selection and combo expressions. Using varied operators like ts_sum or ts_scale and limiting data fields helps diversify signals. Also, adjusting the universe—such as focusing on less correlated subsets like ILLIQUID_MINVOL1M instead of TOP3000—can make a big difference. Testing different time slices and operator combinations is key. It’d be great to have more tools to pre-check correlation before fully committing to a Super Alpha design.

In Super Alphas, both  **product correlation**  and  **self correlation**  are heavily influenced by the  **selection expression**  and the  **combo expression** . The selection expression acts as a filter, applying stricter constraints to ensure that only the most relevant alphas or signals are used in the final combination. Meanwhile, the combo expression defines how these signals are mathematically aggregated—using operators like  `ts_sum` ,  `ts_scale` , or  `combo_a` . To ensure strong performance while keeping correlations low, it's often recommended to use structured combo strategies such as  `algo1`  and  `algo2` .

Adjustments to universe definitions, such as narrowing from  `TOP3000`  to  `ILLIQUID_MINVOL1M` , can also significantly reduce correlation and maintain signal integrity. Every change in the combo or selection expression can influence the alpha’s uniqueness and stability. For example, replacing  `rank`  with  `zscore` , or modifying decay functions, may reduce overlap with other alphas and lower product correlation, while also impacting signal persistence and self correlation.

When optimizing Super Alphas, how do you decide between improving uniqueness (low prod corr) and maintaining signal consistency (low self corr)?

Thank you all for this incredibly insightful discussion. As someone still getting used to the intricacies of Super Alpha construction, I found every response here valuable—especially the specific guidance on how the selection and combo expressions impact both self- and product-level correlations. The breakdowns of using time segmentation, turnover constraints, and different operator types have given me practical ideas I can try right away. Special thanks to PP87148 for linking to the detailed community post and providing multiple selection expression templates—that was a game changer for me. It's posts like these that make the WorldQuant community such a helpful and collaborative space. I genuinely appreciate the time and knowledge shared here!

The key to lowering product correlation and self-correlation in Super Alpha is to carefully create the combo and selection expressions.

To reduce self- and product-correlation in Super Alphas, carefully design selection expressions to segment underlying alphas by criteria like OS start dates, turnover, and complexity. For example, selecting alphas within distinct time ranges, turnover bands (0.14–0.16), and operator/data field limits promotes diversification. Keeping the universe constant but varying time windows avoids overlap, minimizing shared performance drivers and ensuring more robust, uncorrelated Super Alpha compositions.
