## 帖子正文

- Reduced Transaction Costs
  Trading incurs real costs (commissions, bid-ask spreads, market impact, slippage). High turnover alphas generate more trades → higher costs eat into profits. Low turnover alphas keep more of the gross alpha as net profit.
  → WorldQuant and quant literature emphasize that "good alphas have low turnover" precisely because this directly boosts profit per $ traded (a key metric) and overall margin (profit relative to trading volume).
- Higher Capacity and Scalability
  Low-turnover signals are easier to scale to larger capital without moving the market or exhausting liquidity. High-turnover alphas often hit capacity limits quickly (especially in less liquid stocks or emerging markets).
  → Low turnover allows allocating more capital while maintaining performance, which is critical for WorldQuant's "Alpha Factory" approach of combining many alphas.
- Better Real-World Tradability and Leverage
  Alphas with excessive turnover can lose most of their edge after accounting for costs. Low turnover ones often preserve returns better when you simulate lower rebalancing frequency or apply trading constraints.
  → In WorldQuant simulations, reducing turnover (e.g., via decay, truncation, keep/tradewhen operators, or combining signals) often improves or maintains Sharpe while making the alpha more robust.
- Improved Portfolio-Level Metrics in WorldQuant BRAIN
  The platform scores alphas using a secret formula that heavily rewards low turnover. A key composite is Fitness, roughly:
  Fitness ≈ √(|Returns| / max(turnover, 0.125)) × Sharpe
  → This explicitly penalizes high turnover (even if Sharpe and returns look good) and boosts alphas that deliver stable performance with less trading.
  → Good alphas often aim for turnover <70% (many successful examples are 15–45%), alongside high Sharpe, low drawdown, and low correlation to others.
- Lower Alpha Decay Risk and Better Longevity
  High-turnover alphas (often short-term price/volume based) can decay faster as markets become more efficient or crowded. Lower-turnover ones (e.g., incorporating fundamentals, slower signals, or stable data like volume/log(volume)) tend to be more persistent and less arbitraged away.
- Easier Diversification and Combination
  When combining multiple alphas into a portfolio, low-turnover ones reduce overall portfolio turnover (via internal crossing of trades). This lowers net costs and improves efficiency.

Good points, we find the low turnover alphas are pretty helpful for the SA combination.

### 评论 #96 (作者: KP26017, 时间: 3个月前)

### Transaction cost model (core foundation)

In microstructure theory, total trading cost ≈

- commissions
- bid–ask spread
- market impact (∝ traded volume)
- slippage

Turnover acts as a  **linear multiplier**  on these costs:

> Net Return ≈ Gross Alpha − (Cost × Turnover)

So your statement is correct, but the key refinement is:

- It’s not just “low turnover is good”

### 评论 #97 (作者: HT71201, 时间: 3个月前)

Great points. Lower turnover improves net alpha by cutting costs, increasing capacity, and making strategies more scalable. It also enhances Fitness, reduces decay risk, and enables better diversification through internal crossing. In practice, more stable, low-turnover signals tend to deliver more consistent and tradable performance.
