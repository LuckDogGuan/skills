Hi Consultants! 👋

In the earlier discussion on  [hill-climbing algorithms]([Commented] [Alpha Machine] How do you optimize parameters within Alpha templateAlpha Template_27266129583255.md)  and their  [characteristics]([Commented] [Alpha Machine] Characteristics of Hill-Climbing OptimizationAlpha Template_27592505777047.md) , you may now be familiar with the overall idea. However, even when changing the original hill-climbing approach with random restarts, there's still room for improvement because each restart does not utilize previous information. Today, we’re wrapping up this mini-series by exploring several modifications that can enhance the algorithm. 🚀

### Basic Structure of Plain Random Hill-Climbing

1. **Initialization** : Start with an initial choice of parameters.
2. **Evaluation** : Simulate the expression and get its fitness.
3. **Selection** : Identify neighboring combinations by randomly choosing a different parameter from a randomly picked option.
4. **Comparison** : Re-simulate the updated expression and get its fitness.
5. **Update** : If a neighboring expression shows improved fitness, update the current choice to this new parameter set.
6. **Iteration** : Repeat the evaluation, selection, comparison, and update steps until no further improvements occur after  *n*  iterations.
7. **Restart** : Repeat the above steps  *m*  times. This is the restart mechanism.

### Smart Restart 🔄

The first modification to consider is ensuring that with every restart in step seven, the algorithm explores new areas it hasn't encountered before. To achieve this, you can implement a parameter counter that increments each time an option is selected and simulated in steps three and four. When restarting in step seven, instead of randomly drawing options from the available set, use the inverse of the counter as the probability of selection. This modification ensures that each restart selects parameters that haven't been explored in earlier trials. 🧠

Some of you might be wondering, "Why stop at just creating a counter? Why not design a smarter approach that incorporates performance information into future probabilities?" The implementation of this is left as a challenge for you —feel free to discuss your ideas below! 💡

### The Straight Path May Not Be the Best Path 🌄

As some of you have pointed out, the greedy nature of the random hill-climbing algorithm causes it to focus too much on immediate improvements, potentially overlooking a more optimal, curved path. Some have suggested using simulated annealing as a replacement, as it tolerates setbacks during exploration, which can help reach the global optimum. To enable the random hill-climbing algorithm to achieve similar results, you can introduce some white noise into step four. This adds randomness to the selection of the "best" neighbors.

Sometimes, the "best" neighbors might have sub-optimal fitness immediately but have the potential for better solutions in future steps! You can also design the noise to be dynamic, introducing more white noise in the early stages and gradually reducing it later on — similar to the decaying temperature in simulated annealing. ❄️🔥

this idea is just like gradient decent in the machine learning .

how to find the global minimum rather then local minimum solution

SGD adagrad  adam may be one of the optimization can try 😀

Yap, feel free to share how you may tackle this in SGD.
One interesting difficulty will be how to you encode the discrete variable, for example if you have ts_zscore, ts_rank and ts_delta as different discrete choices.

Hi, I would like to ask when we know that alpha has reached its peak of optimality, and should stop before overfitting starts to happen.

Thank you for sharing such an insightful discussion on hill-climbing algorithms and their modifications! The idea of Smart Restarts to explore unvisited parameter spaces and the concept of adding white noise to overcome local optima are excellent enhancements. Your explanation bridges the gap between theory and practical implementation, encouraging exploration of more sophisticated strategies like simulated annealing. The dynamic noise approach adds a creative layer, making the algorithm adaptable over iterations. These innovative tweaks undoubtedly open doors for more efficient optimization in complex problem spaces. Great work on presenting such valuable concepts so clearly and engagingly! 🚀💡

Hey YW42946! That's really insightful. For the smart restart part, using a parameter counter is indeed clever as it makes the algorithm explore new areas. And about introducing white noise in step four to mimic simulated annealing, that's a great idea too. It helps avoid getting stuck in local optima by adding randomness. Maybe we could also consider combining both mods for even better results. Looking forward to more discussions on this! 👍

Thank you for your article.

I'm happy the methods were useful to you. It is true that the hill-climbing algorithm may become considerably more flexible to a variety of intricate optimisation challenges by including strategies like dynamic noise modulation and better restarts. In real-world applications, where the search space might be large and challenging, these techniques aid the algorithm in avoiding local optima and more thoroughly exploring the solution space.

Hi TT55495! There are many ways to avoid overfitting.

One could be to limit your number of simulations, as you've suggested. The limit could depend on the data you're working with. The lower the number of data points, the lower the number of simulations.

Another could be to also limit the range of the parameters you're working with, instead of going through 1,2,3,4,5,...,252 days, only use 5,21,63,126,252 days.

Great discussion on hill-climbing algorithms and ways to enhance them! I really appreciate the introduction of smart restart and the potential to make each restart more exploratory by using the parameter counter and adjusting the selection probabilities. This ensures that previous searches don’t restrict the algorithm's exploration, which is a valuable step towards improving optimization performance.

When applying improvements to random hill-climbing in Alpha research, we can optimize trading strategies by combining smart restart and noise. For example, when optimizing parameters such as stop-loss ratios or portfolio weights, smart restart ensures that the algorithm explores new, unexplored regions, preventing over-optimization at already tested points

Great insights!  Smart restarts and white noise adjustments are excellent ways to  **escape local optima**  and  **improve exploration** .

Some ideas for enhancement:

- **Adaptive restarts** : Favor restarts near previously successful regions.
- **Momentum-based updates** : Track past improvements to guide future steps.

To improve random hill-climbing in Alpha optimization:

1. **Smart Restart**  – Use a parameter counter to bias restarts toward unexplored regions.
2. **White Noise in Selection**  – Introduce controlled randomness to escape local optima, similar to simulated annealing.
3. **Hybrid Approaches**  – Implement adaptive restarts near successful regions and momentum-based updates to guide steps.
4. **Overfitting Prevention**  – Limit simulations and constrain parameter search space.

@LY88401 @YW42946
Great point! To apply SGD-like methods to discrete choices like  `ts_zscore`  or  `ts_rank` , one idea is to treat them like categories and assign probabilities. Then, you can slowly adjust these probabilities based on which choices work better — kind of like teaching the model which ones to trust more over time.

To improve random hill-climbing in alpha creation, start with diverse, simple alphas to cover broad formula spaces. Use multiple random restarts and track performance across different datasets (train, validation, and test). Regularize aggressively to avoid overfitting. Mutate formulas intelligently by adding meaningful operators and combining strong subformulas. Dynamically adjust search intensity based on Sharpe improvements. Integrate cross-sectional and time-series features. Prioritize stability and turnover control during optimization. Always validate on out-of-sample data before finalizing promising candidates.
