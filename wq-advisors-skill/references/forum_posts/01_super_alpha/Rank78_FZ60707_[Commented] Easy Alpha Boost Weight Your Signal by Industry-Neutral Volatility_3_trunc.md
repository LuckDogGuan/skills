Just sharing a quick trick for the International Quant Championship that worked nicely for me in Stage 1 tests without changing the core logic of my alpha.

Whatever your main signal is (momentum, value, sentiment), try multiplying it by the inverse of volatility, but group-neutralized by industry.

You’re not changing  *what*  you’re ranking — just giving more weight to stable stocks within each industry.

Why this is useful:

- Volatility fields are available in every region and dataset
- Group neutralization keeps you diversified
- Can improve Sharpe without killing your correlation

It’s a low-effort tweak — just add the volatility adjustment and re-run your backtest. I saw a consistent Sharpe increase across both USA and EUR universes.

Anyone else try layering in simple volatility or liquidity filters like this? Curious to hear what variations worked best for you.

Nice trick! I've tried something similar using  `ts_rank(volatility, 10)`  instead of raw inverse volatility—it helps reduce extreme weighting when volatility is very low. Also, combining industry-neutral volatility with a liquidity filter (e.g., turnover) further improved Sharpe in my tests. Thanks for sharing!
