I select the alphas with a correlation to the product that is less than 0.6. Then I put them into an alpha list and randomly choose 15-20 alphas each time. This way, the likelihood of creating a super alpha with good performance is higher.

i often try like this :

- **Create Diverse, Low-Correlation Alphas** : Focus on regular alphas with low correlation (e.g., <0.6) to increase the likelihood of selection and strong performance. Diversify across regions and datasets for better results.
- **Prioritize Strong OS Performance** : Focus on alphas with clear, well-conceived designs and strong out-of-sample (OS) performance, as they are more likely to become key components of Mega Super Alphas.

Some ways:

- Create tags to select best alphas

- Use self_correlation or/and prod_correlation selection operatosr to find alphas with low correlation

- consider using selection features like Author Sharpe, Author Fitness - this can help you find alphas that have high sharpe; however they could be overfitted, or have high correlation

### 评论 #12 (作者: XM75236, 时间: 1年前)

I’ve found that  **diversifying across regions and datasets**  is essential. This approach broadens the scope of the alphas and reduces the impact of regional biases or dataset-specific anomalies. Combining alphas from different regions and datasets can lead to a more balanced and high-performing superalpha.

In summary, selecting the best alphas for a superalpha involves a combination of low correlation, strong out-of-sample performance, random selection, dynamic weighting, and diversification. By integrating these strategies, I’ve been able to create more robust and high-performing superalphas.

This post offers some excellent insights into building effective  **Selection Expressions**  for Super Alphas. The emphasis on  **self_correlation**  is spot on—keeping it low is crucial for improving Sharpe when merging alphas, though it’s true that self-corr can increase over time.

The focus on  **operator_count**  and  **dataset_count**  for simplicity and robustness is another valuable point, especially when leveraging alphas from others.  **Data categories**  and  **tags**  also provide structure, with tags being especially useful for single-alpha-based Super Alphas.

Accessing a pool of others' alphas is indeed a powerful yet complex tool, requiring careful curation. Your insights are practical and thought-provoking—great for anyone looking to refine their Super Alpha strategy!

- ### 1. Self-Correlation
  You're absolutely right that  **self-correlation**  is critical when working with a large number of alphas. Low self-correlation ensures that your combined alpha portfolio benefits from diversification, which in turn boosts the Sharpe ratio.
  However, as you mentioned, self-correlation can increase over time due to factor convergence or market dynamics, so continuously monitoring and managing it is key. Techniques like dynamic weighting or incorporating orthogonalization methods might help in maintaining low self-correlation.
  ### 2. Operator_Count and Dataset_Count
  Simplicity in alpha design indeed contributes to robustness. An alpha with fewer operators and datasets is less likely to overfit and generally more stable across varying market regimes. When combining alphas from others,  **operator_count and dataset_count**  can serve as a heuristic for identifying robust signals.
  However, a trade-off exists: overly simplistic alphas might miss complex patterns. To strike a balance, it can be helpful to mix simple and moderately complex alphas in a super alpha framework.
  ### 3. Data Categories
  Building alphas around specific  **data categories**  (e.g., fundamentals, sentiment, technicals) is a smart way to ensure factor alignment and interpretability.
  When using alphas from others, you’re right—mislabeling or lack of clear tagging can pose challenges. Standardizing tagging conventions or manually verifying alpha characteristics might help.
  ### 4. Alpha Tags
  Using tags effectively is essential, especially when building  **super alphas** . Tags enable systematic grouping of alphas, ensuring that you're combining signals with complementary characteristics.
  When relying solely on your alphas, robust tagging helps maintain consistency and focus. If you're pulling alphas from a broader pool, ensuring diversity in tags can reduce overlap and enhance performance.
  ### 5. Access to the Pool of Alphas
  The idea of accessing alphas from a larger pool is both exciting and complex. Some challenges include:
  - **Trustworthiness of external alphas** : Evaluating the reliability and potential overfitting of external alphas is critical. Metrics like backtest consistency, rolling Sharpe ratios, and real-world performance are helpful.
  - **Diversity management** : With a larger pool, ensuring that you avoid excessive overlap (both within and across alphas) becomes harder. Tools like clustering can help identify similar alphas and eliminate redundancies.
  - **Performance attribution** : Understanding which external alphas contribute the most to your portfolio's success (or failure) is vital for iterative refinement.

1️⃣  **Correlation Clustering** : Start by clustering Alphas based on their correlation matrices. This ensures you're selecting Alphas that are sufficiently diverse, reducing redundancy in your Superalpha.

2️⃣  **Fitness Thresholds** : Use a defined fitness threshold as a filter. Prioritize Alphas with consistently high fitness scores over various timeframes to ensure robustness.

3️⃣  **Sharpe Ratio Focus** : Evaluate the Sharpe ratio or similar risk-adjusted performance metrics for Alphas to find those with better return-to-risk balance.

4️⃣  **Weight Optimization** : Once you’ve shortlisted, use optimization techniques like convex optimization to assign weights, prioritizing Alphas with low correlation and high individual performance.

5️⃣  **Validation with Forward Testing** : Test the combined Superalpha on out-of-sample data to validate that the chosen Alphas contribute positively and maintain the desired performance metrics.

### 评论 #18 (作者: PL15523, 时间: 1年前)

First, establish the fitness function or performance metric you're using to evaluate the quality of your alpha. This could be based on metrics such as returns, Sharpe ratio, or any other performance measure that aligns with your investment goals.

### 评论 #19 (作者: MA97359, 时间: 1年前)

First, establish a hierarchy based on fitness by determining the level of fitness you require for the alphas you want to select. Next, filter these alphas based on your correlation criteria. Alternatively, you can create a correlation-based hierarchy and select or filter alphas by choosing the desired number with lower correlations

This post provides valuable insights into crafting effective Selection Expressions for Super Alphas. The emphasis on keeping self_correlation low is crucial for enhancing Sharpe when combining alphas, though it naturally tends to rise over time.

Highlighting operator_count and dataset_count for simplicity and robustness is particularly useful, especially when integrating external alphas. Organizing with data categories and tags adds further structure, with tags being especially beneficial for single-alpha-based Super Alphas.

Leveraging others' alphas is a powerful yet intricate process that demands careful selection. Your practical and insightful approach makes this a great resource for refining Super Alpha strategies!

Hi,

Please refer to the below selection expression:

(

(self_correlation < 0.6) &&

(turnover < 0.18) &&

(in(datacategories, "model"))

) * NOT(OWN)

**Explanation:**

1. **NOT(OWN)** :
   This ensures that the alpha is selected from the pool excluding your own submissions, as per the selection expression.
2. **Selection Criteria** :
   The expression will filter alphas from the  **"Model"**  data category where:

This ensures a curated selection of alphas with lower turnover and minimal self-correlation from the "Model" category, while excluding your own pool for diverse signals.

Effective alpha selection involves reducing correlation, optimizing weightings, and exploring clustering techniques. Diversifying across regions and datasets minimizes biases and enhances performance. A well-balanced superalpha integrates dynamic weighting, random selection, and strong out-of-sample results, creating a more resilient and high-performing strategy.

### 评论 #23 (作者: WX16829, 时间: 1年前)

I suggest to focus on Low Correlation Alphas.
Low correlation between Alphas is crucial for reducing portfolio volatility and enhancing diversification benefits. Here are some approaches:
Sector Neutralization: Ensure that your Alphas are sector-neutralized to minimize sector-specific risks and correlations. For example, using subindustry or sector neutralization can help in selecting signals that are less correlated.
Diverse Data Sources: Incorporate Alphas derived from different data sources, such as fundamental data (e.g., earnings, revenue), technical data (e.g., price momentum, volatility), and alternative data (e.g., news sentiment, social media buzz). This diversity can help reduce correlation

### 评论 #24 (作者: AK52014, 时间: 1年前)

- **Develop Diverse, Low-Correlation Alphas**  – Prioritize regular alphas with low correlation (e.g., <0.6) to enhance selection chances and overall performance. Diversifying across regions and datasets further improves effectiveness.
- **Emphasize Strong OS Performance**  – Focus on well-structured alphas with solid out-of-sample (OS) performance, as they are more likely to become integral parts of Mega Super Alphas.

### 评论 #25 (作者: SY65468, 时间: 1年前)

To develop a strong super alpha, focus on  **low-correlation signals**  (<0.6) to improve diversification and minimize risk. Choose alphas with  **reliable out-of-sample performance**  and leverage  **filters like self_correlation and prod_correlation**  to identify unique ones. While  **Author Sharpe and Author Fitness**  can be helpful, prioritizing  **uncorrelated alphas**  reduces the risk of overfitting. Maintain  **sector neutrality**  to prevent industry bias and combine  **fundamental, technical, and alternative data**  for a well-rounded approach. Selecting 20 - 25 **diverse alphas**  at random increases the probability of constructing a stable, high-performing strategy.

### 评论 #26 (作者: HV77283, 时间: 1年前)

Low self-correlation boosts diversification and the Sharpe ratio but requires monitoring via techniques like dynamic weighting. Simple alphas reduce overfitting but may miss patterns, so a balanced mix enhances stability. Categorizing alphas by data type improves interpretability, while standardizing tags prevents mislabeling.

### 评论 #27 (作者: NN89351, 时间: 1年前)

That’s a solid way to diversify alpha combinations while keeping correlation in check. Randomly selecting subsets can sometimes reveal unexpected synergies between alphas. Have you tried adjusting weightings dynamically or using clustering methods to fine-tune your selections? Exploring these tweaks might help uncover even stronger combinations.

---

### 评论 #28 (作者: LH71010, 时间: 1年前)

I think you should select your low self correlation, which can boost your fitness and sharpe after combination. You can choose "Prod_Corr" fuction in your selection window to process this.

### 评论 #29 (作者: 顾问 HD25387 (Rank 65), 时间: 1年前)

To select the best alphas for  **SuperAlpha** , follow these key steps:

1. **Low Correlation Selection** : Choose alphas with a correlation below  **0.6**  to minimize redundancy and enhance diversification.
2. **High Fitness Score** : Prioritize alphas with strong  **OS (out-of-sample) performance** , ensuring robustness in real-world conditions.
3. **Diverse Start Dates** : Pick alphas with a  **start date of around two years ago**  to ensure a well-balanced OS period.
4. **Randomized Alpha Pooling** : Create a list of qualified alphas and randomly pick  **15-20**  for testing, improving the chance of forming a strong SuperAlpha.
5. **Iterative Testing** : Simulate different alpha combinations to refine selection and maximize performance.

By combining these approaches, you increase the probability of building a  **SuperAlpha**  that is both stable and high-performing.

In addition, you can try

> (dataset_count==1 && datafield_count<=a && operator_count<=b)/turnover

to prevent overfitted alphas being selected.

### 评论 #31 (作者: EM11875, 时间: 1年前)

Nice, I have really enjoyed the discussion above here.

Diversification of alphas with low correlation, good performing alphas signals. Alternatively, recent single dataset alphas and alphas with lower data field count and operator count have helped in creating a strong merged signal. This can help when choosing the alphas for your super alphas.

### 评论 #32 (作者: LR13671, 时间: 7个月前)

The key lies in identifying alphas that bring  *unique information content*  rather than overlapping signals. Using filters like  `self_correlation < 0.6`  or  `prod_correlation < 0.6`  helps eliminate redundancy, ensuring each alpha adds incremental predictive power. Equally important is emphasizing  **OS performance**  — a high in-sample Sharpe often signals overfitting, whereas consistent OS results demonstrate real robustness.
