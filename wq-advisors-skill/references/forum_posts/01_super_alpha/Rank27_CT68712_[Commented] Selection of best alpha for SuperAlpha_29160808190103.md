I also faced difficulties while working on SuperAlpha, especially when using Alphas created by other Consultants.
I hope to receive insights from experienced Consultants, particularly those who achieved top positions in the SAC competition.

You can try to select with prod cor and self cor selection to select alpha with low correlation and maybe the super alphas may have lower correlation. About higher fitness, it may depend on the selected alpha your combo.

Try to cover alphas across diverse datasets to produce robust super alphas. You can use operators like self_corr, prod_corr, turnover, long_count, short_count etc. to cover diverse alphas in your selection expression.

Check the Selection Experession in documentm you may find some idea there, but from my opinion, you can use your alpha idea to write exactly the super alpha.

In example : your alpha idea based on short position, you can write a super alpha like this : in("dataset","your_alpha_dataset")*(short_count > x )*...

x should be higher than half the universe. From this experession, you can merge a lot of alpha in the same dataset that might have the same kind of signal. 
Hope it help you.

You can use prod cor and self cor selection to choose alphas with low correlation, and the super alphas might have even lower correlation, while higher fitness depends on the specific alphas you select for your combination.

First, establish a hierarchy based on fitness by determining the level of fitness you require for the alphas you want to select. Next, filter these alphas based on your correlation criteria. Alternatively, you can create a correlation-based hierarchy and select or filter alphas by choosing the desired number with lower correlations

#### **Hi PT88153**

To select best alpha for the super alpha which has low correlation and high fitness you can try this expression

"turnover<0.20  &&  self_correlation>X  &&  self_correlation<Y"

'X' is the minimum correlation from where you start Like ; 0.25

you have to keep the value 'Y' from 'X' till you get 20 alpha Like ; 0.3

#### **So this expression will look like this**

turnover<0.20  &&  self_correlation>0.25  &&  self_correlation<0.3

you can increase or decrease the turnover as per your convenience.

#### thus, the value of self correlation has to be kept different for different super alpha

### 评论 #11 (作者: MB13430, 时间: 1年前)

Try creating a super alpha using the same dataset with a similar turnover. Avoid mixing low-turnover alphas with high-turnover alphas to maintain consistency.
For example

```
 turnover<0.20 && turnover>0.15 && in(dataset , "dataset_name")
```

To select the best alphas for a Superalpha with low correlation and high fitness, follow these steps:

1. **Rank by Fitness** : Sort alphas based on their fitness metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, IC, or other performance indicators).
2. **Evaluate Correlation** : Compute pairwise correlations between alphas and prioritize those with low correlation to existing components in the Superalpha.
3. **Diversity Filtering** : Ensure alphas span different factor categories (e.g., value, momentum, sentiment) for broader market coverage.
4. **Stress Test** : Include alphas resilient to drawdowns and market regime changes.
5. **Iterative Testing** : Add selected alphas incrementally and test their combined performance for synergy.

This ensures a balance of strong individual performance and low redundancy in the Superalpha.

Hi,

Please refer to the below selection expression:

```
(
    (self_correlation < 0.6) &&
    (turnover < 0.18) &&
    (in(datacategories, "model"))
) * NOT(OWN)

```

### Explanation:

1. **`NOT(OWN)`** :
   This ensures that the alpha is selected from the pool excluding your own submissions, as per the selection expression.
2. **Selection Criteria** :
   The expression will filter alphas from the  **"Model"**  data category where:
   - **Turnover**  is less than 18%.
   - **Self-correlation**  is less than 60%.

This ensures a curated selection of alphas with lower turnover and minimal self-correlation from the "Model" category, while excluding your own pool for diverse signals.

Try medium turnover alphas, balanced longShort count, prod_correlation and self_correlation higher than 0.55 and less than 0.6. Too low self-correlation or prod-correlation alphas usually have low fitness.

This suggestion focuses on leveraging your alpha idea to create a "super alpha" by combining multiple alphas within the same dataset. Key points include:

1. **Reference the Selection Expression** : Explore the document for relevant selection expressions to spark ideas.
2. **Building the Super Alpha** : Use your alpha idea and extend it with a formula like:
3. `in("dataset", "your_alpha_dataset") * (short_count > x) * ...
   `
   - **Short Position Example** : If your alpha is based on short positions, set  `x`  to a value greater than half the universe for stronger signals.
4. **Merge Similar Signals** : Combine multiple alphas with similar characteristics or signals within the dataset to create a more robust model.

This approach enhances alpha strength by integrating complementary signals while maintaining focus on your original strategy.

Hi SC87308

I appreciate you providing this strategy! To maximise my alpha selection, I will undoubtedly use this phrase and test out various values for X and Y. I may refine the technique to choose alphas with low correlation and good fitness by varying the turnover and self-correlation range, which will ultimately result in a more robust and diversified portfolio. I also value the freedom to modify the turnover in accordance with the unique traits of the alphas.

I'm optimistic that this approach will provide positive outcomes, and I'm excited to watch how the performance changes as I use it!

Hey PT88153, I totally get the struggle with selecting the best alpha for SuperAlpha, especially when it comes to minimizing correlation while maximizing fitness. One approach you might consider is analyzing the turnover and correlation metrics of your alphas meticulously. Utilizing criteria like self_correlation and prod_correlation can help ensure a more diverse selection of alphas that work well together. Don't hesitate to experiment with different value ranges in your selections. Much like when I played in the pros, strategy and adaptability are key—test, learn, and adjust as needed. Good luck, and I look forward to seeing how your SuperAlpha performs!
