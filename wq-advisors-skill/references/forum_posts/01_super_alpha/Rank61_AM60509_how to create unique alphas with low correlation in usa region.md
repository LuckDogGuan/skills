Since,USA is the most commonly used region and there are lot of alphas which  have been already submitted by everyone,I am finding difficult to submit alphas with lower correlation than 0.7.Most of the times correlation is coming in 80s and 90s.

Can someone please guide on how to proceed

Sector & Market Neutralization: Use vector_neut or regression_neut to neutralize exposure to broad market trends.

Pair Trading or Residual Alphas: Instead of predicting absolute price changes, model the relative performance of two stocks in the same sector.

Factor Neutralization: Identify major style factors (momentum, value, growth, etc.) and remove their impact using regression techniques.

Modify the signal’s turnover using ts_decay, ts_target_tvr_hump, or trade_when to make your Alpha behave differently from existing ones.

Experiment with different lookback periods (e.g., shorter-term trends vs. longer-term mean reversion).

Underutilized datasets present some of the best opportunities. For example, satellite imagery tracking oil inventory levels or credit card transaction data for consumer spending trends can generate macro-driven trading signals. However, incorporating these datasets requires robust preprocessing and feature engineering to prevent noise from diluting alpha effectiveness.

### 评论 #23 (作者: DS76192, 时间: 1年前)

Correlation often arises from exposure to common market factors such as momentum, value, or sector-wide trends. You can apply sector, factor, or market-neutralization techniques like  `vector_neut`  and  `regression_neut`  to remove these effects. Additionally, using pair trading or residual alphas can reduce market exposure by modeling relative performance rather than absolute price movements. For example, instead of predicting a single stock’s movement, structure your alpha around relative strength within a sector or industry group to eliminate broad market influences.

### 评论 #24 (作者: KK32415, 时间: 1年前)

To make your alpha distinct, consider neutralizing against major market factors using operators like vector_neut or regression_neut. This helps in eliminating exposure to broad market movements and ensure your alpha captures unique stock-specific signals rather than common systematic trends.

### Optimizing Alphas by Reducing Correlation and Enhancing Uniqueness

To achieve a correlation below 0.7 in the USA region, try these strategies:

1. **Advanced Neutralization**  – Use  **vector_neut(x, y)**  and  **vector_proj(x, y)**  to remove broad market influences and enhance alpha specificity. Applying  **regression_neut**  on industry factors helps eliminate sector-driven effects.
2. **Group-Based Signal Enhancement**  – Leverage  **group_cartesian_product(x, y)**  to combine distinct datasets, creating diverse signals. For instance, grouping price-based factors with ESG metrics improves resilience.
3. **Alternative Data Utilization**  – Tap into niche datasets like satellite imagery or transaction data, integrating them with  **ts_regression(y, x, d)**  for predictive modeling.
4. **Holding Period and Transformations**  – Adjust time horizons using  **ts_decay_exp_window(x, d, f)**  to reduce common signal overlap and enhance Sharpe ratios.

**Example:**  Replacing standard momentum with  **ts_kurtosis(price_change, 30)**  reduced correlation from 0.85 to 0.65, improving stability.

Applying these techniques optimizes data relationships, ensuring a stronger and more distinctive alpha strategy. Good luck! 🚀

Advanced techniques like vector_neut, vector_proj, regression_neut, and regression_proj are powerful tools for reducing correlation and improving Sharpe ratios by isolating unique signals. They work best on structured datasets (price-volume, fundamentals) and help neutralize common exposures like market or sector trends, enhancing alpha specificity.

Group Operators (group_coalesce, group_cartesian_product) create diversified signals by combining datasets across hierarchies—industries, regions, or ESG metrics—boosting model resilience and stability.

Tapping into underutilized datasets (satellite imagery, credit card transactions, specialized macro factors) offers novel alpha opportunities with distinct return profiles.

Enhance performance further by adjusting holding periods and applying transformations like ts_decay_exp_window or ts_kurtosis to reduce overlap and strengthen Sharpe ratios.

Example: Switching momentum to  `ts_kurtosis(price_change, 30)`  dropped correlation from 0.85 to 0.65, improving stability.

Have you experimented with blending these techniques to refine your alpha strategies?
