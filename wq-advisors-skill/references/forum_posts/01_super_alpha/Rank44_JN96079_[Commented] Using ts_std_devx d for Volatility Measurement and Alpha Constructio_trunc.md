When applying  `ts_std_dev` , which functions do you usually combine it with (e.g., delta, correlation, ts_rank) to turn volatility into a predictive trading signal?

That’s a great and practical question. Volatility measured by  `ts_std_dev`  is often most effective when combined with price change measures like  `delta()`  to detect abnormal fluctuations, with  `correlation()`  to assess risk-adjusted co-movement, or with  `ts_rank()`  to normalize volatility across assets. The key is not just measuring volatility but transforming it into relative signals that can indicate regime shifts or risk-adjusted opportunities.

I usually find ts_std_dev works well with delta to capture shifts in volatility, and with correlation to check whether volatility aligns with price or volume moves. ts_rank is also handy to normalize it across names so you can spot relative extremes. The best combo really depends on how you want volatility to translate into forward returns, so some experimentation is always needed.

Really interesting takes here. I’ve been experimenting with ts_std_dev together with delta too — feels like a simple but effective way to catch those sudden volatility shifts. Correlation adds a nice risk-adjusted angle, and ts_rank makes it easier to compare across assets without getting lost in scale differences. I’m still figuring out which combo translates best into forward returns, but this post gave me a couple of new ideas to test out. Thanks for sharing!

I think one underrated angle is how  **ts_std_dev**  interacts with trend vs. mean-reversion contexts.

- Pairing it with  **delta**  is powerful for spotting volatility breakouts, but if you also test  **signed_power(delta, p)**  on top, you can better emphasize extreme shocks without overreacting to noise.
- With  **correlation** , I’ve found it useful not only for co-movement but also for detecting when volatility is  *decoupled*  from price trends — sometimes that divergence itself is predictive.
- **ts_rank**  is indeed key for cross-sectional comparison, but I’ve also had success combining it with  **zscore()**  to keep the distribution more stable across regimes.

Curious if anyone here has tried feeding ts_std_dev-derived features into  **hump()**  or  **decay_linear()**  as a smoothing step before turning them into alphas? It might help avoid whipsaws when volatility spikes suddenly.

I appreciate you all. I am currently researching how useful  ***ts_std_dev***  can be in alpha creation and performance of signals through its implementation, and I have found your meaningful comments remarkably useful and will definitely help me achieve my research.

Thank you all!

Great topic! ts_std_dev(x, d) is one of those versatile building blocks that can take on very different roles depending on what you pair it with. For example, when combined with  **delta(close, d)** , it often acts as a volatility breakout detector, highlighting moments where price movement becomes disproportionately large relative to its recent history. With  **correlation(delta, ts_std_dev)** , you can test whether volatility clusters alongside directional moves — useful for filtering false breakouts from real momentum. Cross-sectionally, I find  **ts_rank(ts_std_dev, d)**  invaluable, since raw volatility scales differ massively across stocks and sectors; ranking levels the playing field and makes it easier to spot relative risk extremes. Another interesting extension is to divide returns by ts_std_dev (i.e., Sharpe-like normalization), then rank — that often surfaces more stable signals than pure momentum. For extra robustness, I sometimes smooth volatility features through  **decay_linear**  or  **ts_sma**  before integrating them into an alpha, which helps avoid whipsaws when volatility spikes abruptly.

Thanks so much for opening this discussion and to everyone who has contributed—it’s been extremely valuable. I’ve always used ts_std_dev mostly in its raw form, but this thread has shown me a variety of creative combinations, like pairing it with delta to catch regime shifts, or using ts_rank for cross-sectional comparability. I especially appreciate the suggestions about smoothing volatility inputs before plugging them into alphas—that’s something I hadn’t considered but now see the value in. It’s really encouraging to see such practical, detailed insights being shared openly in the community. Posts like this help connect the dots between theory and implementation, and I’ll definitely be testing out some of these approaches in my own research. Thank you all!

You combine  `ts_std_dev`  with other functions to create predictive signals by adding  **directional**  or  **comparative context**  to volatility.

- **`ts_std_dev`  and  `delta`** : A sudden change in volatility can be a signal. Combining  `ts_std_dev`  with  `delta`  ( `delta(ts_std_dev, N)` ) helps to identify a sharp increase or decrease in volatility, which might indicate a potential breakout or a sudden shift in market sentiment.
- **`ts_std_dev`  and  `ts_rank`** : Using  `ts_rank`  on  `ts_std_dev`  ( `ts_rank(ts_std_dev, N)` ) is a powerful way to gauge if a stock's current volatility is historically high or low. For example, a high rank suggests the stock is unusually volatile, which could be a signal for a mean-reversion strategy, betting on volatility to decrease.
- **`ts_std_dev`  and  `correlation`** : This combination is useful in pair trading. When two assets that are typically highly correlated start to diverge and their individual  `ts_std_dev`  values increase, it can be a sign of a temporary breakdown in their relationship, presenting a trading opportunity to bet on their convergence.

Great topic! ts_std_dev(x, d) is versatile: paired with delta(close, d) it detects volatility breakouts; correlation checks clustering with directional moves; ts_rank normalizes cross-sectional scales; dividing returns by ts_std_dev surfaces stable signals; smoothing adds robustness.

关于ts_std_dev与其他函数的组合应用，这个话题确实值得探讨。在WorldQuant Brain平台上，我通常会结合delta和ts_rank来构建波动率相关的alpha因子。比如用delta(ts_std_dev(close, 20), 5)来捕捉波动率的变化趋势，或者用ts_rank(ts_std_dev(volume, 10), 60)来识别波动率的相对位置。不过大佬提到的correlation组合也很有意思，但实际回测中需要注意过拟合风险，毕竟波动率信号在不同市场环境下表现差异很大。最近在测试一个结合ts_std_dev和ts_decay_linear的因子，效果还在验证中。

I like  `ts_std_dev(volume, N)`  together with  `ts_corr(volume, returns)`  to explore volatility in liquidity. It’s helpful for finding volume-driven short-term momentum signals.
