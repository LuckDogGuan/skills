Alpha example for GLB Region Delay 1

vol_trend = ts_sum(mdl110_score, 60) / ts_mean(close, 120);signal = group_neutralize(rank(vol_trend), subindustry);

### **Components Explanation:**

1. **`vol_trend = ts_sum(mdl110_score, 60) / ts_mean(close, 120);`**
   - **`ts_sum(mdl110_score, 60)`** :
   - This calculates the sum of the  `mdl110_score`  (a predictive score or fundamental/quantitative measure) over the past 60 days.
   - It reflects the cumulative value of  `mdl110_score`  over a short-to-medium-term period.
   - **`ts_mean(close, 120)`** :
   - This computes the average of the closing prices over the past 120 days.
   - It provides a longer-term view of price behavior, smoothing out short-term fluctuations.
   - **Overall Ratio** :
   - Dividing the cumulative  `mdl110_score`  by the average closing price generates a trend indicator ( `vol_trend` ).
   - A high ratio indicates strong predictive signals relative to the underlying price over time.
2. **`signal = group_neutralize(rank(vol_trend), subindustry);`**
   - **`rank(vol_trend)`** :
   - Assigns a relative rank to  `vol_trend`  across all instruments in the universe, with values distributed between 0 and 1.
   - Higher-ranked instruments have stronger  `vol_trend`  compared to peers.
   - **`group_neutralize(…, subindustry)`** :
   - Neutralizes the signal within each subindustry group, ensuring that the alpha signal does not exhibit a bias toward specific subindustries.
   - This removes systematic differences across subindustries and focuses on the relative strength of instruments within each subindustry.

### **Purpose and Intuition:**

This alpha captures the relationship between a medium-term predictive score ( `mdl110_score` ) and the stock's longer-term price trend. By neutralizing the signal at the subindustry level, the alpha aims to identify stocks with exceptional predictive signals that stand out relative to their subindustry peers.

- **Use Case** :
  - This alpha is suitable for sector-neutral or subindustry-neutral portfolio construction, as it ensures diversification by avoiding concentrated exposure to specific subindustries.
- **Potential Signals** :
  - Stocks with high  `vol_trend`  may indicate stronger upward momentum or other favorable predictive attributes.
  - Neutralization within subindustries ensures broader sectoral trends do not skew these signals.

Since you’ve already tried decay and hump, it might be useful to fine-tune the parameters more. You could experiment with different decay rates or functional forms that might better align with your objectives. For example, exponential decay might be more effective than linear decay, depending on your strategy's nature.

The alpha example for GLB Region Delay 1 uses vol_trend as the core indicator, calculated by dividing the 60-day sum of mdl110_score by the 120-day average closing price. This captures predictive signal strength relative to price trends. Ranking the vol_trend assigns a comparative value, while group_neutralize ensures signals are unbiased within each subindustry by eliminating systematic differences. This approach identifies stocks with exceptional predictive attributes within their subindustry peers. The neutralization process supports sector-neutral portfolio construction, promoting diversification and reducing concentrated exposure. High vol_trend values may signal stronger momentum or favorable predictive trends. The design focuses on isolating meaningful signals while maintaining industry neutrality, making it effective for identifying standout stocks in a balanced, risk-managed portfolio strategy.

The components you're describing represent a systematic approach to generating a signal that incorporates both predictive scores (e.g.,  **mdl110_score** ) and price behavior over time, with an added layer of industry-neutralization for robustness. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

### **1. vol_trend:**

The  **vol_trend**  is essentially a ratio that compares the recent predictive score to the long-term price trend. This indicator combines the  **mdl110_score**  and  **close price** , offering a view of how well the  **mdl110_score**  (which could represent a fundamental or quantitative measure) relates to price movements over different timeframes.

- **ts_sum(mdl110_score, 60)** : This operator calculates the sum of the  **mdl110_score**  over the last 60 days. This provides an aggregate measure of the score over a relatively short-term period. The score could reflect fundamental or technical factors like earnings forecasts, price momentum, or other quantitative metrics that influence an asset's potential.
- **ts_mean(close, 120)** : This operator calculates the 120-day average of the  **close**  price, offering a smoothed, longer-term view of the price behavior. This longer window helps reduce noise in price data and highlights broader trends over the past several months. By averaging the closing price over 120 days, you smooth out short-term price fluctuations and get a sense of where the price is heading in the longer run.
- **vol_trend = ts_sum(mdl110_score, 60) / ts_mean(close, 120)** : The  **vol_trend**  ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of the  **mdl110_score**  over the last 60 days by the average closing price over the last 120 days. The purpose of this is to measure how predictive or strong the  **mdl110_score**  is in relation to the overall price trend. A higher  **vol_trend**  indicates that the score is more significant compared to the price trend, which may be indicative of a stronger investment signal.

### **signal:**

After calculating  **vol_trend** , you use a  **rank**  and  **neutralization**  approach to finalize the signal and remove biases.

- **rank(vol_trend)** : Ranking the  **vol_trend**  assigns a relative value to each instrument based on how strong its  **vol_trend**  is compared to others in the universe. The  **rank**  function scales the values between 0 and 1, so the highest-ranked instruments will have the strongest  **vol_trend** , meaning they have a high predictive score relative to the long-term price trend. The  **rank**  function essentially ranks instruments from most to least favorable based on their  **vol_trend**  ratio.
- **group_neutralize(…, subindustry)** : The  **group_neutralize**  function removes any systematic biases that might exist between different  **subindustries** . By neutralizing within each subindustry group, you ensure that the signal doesn’t favor one industry over another. This allows you to focus on the relative strength of the  **vol_trend**  signal within each subindustry, rather than having an unfair bias towards industries that naturally tend to perform better or worse due to external factors.

### **Summary:**

- **vol_trend**  helps you understand how well the  **mdl110_score**  (a predictive metric) compares to the longer-term price trend, giving you an indicator of relative strength.
- **signal**  ranks instruments based on  **vol_trend**  to identify which instruments show the most promise according to the combined predictive score and price behavior.
- **group_neutralize**  removes any subindustry bias, ensuring that the  **signal**  reflects relative strength without being skewed by industry effects.

### **Final Use Case:**

This setup is a great way to develop a model that predicts future price movements based on  **fundamental**  or  **quantitative**  scores (represented by  **mdl110_score** ) while also considering broader market trends and industry-specific influences. By neutralizing for subindustry, you avoid having your model be unduly influenced by sector-specific trends, helping to generate a more reliable and universal Alpha signal.

感覺這個Alpha模型（vol_trend = ts_sum(mdl110_score, 60) / ts_mean(close, 120)）結合了預測評分（mdl110_score）和價格數據（收盤價），試圖捕捉中期預測評分與股票長期價格趨勢之間的關係。透過對信號進行子行業中性化，能夠有效地去除系統性偏差，更加明確地識別出表現優異的股票。這種模型在構建 sector-neutral 或 subindustry-neutral 投資組合時尤其有用，因為它能夠保證投資的多元化，避免過度暴露於特定的子行業。未來可能可以嘗試對模型進行微調，如採用不同的衰減率，或者尝試其他類型的信號，如rank(signal)等，來不斷優化Alpha模型的表現。

AR models are time-series operators that predict future values by regressing the current value against past observations, capturing autocorrelation patterns.

---

### 评论 #14 (作者: AC63290, 时间: 1年前)

This is an interesting approach combining momentum and industry-relative signals. A few key observations:

- The use of mdl110_score over 60 days normalized by 120-day price average creates a robust volume-price relationship indicator
- The industry neutralization through group_neutralize is particularly valuable for reducing sector-specific risks
- Consider adding volatility adjustment to improve signal stability: you could normalize vol_trend by its rolling standard deviation
- For GLB region with Delay 1, you might want to account for timezone effects by adjusting the lookback windows
- Testing different window combinations (e.g., 45/90 or 90/180) could optimize the signal's predictive power

This alpha model combines predictive scores and price behavior over time to generate signals while neutralizing biases within subindustries. How do you determine the appropriate time windows (60 days vs. 120 days) when creating your own alpha strategies?

---

### 评论 #18 (作者: RB98150, 时间: 1年前)

This is a reasonable alpha with a focus on trends in  `mdl110_score`  relative to price. However, testing alternative normalizations and smoothing methods could enhance its robustness. Also, evaluating the signal’s turnover and decay characteristics will be key for implementation

### 评论 #19 (作者: RG93974, 时间: 1年前)

You could experiment with different decay rates or functional forms that might better align with your objectives.Ranking the vol_trend assigns a comparative value, while group_neutralize ensures signals are unbiased within each subindustry by eliminating systematic differences.

### 评论 #20 (作者: NP85445, 时间: 1年前)

I really like how you combine a 60-day sum of mdl110_score with a 120-day average close to capture the medium-term predictive signal. Ranking the vol_trend and then neutralizing it by subindustry is a smart way to remove sector bias and keep the signal diversified.

I would recommend testing different lookback periods and maybe adding a little volatility adjustment to make the signal even more stable.

### 评论 #26 (作者: LS21832, 时间: 1年前)

One aspect that hasn’t been discussed much is signal decay and turnover. Since  `vol_trend`  is based on a 60-day sum and 120-day mean, it’s likely to have moderate persistence but could still experience high turnover. Running auto-correlation tests on the ranked signal can help determine how long the alpha signal remains predictive.

### 评论 #27 (作者: PT27687, 时间: 1年前)

This explanation of the alpha generation strategy is quite insightful! It’s interesting how you utilize the ratio of predictive scores to historical prices to identify stocks with strong potential. I'm curious about the practical outcomes of this approach. Have you noticed any patterns or trends when applying it to specific subindustries? Would love to hear more about your observations!

---

### 评论 #28 (作者: AS59440, 时间: 1年前)

The approach of ranking vol_trend before neutralization makes sense for handling extreme values and ensuring robustness. However, alternative transformations, such as using quantile normalization or Box-Cox transformation, could further refine the distribution and improve predictive power.

---

### 评论 #29 (作者: DT23095, 时间: 1年前)

This quantitative approach refines predictive alpha by accounting for both accumulated strength and price movements while strictly controlling systematic biases through subindustry-level adjustments.

---

### 评论 #30 (作者: QN13195, 时间: 1年前)

This approach provides a structured balance between predictive signal strength and industry-neutral selection, making it potentially useful for minimizing sector biases while preserving stock-specific effects.
