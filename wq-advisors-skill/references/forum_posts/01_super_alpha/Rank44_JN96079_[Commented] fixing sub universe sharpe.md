- Avoid using multipliers related to the size of the company in your Alphas, e.g. rank(-assets), 1–rank(cap), etc. These multipliers may significantly shift the distribution of your Alpha weights to more/less liquid side and it may affect the sub-universe performance.

That's a really insightful point, KM69908! I've definitely seen sub-universe Sharpe ratios get distorted by factor weights skewing towards market cap. Have you found any particular strategies to mitigate this beyond simply avoiding those types of multipliers, perhaps in terms of rebalancing or filtering? It's a crucial detail for robust alpha development.

Great point, KM69908! Focusing on factors that don't disproportionately bias towards or against market cap can indeed lead to more robust sub-universe Sharpe ratios. Have you found that specific types of factors (e.g., fundamental, technical, sentiment) tend to be more resilient to these market cap-driven shifts in sub-universe performance? It's a crucial consideration for avoiding unintended liquidity biases.

This is a great point about how company size multipliers can inadvertently skew alpha weights and impact sub-universe Sharpe ratios. I've found that explicitly controlling for liquidity or market capitalization through other means, like a separate factor or by filtering the universe *before* applying the alpha, can be a more robust approach. Have you experimented with any specific techniques to address this potential bias beyond simply avoiding those types of multipliers?

Have you explored any specific liquidity proxies that worked particularly well for you?

---

### 评论 #13 (作者: VT42441, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a crucial point about sub-universe Sharpe! I've found that even subtle size biases can disproportionately impact performance, especially during market regime shifts.

---

### 评论 #14 (作者: KM69908, 时间: 4个月前)

That's a great point. I’ve found that residualization is a much cleaner alternative to multipliers. Instead of multiplying by size, I've been experimenting with orthogonalizing  the alpha against a Market Cap factor using  `vector_neut` .

Another technique I've found useful for protecting the sub-universe Sharpe is clipping  based on ADV. It allows the alpha to remain expressive without over-allocating to the less liquid tails

### 评论 #55 (作者: NM32020, 时间: 3个月前)

Great point about the impact of company size multipliers on sub-universe Sharpe ratios. It's crucial to realize how these can inadvertently introduce liquidity bias. Have you found that alternative weighting schemes, like industry-neutral or sector-neutral approaches, also carry their own unique biases that need careful monitoring?

---

### 评论 #56 (作者: LA79055, 时间: 3个月前)

While it's valid that size-related factors (like rank(-assets) or rank(cap)) can inadvertently skew the sub-universe Sharpe ratios by pushing more weight towards less liquid stocks, it may be useful to emphasize the importance of exploring  **alternative methods for liquidity adjustments** . A potential approach could be  **liquidity-neutral weighting** , where size factors are orthogonalized with liquidity proxies (e.g., average daily volume). This would ensure that the size factor doesn’t unintentionally create a bias towards either small-cap or large-cap stocks.
Another way to handle this is by using  **sector-neutral constraints** , which could minimize biases towards certain sectors that might be affected by market cap size.
