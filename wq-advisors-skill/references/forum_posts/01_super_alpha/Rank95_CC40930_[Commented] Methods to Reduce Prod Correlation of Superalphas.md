Superalphas are generally highly correlated and so it is difficult for them to pass prod corr test. In this post I am sharing my ways of reducing prod corr of superalphas.

Reduction in prod corr of superalpha can be done by following methods:

1) Experimenting with selection expression and smoothing the selection of alphas by using (*). Selecting some of the best alpha by specifying conditions for turnover, selecting latest alphas etc. can help reducing prod corr also and may increase the performance.

2) Experimenting with combo expression: Using various other alpha statistics, other than returns, and utilizing other operators.Forming meaningful expressions from alpha statistics can help reduce prod corr. Operators like ts_kurtosis(), ts_mean(), etc also works great and can reduce the prod corr.Also using various cross-sectional operators like hump to reduce turnover can help.

3) Experimenting with the number of days and neutralization settings can also help reduce prod corr. But be careful with decay, optimal choice of decay is less than 6.

These are the methods that I use to get my submittable superalphas.

You are encouraged to share your methods in the comment section.

Great insights on reducing prod corr for superalphas! Along with your tips, I’d suggest experimenting with dynamic grouping techniques, such as grouping alphas by shared characteristics like sector, to further diversify signals. Additionally, incorporating non-linear operators or machine learning models for alpha aggregation can sometimes uncover unique combinations that reduce prod corr while boosting performance. Balancing the frequency of alpha updates to avoid overfitting can also help maintain consistency.

that's really helpful, man! Thanks for sharing these methods. I totally agree with you on experimenting with different aspects. For the selection expression part, it makes sense to be picky about alphas based on conditions. And using combo expressions with various stats and operators indeed broadens our ways to cut down prod corr. Also, being cautious with decay when adjusting days and neutralization is crucial. I might try these out and see how it goes. Looking forward to more tips from others in the comments too.

### 评论 #14 (作者: BA51127, 时间: 1年前)

Thanks for your sharing, I have a question regarding your approach to experimenting with combo expressions. How do you determine which alpha statistics to use in forming meaningful expressions that can reduce prod correlation? Are there specific criteria or metrics you look for when selecting these statistics, or is it more of a trial-and-error process? Additionally, have you found any particular operators or alpha statistics that tend to be more effective in reducing prod correlation across different SuperAlphas?

Your approach to reducing the prod correlation of superalphas is insightful and practical. The methods you share, such as experimenting with selection expressions, smoothing, and using different alpha statistics, provide valuable ways to manage correlation while potentially improving performance. I particularly appreciate the use of operators like  `ts_kurtosis()`  and  `ts_mean()`  for diversifying the expressions, which can help refine the alphas without sacrificing signal quality.

The advice on decay settings and the importance of choosing an optimal value for better performance reflects a deep understanding of how to fine-tune strategies. Encouraging others to share their own methods fosters community collaboration and learning. This is a solid guide for anyone looking to enhance their alpha strategies while managing correlations effectively.

Thank you for sharing these methods to reduce the prod corr of superalphas. Here’s a breakdown with examples for better clarity:

1. **Refining Alpha Selection and Smoothing**
   - **Method** : Experiment with selection expressions and smooth the alpha selection using operators like  `ts_mean()`  or specific conditions for alpha rotation and updating.
   - **Example** : Choose top-performing alphas based on rolling performance over 10 days and update them every two weeks to reduce production correlation and maintain effectiveness.
2. **Using Combination Expressions**
   - **Method** : Incorporate additional alpha statistics beyond returns, like  `ts_kurtosis()`  for tail behavior or  `ts_mean()`  for averaging trends, and cross-sectional operators like  `hump`  to lower turnover.
   - **Example** : Combine  `ts_kurtosis(returns, 5)`  with  `ts_mean(price, 10)`  to create expressions that emphasize stability while avoiding overfitting.
3. **Adjusting Days and Neutralization Settings**
   - **Method** : Experiment with time horizons and optimal decay settings (less than 6) to balance predictive power and reduce production correlation.
   - **Example** : Use a 3-day window for signal decay and sector-neutralize signals to ensure consistency across market variations.

The methods shared by the expert are quite reasonable and can be effectively applied to reduce the correlation between superalphas. However, one important factor that practitioners need to pay attention to is the selection and adjustment of parameters, such as the number of days or decay factor, to optimize the performance. Specifically, keeping the decay factor below 6 can be a good guideline, but for each specific strategy, testing and fine-tuning are necessary to ensure it does not negatively impact the alpha’s performance

An alpha fails the production correlation test if it has a high correlation (over 0.7) with other alphas in the pool but does not meet the required Sharpe threshold for submission. To pass this test, two conditions must be satisfied:  **self-correlation**  and  **prod-correlation**  must both be below 0.7, and the alpha's Sharpe ratio must be at least 10% higher than each of the correlated alphas. Self-correlation measures similarity with alphas you’ve submitted, while prod-correlation evaluates correlation with all alphas in the pool.

For example, if your alpha’s Sharpe is 2.25 and it correlates with Alpha A (Sharpe 2.0) and Alpha B (Sharpe 2.10), your alpha must exceed 10% above each Sharpe: 2.2 for Alpha A and 2.31 for Alpha B. Since your alpha only meets the threshold for Alpha A but not for Alpha B, it fails the test. While self-correlation allows viewing Sharpe ratios for the top correlated alphas, prod-correlation does not provide individual Sharpe ratios, making it more challenging to meet the threshold.
