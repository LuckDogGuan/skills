Here are a few quick pointers that could help you improve your alpha research:

- Curtail outliers in alpha values by using operators like rank, power, tail, etc.
- To evaluate the robustness of an alpha, look at the rank of an alpha to see if it still performs well. This is because ranking will reveal whether the simulated PnL is generated from only a handful of stocks.
- Don’t unnecessarily try to improve the Sharpe of your alpha by simply adjusting the parameters. Your alphas should make logical sense from both a mathematical and economic perspective.
- Don’t attempt to join two weak signals to create a stronger signal.
- To avoid overfitting, choose parameters that work across different universes.
- To know how frequently a data field is updated, try simulating the data field itself. If it generates high turnover, it implies that the alpha is getting updated more often.
- Focus more on returns after achieving the minimum Sharpe and fitness thresholds. Sharpe and fitness thresholds exist to differentiate alpha signals from noise and, therefore, when you achieve the appropriate thresholds, it is better to concentrate on the simulated returns, making that your focal point.
- Large decay value can negatively impact the performance of your alpha signal. Avoid using decay simply for the sake of making a single alpha appear to have higher simulated returns. We suggest using a reasonable number of decay days in your alpha to avoid compromising the performance.
- You should strive to develop alphas with strong signals, consistent performance (over the years, across universes and regions) and explainable drawdown.

Don’t unnecessarily filter out stocks from your alpha by adding multiple conditions or by assigning NaN values to the stocks. This could end up giving a “weight concentration error.” You can read about Winsorization to control the alpha weights. Setting truncation <=0.1 in simulation settings should work for most cases.

Hello, I don't understand explainable drawdown very well. As far as I understand, as long as the return/drawdown ratio > 1, that alpha is considered good, right?

I have a problem when simulate alpha USA in top 1000 gives very good signal (sharpe > 2), however when simulate in top 3000 sharpe < 1. Why is that, I think alpha works in high liquidity market will also work well in less liquidity market. Hope to receive advice

Improve Alpha research by curtailing outliers, evaluating robustness through rank, and avoiding overfitting by using universal parameters. Focus on logical, economically sound Alphas, avoid joining weak signals, and prioritize consistent returns. Use reasonable decay values and minimize unnecessary stock filtering to maintain signal strength and avoid weight concentration errors.

How can we incorporate economic logic into alpha development to ensure that the signal is not only mathematically sound but also based on valid financial principles?

Hi TP14664! Yes, return/drawdown ratio can help you to assess whether the overall drawdown value is reasonable. Explainable drawdown typically refers to looking at the drawdown periods in the PnL chart and assessing whether they are reasonable in terms of duration, size and how to relates to the Alpha idea.

Hi QG16026! Alphas that work with more liquid stocks may not always work with less liquid stocks. It depends on the Alpha idea you're working with. For example, some news or sentiment data may work better for more liquid stocks because these stocks are usually larger companies that have better news coverage or investor interest.

Thank you for the insightful comment,  [LK29993](/hc/en-us/profiles/15761819009303-LK29993) . I completely agree that liquidity plays a key role in how an Alpha performs. More liquid stocks tend to have more information available, which can make certain strategies more effective. Your point about sentiment and news data aligning better with liquid stocks is especially relevant. Appreciate you sharing that perspective.

These pointers highlight important aspects to consider in alpha research. Key takeaways include focusing on logical and economic validity, avoiding overfitting, controlling outliers, and managing alpha weights properly. Concentrating on simulated returns after meeting Sharpe and fitness thresholds is also essential for more robust performance. Keep an eye on turnover, and ensure the decay value is reasonable to avoid harming the alpha's performance.
