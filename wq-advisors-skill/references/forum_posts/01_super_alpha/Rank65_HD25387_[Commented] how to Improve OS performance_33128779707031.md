Based on my own experience — with my Value Factor going from  **0.97 → 0.95 → 0.99**  — I’d say we can’t truly rely on IS to predict OS.

First, make sure  **Self Correlation isn’t too high** , and that your Alpha isn’t just the result of stacking data fields and operators. Ideally, it should have clear logical meaning. Try to submit Alphas with  **Turnover under 15%** , and occasionally include a few in the  **15%–50%**  range to help balance the signal. Most importantly, keep observing over time which types of Alphas tend to perform better in OS.

From my experience ---first of all....

1. **use board  but meaningful selection expressions** , like:
   - `IC > 0.02 AND Prod_corr < 0.5`
2. **Limit the number of alphas**  in the pool to avoid over-diversifying.
3. **Monitor correlation structure**  between pooled alphas.
4. Use  **Power Filters**   to refine the alpha list.
5. Try  **ensemble strategies--** combine PowerPool with other techniques like ranking or weighting.

**PowerPool alphas can strongly influence OS performance.**  Because they often have high Sharpe ratios, the optimizer gives them more weight. This can boost returns if they work well, but hurt performance if they weaken. They may also overshadow other alphas, reducing diversity in the portfolio.

To improve OS performance, make sure your PowerPool alphas are  **diverse, low in correlation** , and have  **stable performance across different regions** . Avoid overfitting by not stacking too many operators. Use  **filters like IC > 0.02 and Prod_Corr < 0.5** , and monitor self-correlation. PowerPool helps by selecting stronger alphas, but long-term OS success comes from consistent logic and signal robustness.

PowerPool alphas can influence OS performance in both positive and negative ways, depending on how they are constructed and tagged. Since PowerPool alphas are often smaller expressions with only a few operators, they tend to be simpler, higher-turnover, and more directly correlated with market moves. If too many of them are highly correlated or concentrated in similar regions or fields, they can inflate self-correlation and reduce OS robustness, which hurts performance metrics. On the other hand, well-chosen PowerPool alphas with low correlation and complementary styles can improve diversification and stabilize OS results, especially when blended with more complex alphas.
