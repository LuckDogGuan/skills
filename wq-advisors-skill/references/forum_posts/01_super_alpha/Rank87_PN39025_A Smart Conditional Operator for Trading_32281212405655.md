## 🧠 Concept: Like a **Switch + Fuse** System

The `trade_when(x, y, z)` function acts like a **logic gate** for trading signals:

- **Switch (`x`)**: When a condition is met, apply the new trading signal (`y`)

- **Fuse (`z`)**: If a danger condition is triggered, force an exit (set to `NaN`)

- **Otherwise**: Hold the previous position to avoid over-trading

## 🧩 Parameter Breakdown

### 1. `x`: **Trigger Condition**

> _When should the signal be updated?_

Example:

x = volume >= ts_sum(volume, 5) / 5

> “Trigger a new signal only when volume is above the 5-day average.”

### 2. `y`: **New Signal (Alpha)**

> _What signal to use if triggered?_

Example:

y = rank(-returns)

> “Short the stocks that have gained the most recently.”

### 3. `z`: **Exit Condition**

> _When to force an immediate exit?_

Example:

z = abs(returns) > 0.1

> “Exit if daily price move exceeds ±10%.”

## 🚦 Signal Logic (Like a Traffic Light)

| Condition          | Output Signal (`αₜ`)         | Meaning                          |

|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|

| `zₜ > 0`           | `NaN`                        | 🔴 Force exit                    |

| `xₜ > 0`           | `yₜ`                         | 🟢 New signal                    |

| Else               | `αₜ = αₜ₋₁`                 | 🟡 Hold previous position        |

## 📈 Financial Use Case Examples

### ✅ Example 1: Only Trade on Volume Spike

trade_when(

volume >= ts_sum(volume, 5)/5,

rank(-returns),

-1  # Never trigger exit

)

- **Use Case**: Enter short only when volume spikes

- **Behavior**:

- 🟢 Volume Spike → New signal applied

- 🟡 Otherwise → Hold previous signal

- ❌ No forced exit → `z = -1` is always false

### ⚠️ Example 2: Exit on Large Daily Moves

trade_when(

volume >= ts_sum(volume, 5)/5,

rank(-returns),

abs(returns) > 0.1

)

- **Use Case**: Momentum reversal with risk control

- **Behavior**:

- 💥 Daily return exceeds ±10% → Exit immediately (set to NaN)

- 🟢 Volume spike, no big move → Apply new signal

- 🟡 No volume spike, no risk → Hold previous position

## 🧮 Mathematical Insight

### Why Not Use `y_t` Directly?

Using raw `y_t` without conditions assumes:

- You always want to update your position

- High-frequency signal changes are acceptable

- No concern for execution costs or slippage

`trade_when()` allows conditional control:

- Reduce turnover

- Add dynamic risk filters

- Increase interpretability

## 💰 Why Use `trade_when()`?

| Benefit              | Explanation                                                                 |

|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 🎯 Precision          | Act only on meaningful triggers (`x`)                                       |

| 🛡 Risk Control       | Force exit under danger (`z`)                                                |

| 🧠 Readability        | Clean, logical structure for signal generation                              |

| 🔧 Modularity         | Easy to combine multiple strategies                                          |

| 💸 Cost Efficiency    | Minimize noise trading and reduce transaction fees                         |

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: What if I don’t want any exit condition?**

→ Set `z = -1`, which is always false, so exit will never trigger.

**Q: Why use `ts_sum(volume, 5)/5` instead of `sma(volume, 5)`?**

→ It's the same thing — a 5-day average volume.

**Q: What does `NaN` mean in the output signal?**

→ It means "close all positions" — you're exiting that stock entirely.

## 🧵 One-line Summary

trade_when(x, y, z) = 🚦 Three-light signal system + 🛑 Emergency brake

Use this operator, and your strategy will act more like a **calm sniper** than a **panicking rookie**.

Really appreciate you breaking down the  `trade_when`  operator — it’s a very intuitive and practical way to manage trading signals. The metaphor of a  **Switch + Fuse**  makes it easy to understand how to combine entry triggers with risk controls cleanly. I love how it avoids needless trades by holding previous positions, which should help reduce trading friction and improve net returns. The use cases you provided, especially the volume spike trigger combined with an exit on large daily moves, are clear and actionable. Looking forward to implementing this logic in my own trading framework — thanks for sharing such a thoughtful approach!

Brilliant analogy!  The "Switch + Fuse" model perfectly captures the intent behind  `trade_when()`  — controlled activation with built-in safeguards. Love how it balances signal discipline with risk management. This operator really is a game-changer for reducing noise and overtrading. Thanks for demystifying it so clearly!
