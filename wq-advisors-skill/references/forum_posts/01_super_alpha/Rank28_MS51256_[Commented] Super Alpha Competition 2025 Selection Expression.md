This could be an example of how to select alpha category SIMPLE with sample  in(competitions, "SIMPLE") and turnover < 0.5 and is_recent(alpha, 60)

If you're aiming to filter and select only those alphas categorized as  `SIMPLE`  and showing strong performance, you can use a straightforward selection expression:
 `classification = 'SIMPLE' and fitness > 0.5` .
This will return all alphas that are labeled as  `SIMPLE`  and have a fitness score above 0.5, indicating potential robustness and quality.

The  `SIMPLE`  classification generally refers to alphas that use fewer operators, fewer datasets, and maintain a compact structure. These alphas are often easier to interpret and can serve as strong foundational components in broader strategies. Filtering by classification and performance metrics like fitness is a smart way to narrow your focus and identify high-potential candidates.

If you're interested in exploring other types of classifications—such as  `ADVANCED` ,  `COMPLEX` , or  `GENIUS` —or combining filters like turnover, universe, or region, there are many ways to customize your selection strategy.

Are you sure? I dont think Worldquant Brain provides these classification.

in the ace2023  we can use the selection : ont(own)&&in (competitions,"ACE2023"）&&turnover<0.3&&prod_corrlation<0.5&&dataset_count<3
to choose those good alpha to combo a super alpha

classification == "SIMPLE"
This expression filters and selects only those alphas classified as SIMPLE. Use it in the Selection Expression field when constructing your Super Al

The following are the selection expressions for different Categories in the Super Alpha Competition 2025.

You can combine other metrics such as self-correlation, prod_correlation, operator_count, and turnover to formulate high-quality selection expressions.

- ATOM Alphas                                   in(classifications,"ATOM")

- Simple Alphas                                  in(classifications,"SIMPLE")

- Risk Neutralized Alphas                   not(own)&&((neutralization == "SLOW") || (neutralization == "FAST") || (neutralization == "SLOW_AND_FAST") || (neutralization == "CROWDING") || (neutralization == "STATISTICAL")

- Power Pool Alphas                           in(classifications,"POWER POOL")

- High Capacity Alphas (HCAC)         in(competitions,“HCAC2025")

- ACE Alphas                                      in(competitions，"ACE2023")

Focusing on the 'SIMPLE' classification is a great strategy. I find these alphas are usually more robust and way easier to diagnose if something goes wrong. They make perfect foundational building blocks for a Super Alpha before you start adding more complex signals.

To find high-performing SIMPLE alphas, use:  `classification = 'SIMPLE' and fitness > 0.5` . SIMPLE alphas are compact and interpretable. You can also explore ADVANCED, COMPLEX, or GENIUS types by combining filters like turnover or region.

This alpha selection method is very useful for quickly identifying strong and easy-to-understand candidates. By filtering with  `classification = 'SIMPLE' and fitness > 0.5` , you focus on alphas that are compact and potentially robust. SIMPLE alphas often have fewer operators and datasets, making them easier to analyze and combine. Using fitness as a performance measure helps ensure quality. This is a great starting point before exploring more complex classifications or adding additional filters like turnover or region.

If your goal is to isolate high-performing alphas labeled as SIMPLE, a basic yet effective filtering expression would be:

`classification = 'SIMPLE' and fitness > 0.5
`

This condition returns alphas that are not only structurally simple but also demonstrate a fitness score above 0.5—often a sign of potential robustness and signal quality.

The SIMPLE label typically applies to alphas that utilize fewer operators, minimal datasets, and follow a compact, interpretable logic. These alphas can be valuable building blocks for broader portfolios due to their clarity and efficiency. Using classification and fitness as filters is a practical way to focus your search and prioritize strong candidates.

If you're curious to explore beyond SIMPLE, other categories like ADVANCED, COMPLEX, or GENIUS offer alternative design philosophies. You can also layer in additional filters such as turnover, universe, or region to tailor your selection strategy to specific goals or portfolio needs.

If you're looking to filter for high-performing, easy-to-understand alphas, a simple expression like  `classification = 'SIMPLE' and fitness > 0.5`  is highly effective. This selects alphas that are labeled as SIMPLE—typically those built with fewer operators, limited datasets, and a more compact structure—while also ensuring a fitness score above 0.5, signaling solid performance and robustness. SIMPLE alphas are often easier to interpret and can serve as reliable building blocks in larger, more complex strategies. Using both classification and performance filters allows for a more targeted and efficient selection process.

If you're looking for high-performing  **SIMPLE**  alphas, try filtering with  `classification = 'SIMPLE'`  and  `turnover > 0.1` . These alphas are typically more compact and easier to interpret. You can also branch out to other categories like  **ADVANCED** ,  **COMPLEX** , or  **GENIUS**  by layering in filters such as region or turnover to refine your search further.

Filtering with  `classification = 'SIMPLE' and turnover > 0.5`  is a great way to surface clean, interpretable alphas with strong baseline performance.
