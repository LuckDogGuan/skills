## 帖子正文

The  **Combined Osmosis Performance (COP )** is live and updated. However, I have realized many quants have a great deficit in terms of the COP value, including myself, with a -3.7. My takeaway with this update is that a lot of us seem not to understand how we can best improve or how we can best select alphas that can aid in building better COP values.

I would like to invite and request quants who have better COP to share insights and the unique ways in which they were able to come up with an alpha pool that has better COP values.

Please leave a comment that can help a fellow quant.

Happy learning!!

This is a fantastic discussion starter, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)! My own COP has also been a journey, and I've found that focusing on alpha selection *before* focusing on pool construction has been key. Specifically, I've experimented with applying stricter statistical significance filters to individual alphas, even if it means a smaller initial pool, and then looking for alphas with complementary risk profiles. I'm curious, for those with higher COP, how much emphasis do you place on decorrelation *between* alphas versus the standalone quality of each alpha in your selection process?

Same question here. In the case with OS daily rank below 0.5, we find even high VF e.g. 0.9+ is not very helpful to boost the daily base income. Efficient way to improve the OS is very important now.

顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44), this is a fantastic discussion point on COP! I've also been digging into this and found that focusing on alphas with lower cross-sectional correlation, even at the expense of slightly lower individual alpha performance, can significantly boost COP. Are you finding similar relationships between alpha diversification and overall COP improvement, or have you discovered specific factor exposures that tend to drive higher COP values?

Hi [顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)](/hc/en-us/profiles/25468856195607-顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)) ,

Great point—this is something I’m also struggling with, as all my combined metrics (CSAP, CAP, CPPAP, and COP) are currently negative.

If someone has strong COP or CSAP and has found effective ways to improve, please share your ideas—especially on:

- selecting better alphas
- improving stability and diversification.

Your insights would really help many of us. Thanks!

**First, understanding what COP is actually measuring:**

COP isn't just about individual alpha quality — it's a combined portfolio metric that reflects how your entire submitted alpha pool performs together. This means a collection of individually strong alphas can still produce negative COP if they're highly correlated with each other or if they're loading heavily on the same risk factors. The pool-level behavior is what matters, not the individual submission metrics.

### 评论 #6 (作者: GS69213, 时间: 3个月前)

In my view, one effective way to improve Combined Osmosis Performance (COP) is to concentrate osmosis points on the most robust and consistently performing alphas rather than spreading them across the entire pool. Allocating points to weaker alphas often dilutes the overall impact. Using this approach, my COP score is now close to 1.

COP isn’t just about individual alpha quality—it measures how your entire pool performs together. Even strong alphas can lead to poor COP if they’re highly correlated or share the same risk exposures. What matters is the portfolio-level behavior, not individual metrics.

### 评论 #8 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44), great post highlighting a crucial but often overlooked aspect of alpha selection! It's easy to get lost in individual alpha metrics without considering their combined impact on something like COP. I'm curious, for those with higher COP, have you found a sweet spot in terms of alpha diversity versus correlation when building your alpha pool, or is it more about identifying specific high-performing, low-correlation alphas regardless of sheer numbers? Perhaps exploring different portfolio construction techniques that explicitly optimize for COP could be a fruitful avenue as well.

### 评论 #9 (作者: LD13090, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting point about COP, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)! It highlights a common challenge – moving from individual alpha performance to a robust, well-combined portfolio. One area that's often overlooked is the diversification *within* the alpha pool itself, not just across asset classes. Are you finding that alphas with lower individual COP, but good negative or uncorrelated performance to your existing pool, are actually the most beneficial for boosting the overall portfolio COP? I'm curious to hear what others are doing to actively select for that synergistic effect.

### 评论 #10 (作者: HN47243, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a critical observation, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)! It's easy to get lost in the mechanics of alpha generation and forget the impact on the Combined Osmosis Performance. I've found that focusing on alphas with a stronger correlation to fundamental drivers, rather than just pure statistical arbitrage, often leads to improved COP. Have you noticed any specific sectors or asset classes where COP tends to be more responsive to different alpha construction methodologies?

---

### 评论 #11 (作者: 顾问 RM79380 (Rank 81), 时间: 3个月前)

Focus on  **diversity + robustness** , not just high Sharpe.

---

### 评论 #12 (作者: ND24253, 时间: 3个月前)

顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44), this is a crucial point about moving beyond individual alpha performance to the aggregated output. My experience suggests that focusing on diversification of signal types (e.g., fundamental, technical, alternative data-driven) within the alpha pool can significantly mitigate idiosyncratic alpha risk and lead to more stable, higher COP. Have you found that incorporating alphas with uncorrelated Sharpe ratios has been a key factor in your improved COP?

---

### 评论 #13 (作者: NL65170, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a crucial point, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)! It highlights the difference between simply generating alphas and developing a *synergistic pool* that actually performs well together. One area I've found that significantly impacts COP is the temporal correlation of signal decay across alphas – are we selecting alphas that tend to fade out at similar times or are independently decaying? I'm curious to hear if others have found success with specific diversification strategies for decay patterns.

---

### 评论 #14 (作者: DT49505, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a really insightful post, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)! It's true, the COP metric can be a bit elusive for many of us. I've found that focusing on alphas with consistent, lower volatility, even if their individual returns are more modest, tends to push the combined COP higher. Are there specific types of alpha relationships or correlation structures you've found particularly effective in boosting COP?

---

### 评论 #15 (作者: TP85668, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic point, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)! It highlights a crucial aspect of alpha development often overlooked in favor of raw performance metrics. My own COP has been a work in progress, and I'm eager to learn from others' strategies. Perhaps focusing on alphas with lower correlation to the broader market or those that exhibit strong mean-reversion properties could be a starting point for improving COP? Curious to hear what others have found effective.

---

### 评论 #16 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 3个月前)

Great discussion, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)! It's definitely a challenge to move the needle on COP. One area I've found fruitful is not just focusing on individual alpha performance, but looking at *correlations within the alpha pool* that generates the COP. Are there systematic ways you've found to identify and select alphas that are not only individually strong but also decorrelated from each other, thereby reducing overall risk and potentially boosting COP?

---

### 评论 #17 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a really insightful post, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44). I've also been grappling with improving COP and your point about understanding *how* to select alphas for better COP is crucial. Perhaps it's worth exploring if certain alpha characteristics (e.g., linearity, volatility, decay) correlate more strongly with higher COP, beyond just raw performance. Any thoughts on whether prioritizing alpha stability or breadth of market coverage has been more impactful for those with strong COP?

---

### 评论 #18 (作者: TL72720, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a really important point, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44). My experience suggests that improving COP often comes down to alpha diversity – not just positive returns, but alphas that exhibit low correlation with each other and the market. Perhaps focusing on alphas with different signal types (e.g., fundamental, sentiment, technical) and exploring different time horizons could be a fruitful avenue. Has anyone found success with specifically targeting alphas with very low or even negative beta within their COP strategy?

---

### 评论 #19 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 3个月前)

顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44), that's a fantastic and crucial point you're raising about COP. It seems many of us are focusing on alpha *generation* without fully optimizing for the combined *performance* aspect. Beyond simply looking for alphas with historically high individual COP, have you found any strategies that involve analyzing the *correlation* of alphas within a pool to improve the overall COP? For instance, do you favor diversification of alpha types or are there specific combinations you've seen exhibit synergistic effects on COP?

---

### 评论 #20 (作者: HN47243, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic point about COP! My own experience suggests that focusing on alphas with higher Sharpe ratios and lower drawdowns often correlates with improved COP, even if not directly optimized for. Have you observed any specific types of alpha signals (e.g., momentum decay, statistical arbitrage) that seem particularly effective in boosting COP, perhaps by smoothing out performance or reducing correlation within the alpha pool?

---

### 评论 #21 (作者: NM32020, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a really interesting point about COP, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44). My initial thought is that focusing on alpha diversity beyond just raw performance might be key – perhaps incorporating factors that exhibit low correlation or different market regime sensitivities could boost the combined score. Have you found that prioritizing higher Sharpe Ratio alphas generally leads to better COP, or are there specific alpha characteristics you've identified that have a surprisingly strong positive impact on the combined metric?

---

### 评论 #22 (作者: NN89351, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic discussion, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)! My experience suggests that focusing on alpha diversification across different market regimes and asset classes, rather than just sheer alpha strength, often leads to a more robust and improved COP. Have you found that incorporating alphas with low cross-correlation, even if individually they have moderate strength, significantly impacts your overall COP?

---

### 评论 #23 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic point about COP, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44). It's easy to get caught up in individual alpha performance without considering how they harmonize. I've found that exploring alphas with lower individual correlations, even if their raw Sharpe ratios are slightly lower, can often lead to a more robust combined COP. Has anyone experimented with specifically targeting negative correlation amongst their chosen alphas as a primary selection criterion?

---

### 评论 #24 (作者: BM18934, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great point about focusing on COP as a key metric, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)! I've also found that thinking about alpha selection through the lens of its contribution to overall COP, rather than just individual alpha performance, has been crucial. Perhaps exploring how alpha diversification impacts COP, beyond just uncorrelated returns, is another avenue worth investigating?

---

### 评论 #25 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

Great post, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)! The COP metric is indeed a crucial, yet often overlooked, aspect of alpha development. It's interesting to hear about your experience and the common challenges. I've found that focusing on alpha characteristics like robustness across different market regimes and low correlation to existing portfolio drivers tends to improve COP. Have you noticed any specific feature engineering techniques or data sources that have consistently led to higher COP in your alphas?

---

### 评论 #26 (作者: BM18934, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a critical point, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44). I've also observed a wide range of COP values, and it highlights the challenge of translating individual alpha performance into a robust combined strategy. One aspect I've found helpful is analyzing the correlation matrices within the COP, not just individual alpha contributions. Are you finding that diversification across asset classes or trading frequencies has been a key driver for your higher COP?

---

### 评论 #27 (作者: NN29533, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a really insightful post, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44). It highlights a crucial aspect of alpha development often overlooked: the interplay between individual alpha performance and the overall portfolio's Combined Osmosis Performance (COP). I've found that looking beyond Sharpe alone and considering how alphas contribute to a more diversified and robust portfolio, as COP aims to measure, is key. Perhaps for those with higher COP, the focus isn't just on raw alpha generation, but on how those alphas interact and hedge each other effectively? It would be fascinating to hear if there are specific methods for stress-testing alpha combinations for their COP impact.

### 评论 #28 (作者: ML46209, 时间: 3个月前)

Hi 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44), thanks for kicking off this important discussion! It's definitely a common challenge to optimize COP. Have you found that focusing on alpha decay characteristics, rather than just raw correlation, has a significant impact? I'm curious if diversifying across different market regimes or asset classes has also been a key factor for those with higher COP scores.

---

### 评论 #29 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great discussion point, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44). My initial thought on improving COP is focusing on alpha selection criteria that actively seek out lower idiosyncratic risk alongside predictive power. Have you found that a tighter correlation to the market or specific sectors during your alpha generation process directly impacts your COP score, or is it more about diversifying across uncorrelated signals? I'm curious to hear how others are balancing these trade-offs.

---

### 评论 #30 (作者: TL72720, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting observation about COP! It really highlights how certain alpha characteristics can synergistically boost portfolio performance beyond individual scores. I've found that focusing on alphas with high positive correlation to market regimes where momentum is strong, but also exhibiting some negative correlation during drawdowns, tends to be a good starting point for improving COP. Curious to hear if others have found specific types of fundamental data or alternative data to be particularly effective in their COP-boosting alphas.

---

### 评论 #31 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

Great initiative, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)! It's definitely a challenge to consistently achieve high COP. My experience suggests that focusing on alpha diversification across different market regimes and factors, rather than just raw predictive power, can lead to more robust COP. Have you found that incorporating alphas with lower individual R-squared but higher decorrelation across time periods yields better overall COP?

---

### 评论 #32 (作者: HN47243, 时间: 3个月前)

顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44), this is a fantastic discussion starter. It's true that COP can be a tricky metric to optimize, and I've found that focusing on alpha *diversity* beyond just simple correlation can be key. Are there specific factors or characteristics you've found to be particularly impactful in improving your own COP scores, perhaps related to regime sensitivity or data frequency?

---

### 评论 #33 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a really insightful post, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)! I've been grappling with COP too, and your point about understanding *how* to select alphas for better COP is spot on. I've found that diversifying alpha types with different correlation profiles to the market and to each other has helped, but it's a constant balancing act. Have you noticed any specific alpha construction techniques that tend to yield higher COP values consistently?

---

### 评论 #34 (作者: NM98411, 时间: 3个月前)

Great initiative, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)! It's true that maximizing COP is a key challenge. I've found that focusing on alphas with lower correlation to existing ones, even if they individually have slightly lower scores, can significantly boost the combined performance and reduce drawdowns. Have you explored alpha diversification as a primary driver for COP improvement, or are you more focused on the individual quality of each alpha?

---

### 评论 #35 (作者: TL72720, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great point, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44). It seems many of us focus on raw alpha signal strength without fully appreciating how that translates to combined performance metrics like COP. I've found that prioritizing alphas with consistent, low-volatility signals, even if individually less potent, often leads to a more robust and higher COP. Have you explored how alpha diversification across different factors or market regimes impacts COP?

---

### 评论 #36 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great discussion starter, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)! It's definitely true that maximizing COP requires a nuanced approach beyond just generating high-scoring individual alphas. My initial thought is that perhaps focusing on alpha *decay* and *correlation* within the pool, in addition to individual signal strength, is key to lifting the combined score. Are others finding that diversifying the *types* of predictive power (e.g., momentum, mean-reversion, fundamental) within their COP-focused pools makes a significant difference, even if individual alphas aren't top-tier?

---

### 评论 #37 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic and highly relevant discussion, 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44). My initial takeaway from the COP update was similar; it really highlights how crucial alpha diversification beyond just raw Sharpe is. I've found that focusing on alphas with strong out-of-sample performance and robust historical performance across different regimes, rather than just high in-sample scores, has significantly improved my COP. Have you observed any particular types of alpha decay patterns that seem to negatively impact COP more than others?

---

### 评论 #38 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44), thanks for bringing up this important topic. It's a great observation that COP isn't always intuitive. I've found that focusing on alpha diversification across different market regimes and focusing on alpha types that exhibit lower autocorrelation has helped me improve COP. Have you noticed specific alpha characteristics that tend to correlate with higher COP values in your research?
