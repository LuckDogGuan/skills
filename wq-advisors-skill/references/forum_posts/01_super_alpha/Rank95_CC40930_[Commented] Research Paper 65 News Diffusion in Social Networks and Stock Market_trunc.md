## 帖子正文

We study how the social transmission of public news influences investors' beliefs and securities markets. Using data on investor social networks, we find that earnings announcements from firms in higher-centrality locations generate stronger immediate price, volatility, and trading volume reactions. Post announcement, such firms experience weaker price drift and faster volatility decay but higher and more persistent volume. This evidence suggests that greater social connectedness promotes timely incorporation of news into prices, but also opinion divergence and excessive trading. We propose the social churning hypothesis and present supporting evidence with granular data from StockTwits messages and household trading records.

Hi, can I summarize the paper in the following way:

1. Research question:

The author tried to study the causal relation between [social transmision of public news](cause) and [investors' beliefs] and [securities markets](effect).

2. Research data:

The author look at data on investor social networks to answer this question.

3. Research finding:

Firms in higher-centrality locations (characteristics)
generate stronger immediate price, volatility and trading volume reactions (trading results)

If we take the announcements time as a threshold, the such firms experience the following phenomenon:
a. weaker price drift
b. faster volatility decay
c. higher and more persistent volume.

Those phenomenon suggests the following causal relations:
greater social connectness promotes timely incorporation of news into three phenomenon:
a. prices
b. opinion divergence
c. excessive trading.

Based on the above evidence, the author propose
the social churning hypothesis
and presenting supporting evidences analyzed from
Stocktwits messages and household trading records.

What do you think of my summary?

Best regards,

Hi!

Thank you for the summary, it is very well-structured.

Have you attempted to extract some idea from it to incorporate into the alpha?

Great!

Thank you for your suggestion. I am trying to do so!

It would be great if we can find a way to translate the causal relation in this paper into concrete Alphas ideas! Can the following process work?

Firstly, the cause is social transmission of public news and social connectedness, which could be measured and represented by how much the stocks are discussed on social media, that may be captured by looking at Tweet volume (snt_social_value).

Secondly, the effect are prices, opinion divergence and excessive trading. Here, I am trying to find data fields that are on theme social media or news, therefore, we could look at sentiment Z score(snt_social_value) and sentiment volume (snt12_alltype_buzzvec) that tell us how the stocks is evaluated on social media using sentiment score.

Thirdly, to capture the causal relation, we may use operator that reflect the correlation or causal relationship such as ts_corr or ts_regression,...

Can you help me look at the above process? Thanks!

Best regards.

Yes, the process sounds good 👍. You could consider incorporating geographic data available in the data explorer, such as zip codes or county codes. Grouping by these fields could further represent 'connectivity'. Additionally, you might want to consider the potential delay between cause and effect. The paper suggests that news are incorporated into prices in a timely manner, but you may want to experiment with different time lags.

the process sounds good 👍. BUT, here's my take on the process you've outlined:

1. **Social Transmission Measurement** : You're correct that social media activity, particularly tweet volume and sentiment, can serve as a proxy for social transmission of public news. The data fields you've identified, such as  `snt_social_volume`  and  `snt_social_value` , are indeed relevant for capturing the volume and sentiment of stock discussions on platforms like StockTwits.
2. **Effect Variables** : The effects you've highlighted—price movement, opinion divergence, and trading volume—are well-aligned with the paper's findings. The data fields  `snt_social_value`  for sentiment Z-score and  `scl12_alltype_buzzvec`  for sentiment volume are good choices for gauging market sentiment on social media.
3. **Causal Relationship Operators** : Using operators like  `ts_corr`  or  `ts_regression`  to establish correlations or causal relationships is a strategic approach. These can help you quantify how changes in social media sentiment and volume precede or coincide with changes in stock prices and trading volumes.

This article provides an insightful exploration of how news dissemination through social networks influences stock market behavior. By linking information diffusion with investor reactions, the authors contribute to the understanding of market efficiency and behavioral finance.

**Strengths:**

1. **Interdisciplinary Approach** : The study bridges social network theory and financial markets, shedding light on how the structure and dynamics of information flow impact stock prices.
2. **Behavioral Insights** : It highlights the role of investor psychology and collective behavior in amplifying or muting the effects of news on market movements.
3. **Practical Relevance** : Understanding how news spreads and influences asset prices is crucial for traders, policymakers, and regulators in managing risks associated with misinformation or herd behavior.

**Potential Areas for Further Development:**

1. **Empirical Validation** : Incorporating case studies or historical events (e.g., viral news stories) to demonstrate the relationship between news diffusion and market reactions would strengthen the study’s empirical basis.
2. **Network Analysis Details** : Providing more detail on the types of social networks analyzed (e.g., social media platforms, professional networks) and their characteristics could offer greater clarity and specificity.
3. **Impact of Misinformation** : Exploring how the spread of false or misleading news affects investor behavior and market efficiency would add depth to the analysis.
4. **Policy Implications** : Discussing how regulators could address challenges arising from rapid news diffusion, such as market manipulation or flash crashes, could enhance the practical value of the study.

This research makes a significant contribution to the growing field of information-driven finance, offering valuable insights into the interplay between social networks, news dissemination, and market dynamics.

Your approach has merit. Using tweet volume and sentiment scores to represent social transmission and its effects is reasonable. However, as others pointed out, considering time lags is crucial as there's often a delay between cause and effect. Also, exploring more network details like different social media platforms used could make the analysis more precise. And don't forget to test various lag settings when using those operators for correlations. Overall, it's a good start but needs refinement for better alpha generation.

The paper by Hirshleifer, Peng, and Wang (2021) studies how public news in social networks affects investors and markets. They find that earnings announcements from more central firms have stronger immediate impacts. Key data fields include tweet volume (snt_social_volume), sentiment Z score (snt_social_value), and sentiment volume (scl12_alltype_buzzvec). This research shows the importance of social connectedness in news diffusion and its effects on stock market reactions. It could be useful for understanding market dynamics and potentially for factor construction related to news sentiment and social media activity.

The study examines how the dissemination of public news through social networks affects investor behavior and securities markets. It finds that firms situated in regions with higher social network centrality experience more pronounced immediate reactions in stock price, volatility, and trading volume following earnings announcements. Subsequently, these firms exhibit reduced price drift, quicker volatility reduction, but sustained elevated trading volumes. This suggests that increased social connectedness facilitates prompt assimilation of news into stock prices, yet also leads to differing opinions and heightened trading activity. The researchers introduce the "social churning hypothesis," supported by detailed data from StockTwits messages and individual trading records.

### 评论 #21 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

The research suggests that social connectedness enhances the speed at which public news is reflected in stock prices, reducing informational inefficiencies in the market. This rapid assimilation benefits investors seeking to capitalize on new information.

---

### 评论 #22 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

Despite the benefits of quick information dissemination, increased social connectedness can lead to varying interpretations of news, causing opinion divergence. This divergence is a driving factor behind the observed excessive trading volumes.

---

### 评论 #23 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

The study finds that while initial volatility spikes post-announcement are more pronounced in highly connected regions, the subsequent decay in volatility is faster. This pattern suggests that social networks play a complex role in influencing market stability.

---

### 评论 #24 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

The correlation between social connectedness and excessive trading raises questions about market efficiency. While rapid information dissemination is beneficial, the resulting overtrading may lead to increased transaction costs and potential market distortions.

That’s a great approach! Leveraging sentiment analysis from social media platforms like StockTwits or Twitter can provide real-time insights into market sentiment, allowing you to capture rapid market movements. Here are a few strategies you could explore:

1. **Sentiment Z-Scores** : By calculating sentiment Z-scores for relevant tweets or posts, you can identify unusually high or low sentiment that could signal a potential market reaction.
2. **Tweet Volume and Event Detection** : Track tweet volume around earnings announcements or major news releases. A spike in volume, especially with strong sentiment, could indicate a shift in investor behavior.
3. **Lag Analysis** : Study the time lag between sentiment changes and price movements. By understanding this lag, you can optimize entry and exit points, making your trades more timely.
4. **Social Network Centrality** : Incorporate data on social network centrality, focusing on high-centrality influencers whose opinions may lead to faster diffusion of news and stronger market reactions.

By integrating these factors into your high-frequency trading models, you’ll be able to better capture those rapid price movements and adjust your strategies for maximum profitability. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any of these ideas!
