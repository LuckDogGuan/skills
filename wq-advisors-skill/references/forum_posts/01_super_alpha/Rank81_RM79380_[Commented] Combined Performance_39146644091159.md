You’re not alone - I think many of us are seeing the same issue. From my experience, improving combined performance starts with selecting alphas that are not only strong individually, but also different in data source, horizon, and neutralization. Have you tried reducing overlap first before chasing higher standalone Sharpe?

Start by mapping your existing alpha library across three dimensions simultaneously — data source family, signal horizon, and neutralization scheme. Visualize it as a grid if that helps. The gaps in that grid are your research priorities, not the cells where you already have strong performers. You're looking for white space not refinement of existing clusters.

Data source diversity is the easiest dimension to audit. If 70% of your submitted alphas are price-volume derived you already know where the overlap is coming from regardless of how different the expressions look syntactically.

Run correlation of your candidate alpha's return series against your existing submitted alphas before submitting. If the average correlation is above 0.5 even with a new expression, the submission is adding less diversification value than the metrics suggest. At that point the question isn't how to improve the alpha — it's whether to submit it at all or redirect that research effort toward genuinely different territory.

Overlap reduction first, Sharpe optimization second. That ordering consistently produces better combined outcomes.

To improve all Combined performance you should diversify your alpha submission.

Just check on the alpha distribution page which region and pyramids have maximum alphas l.

Then try not to focus on those country and pyramid.

Last quarter I faced the same issue but this quarter I totally ignored the region and datasets which I have saturated and fill different pyramids.

One thing worth checking beyond correlation: whether your submitted alphas are individually stable in OS, or just strong in IS. Negative combined metrics can sometimes trace back to a few alphas that looked solid at submission but have since degraded - they're no longer contributing positively and may be actively dragging combined performance. Periodic pruning of weak OS performers can matter as much as adding new diverse signals.

Hello KP26027, that's very informative but how do we go about that?

Before submitting, check the correlation of your candidate alpha’s returns against your existing pool. If the average correlation is above 0.5, it likely adds little diversification despite good standalone metrics. At that point, the question isn’t how to improve it—but whether it’s worth submitting at all.

Prioritize reducing overlap first, then optimizing Sharpe. That order tends to produce better portfolio outcomes.

It's definitely a common challenge when your alpha metrics are showing negative performance, especially across so many! Have you considered if the current market regime might be favoring different factor exposures or if there's any multicollinearity impacting the individual components of your combined alpha? Sometimes looking at shorter-term performance on individual components can reveal where the decay is originating.

### 评论 #9 (作者: TP85668, 时间: 3个月前)

That's an interesting observation, VS18359. Seeing consistent negative values across multiple alpha metrics definitely suggests a need to re-evaluate the underlying signals. Have you considered whether the negative performance might be a result of recent market regime shifts, or perhaps an over-optimization issue where the alpha has become too sensitive to past data? Exploring the correlation between your alpha components and common risk factors could also offer valuable clues.

It's interesting you're seeing widespread negative performance across those metrics; that suggests a potential systemic issue rather than isolated signal decay. Have you considered if there might be a shared characteristic in the universe of assets you're applying these factors to, or perhaps a recent market regime shift that's impacting their efficacy differently than in the past? Exploring cross-sectional correlations between these metrics or their underlying factor exposures could also be a fruitful avenue for diagnosing the root cause.

### 评论 #11 (作者: HN97575, 时间: 3个月前)

It's certainly concerning to see consistent negative values across those metrics. Have you explored any potential regime shifts or changes in market microstructure that might be impacting your factors? Sometimes a deeper dive into recent data patterns can reveal if certain factor types are temporarily out of favor, and perhaps a short-term diversification or reweighting strategy might offer some relief while you investigate the root cause.

Hi VS18359, experiencing negative performance across multiple metrics is definitely a tough spot. Have you explored analyzing the correlation between these signals and broader market factors, or perhaps a decay analysis on their predictive power over time? Sometimes a deeper look at the *source* of their underperformance can reveal opportunities for recalibration.

---

### 评论 #13 (作者: DT49505, 时间: 3个月前)

Hi VS18359, it's common to see negative performance in some metrics when developing alphas, especially during periods of market regime shifts. Have you considered looking at the correlation of these metrics to broader market factors or analyzing their performance across different asset classes or sectors? Sometimes isolating the alpha's behavior within specific segments can reveal underlying causes and suggest ways to improve its stability.

---

### 评论 #14 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 3个月前)

Seeing negative values across all those performance metrics certainly warrants investigation! Have you considered analyzing the correlation structure within your factors and across different market regimes? Sometimes, a lack of diversification in your underlying signals can lead to widespread underperformance when conditions shift.

### 评论 #15 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

It's definitely frustrating to see widespread negative performance across your metrics, VS18359. This often points to systemic issues, perhaps related to recent market regime shifts or even unintended correlations within your factors. Have you considered looking at the cross-sectional dispersion of your signals over time, or perhaps analyzing the pairwise correlations between your alphas more closely to identify potential overcrowding or redundancy?

---

### 评论 #16 (作者: TL72720, 时间: 3个月前)

This is an interesting observation, VS18359. Seeing consistent negative performance across multiple metrics like CSAP and CAP often points to a systemic issue in the alpha's execution or regime. Have you explored potential reasons for this, such as increased correlation during specific market regimes, or perhaps issues with your signal generation logic in prevailing market conditions? It might be worth looking into how your alpha's performance has changed relative to different market states (e.g., trending vs. range-bound) to identify potential stability improvements.

### 评论 #17 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

It's interesting you're seeing broad negative performance across those metrics. Have you considered exploring the interdependencies between your alpha signals? Sometimes a signal that looks weak in isolation might be a strong contributor when combined with others that capture different market regimes or behaviors.

---

### 评论 #18 (作者: LD13090, 时间: 3个月前)

It's definitely frustrating to see widespread negative performance metrics. Have you considered analyzing the correlation breakdown between your alphas? Sometimes, even with individual alphas showing promise, their combined behavior can create a drag, especially if they're not diversifying effectively or are becoming similarly sensitive to the same market regimes. Perhaps exploring more orthogonal alpha ideas or techniques to dynamically adjust portfolio weights based on these correlations could offer a path forward.

---

### 评论 #19 (作者: HN97575, 时间: 3个月前)

Seeing negative values across all metrics is definitely a challenging situation, and it often points to a few common culprits. Have you considered looking at the correlation between your alpha components and also performing robustness checks across different time periods or market regimes? Sometimes, even small adjustments to data cleaning or feature engineering can significantly impact stability.

---

### 评论 #20 (作者: BM18934, 时间: 3个月前)

It sounds like you're encountering a common challenge with your current alpha signals. Seeing widespread negative performance metrics can be a strong indicator that your factors might be overfitted or experiencing a regime shift. Have you considered exploring techniques like regularization, ensemble methods, or robust feature selection to improve stability?

---

### 评论 #21 (作者: BM18934, 时间: 2个月前)

It sounds like you're hitting a common challenge with alpha decay or potential overfitting across your current signals. Have you experimented with systematically adjusting lookahead periods or incorporating a rolling Sharpe ratio into your selection process to gauge stability more dynamically? Perhaps examining correlations between these signals during periods of negative performance could also reveal insights into underlying market regime shifts.

---

### 评论 #22 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 2个月前)

This is a common challenge when dealing with alpha decay or market regime shifts. Have you considered exploring different feature engineering techniques or perhaps incorporating a regime-switching component into your factor construction? Sometimes looking at a shorter lookback period for certain fundamental features can also help capture more recent market dynamics.

---

### 评论 #23 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 2个月前)

This is a common challenge when optimizing alpha combinations. Have you considered looking into correlation between your signals and potential lookahead bias in your data generation? Sometimes a slight adjustment to lookback windows or a more robust dimensionality reduction technique can help uncover stable, uncorrelated components.

---

### 评论 #24 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 2个月前)

It's tough when all your metrics are in the red! Have you considered looking at the interaction terms between your factors? Sometimes negative performance in individual components can be masked or even amplified by their interplay, and that might offer a clue to improving alpha stability.

---

### 评论 #25 (作者: HN97575, 时间: 2个月前)

It sounds like you're facing a common challenge with alpha decay or overfitting, where metrics like CSAP and CAP are all showing negative returns. Have you explored looking at your alpha's correlation to market factors or its performance across different market regimes? Sometimes a deep dive into the specific data sources or features used can reveal unexpected biases that impact these metrics.

---

### 评论 #26 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 2个月前)

It's definitely a common challenge to see all performance metrics in the red, especially across multiple alpha types like CSAP and CAP. Have you considered analyzing the correlation between these alphas or exploring potential regime shifts that might be impacting their combined performance? Sometimes, a deep dive into their individual decay curves and lookback periods can reveal surprising insights into why they're all struggling simultaneously.
