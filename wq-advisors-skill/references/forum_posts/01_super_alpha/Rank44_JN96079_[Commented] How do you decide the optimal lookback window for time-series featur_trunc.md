Choosing the right window size can dramatically affect signal quality. Do you rely on intuition, grid search, or adaptive methods to determine this?

For me, I apply all of those. Gives you better ideas, diverse alphas, and quality alpha templates!

That's a crucial question, JK98819! I've found that a combination of domain knowledge and robust cross-validation is key. Have you encountered situations where a fixed lookback period consistently underperforms, leading you to explore more adaptive or ensemble approaches for feature window selection?

I actually strictly avoid grid searching for lookback windows. If you test every integer from 5 to 60, and exactly 37 gives you the best Sharpe, it’s almost certainly overfit to a specific historical market anomaly. To minimize my degrees of freedom, I force myself to only use standard calendar buckets: 5 (weekly), 20 (monthly), 60 (quarterly), and 252 (annually). If an alpha concept doesn't work at one of those major anchor points, the core thesis is usually fundamentally weak. Do you have a strict limit on how many different windows you allow yourself to test before abandoning a draft?

This is a crucial question, JK98819! Beyond intuition and grid search, I've found exploring spectral analysis or applying cross-correlation techniques between features and target variables can often reveal more principled window lengths, especially for cyclical patterns. Have you found success with any particular adaptive methods, perhaps something like Kalman filters or dynamic window optimization based on recent performance metrics?

Great question, JK98819! I've found that a combination of domain knowledge for initial intuition and then a robust backtesting framework with cross-validation is key. Do you typically find that shorter, more adaptive windows perform better in volatile regimes, or do you see benefits in longer, smoother windows even then?

This is a crucial question for time-series alphas. Beyond simple grid search, I've found that looking at feature autocorrelation decay and applying statistical significance tests to potential window sizes can offer more robust selections. Have you encountered scenarios where the optimal window size shifts significantly based on market regime or asset class?

This is a crucial question! I often start with a domain-informed intuition (e.g., typical business cycle lengths) and then refine with a combination of cross-validation and out-of-sample testing to avoid overfitting. Have you found any specific adaptive methods that consistently outperform static grid searches for your time-series features?

This is a critical question for time-series alpha development. Beyond grid search, I've found exploring autocorrelation functions (ACF) of potential features to be a useful heuristic for identifying natural decay periods. Have others found specific ACF characteristics (e.g., the point where ACF drops below a certain threshold) to be reliable indicators for setting initial lookback windows?

### 评论 #9 (作者: DN37313, 时间: 3个月前)

Adding to the discussion on domain knowledge, I find that the optimal lookback is rarely uniform across the entire market; it depends heavily on the sector's natural information cycle. For instance, when building signals around banking stocks, a short 5-day window often just captures microstructure noise, whereas a 60-day or 90-day window aligns much better with underlying credit cycles and quarterly reporting. Have you ever experimented with dynamically routing different lookback windows to specific sub-universes, rather than forcing a single window across the whole market?

HN97575 makes an excellent point about using the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) to find natural decay periods. I've found that this decay rate varies wildly depending on the sector's natural information cycle. For instance, when analyzing banking stocks, a short 5-day window often just captures microstructure noise because their ACF drops slowly, whereas a 60-day or 90-day window aligns much better with their underlying credit cycles and quarterly reporting. Have you experimented with dynamically assigning different lookback windows to specific sub-universes based on their unique ACF profiles?

### 评论 #11 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, JK98819! I've found that a combination of domain knowledge to narrow down the initial search space and then a robust cross-validation approach, perhaps even with specific walk-forward optimization techniques, can be more efficient than a blind grid search. Have you experimented with any methods that penalize overfitting more explicitly during the window selection process?

### 评论 #12 (作者: TL72720, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, JK98819! The interplay between lookback window and signal persistence is fundamental. I've found that while grid search is a good starting point, it often misses the nuance of how regime shifts affect optimal windows. Have you explored any methods that incorporate decaying importance of older data, perhaps akin to exponential smoothing, to adapt more gracefully?

### 评论 #13 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, JK98819! For me, it's often a mix of domain knowledge to establish a reasonable initial range and then empirical testing via cross-validation or walk-forward optimization to refine. Have you found any specific types of signals that tend to benefit more from adaptive lookback windows versus fixed ones?

---

### 评论 #14 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a crucial question! I often find that a multi-faceted approach works best. While grid search provides a solid baseline, exploring adaptive methods like Kalman filters or simple moving averages with dynamic window adjustments can capture regime changes more effectively. Have you found any specific adaptive techniques particularly robust for different market conditions?

This is a crucial question for time-series alphas. Beyond simple grid search, I've found that looking at feature autocorrelation decay and applying statistical significance tests to potential window sizes can offer more robust selections. Have you encountered scenarios where the optimal window size shifts significantly based on market regime or asset class?

Before running any simulation ask what the natural timescale of the phenomenon your signal is capturing actually is. This question has a real answer grounded in market structure and human behavior that exists independently of your backtest.

Earnings information diffusion in developed markets — roughly 20-60 trading days for full incorporation depending on coverage intensity. Institutional rebalancing cycles — monthly or quarterly cadences suggesting 20 or 60 day windows. Analyst revision clustering — typically 5-15 days around earnings events. Short-term price momentum — documented at 3-12 month horizons suggesting 60-250 day windows. Mean reversion after overreaction — typically 5-20 days for short-term and 3-5 years for long-term value reversion.

Starting from these economically motivated ranges rather than an unconstrained search dramatically reduces the overfitting risk from window selection while keeping you anchored to genuine market phenomena.
