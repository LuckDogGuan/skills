Hey, to reduce correlation, try framing your strategies using different operators or working with different data fields that share a similar concept but belong to different categories. You can also explore alternative neutralization techniques. If you’ve already submitted an idea, consider working on a different neutralization approach.

Production correlation primarily indicates whether the idea you’ve submitted is correlated with those of other consultants. Reviewing the correlation chart can provide valuable insights. For instance, if you notice that not many consultants have submitted alphas with correlations above 0.7, your idea can likely be improved to make it submittable.

[PT88153](/hc/en-us/profiles/20369380952343-PT88153)  i think trying the less explored datafields is one way , you can try making alphas in the single country regions there also you get fairly low prod correlation , even in GLB region prod correlation is less . Try using operators that find the relation between data like ts_corr , ts_covariance and others . You can try doing custom neutralizations using group_coalesce operator .

I believe these would be enough to reduce prod correlation while maintaining performance .

Hi  [PT88153](/hc/en-us/profiles/20369380952343-PT88153) ,

Based on my experience, reducing the prod corr of superalphas can be effectively achieved using the following methods:

1. **Refining Alpha Selection and Smoothing**
   - **Approach** : Experiment with selection expressions and smooth alpha selection using operators like  `ts_mean()`  or set conditions for alpha rotation and regular updates.
   - **Example** : Select the best-performing alphas based on a 10-day rolling performance and update the alpha list every two weeks to lower production correlation.
2. **Using Combination Expressions**
   - **Approach** : Utilize additional alpha statistics beyond returns, such as  `ts_kurtosis()`  for tail behavior or  `ts_mean()`  for trend averaging, and combine these with cross-sectional operators like  `hump`  to reduce turnover.
   - **Example** : Combine  `ts_kurtosis(returns, 5)`  with  `ts_mean(price, 10)`  to create stable expressions that reduce prod corr while maintaining effectiveness.
3. **Adjusting Days and Neutralization Settings**
   - **Approach** : Experiment with time horizons and optimal decay settings (less than 6) to balance predictive power and reduce correlation.
   - **Example** : Use a 3-day decay window and sector-neutralize signals to maintain consistency across market variations.

These methods often deliver strong results when tailored to specific data.

Here’s my experience with improving regular alpha development:

1. **Using Different Data Fields**
   - **Approach** : Experiment with equivalent data fields like “high,” “low,” or “open” instead of “close.”
   - **Example** : Replace  `ts_mean(close, 5)`  with  `ts_mean(open, 5)`  to explore alternative signal dynamics.
2. **Exploring Different Operators**
   - **Approach** : Start with similar operators and build a library of substitutions that can reduce max correlation.
   - **Example** : Use  `ts_median()`  instead of  `ts_mean()`  or  `zscore()`  instead of  `rank()`  for comparable results with lower correlation.
3. **Adjusting Groupings and Neutralizations**
   - **Approach** : Leverage meaningful groupings or neutralizations rather than creating arbitrary ones.
   - **Example** : Group data by sector or region to uncover unique insights without compromising signal validity.
4. **Thinking Outside the Box**
   - **Approach** : Conduct genuine research and explore unconventional ideas to develop unique alphas.
   - **Example** : Combine unconventional data sources, such as sentiment indices or alternative datasets, with traditional price data.

These strategies not only reduce max correlation but also foster innovative alpha creation.

Try using different operators or working with distinct data fields that share a similar concept but belong to different categories to reduce correlation,. You can also explore alternative neutralization methods. If you've already submitted an idea, consider trying a different neutralization approach. Production correlation indicates how your idea compares to others.

### 评论 #9 (作者: NH84459, 时间: 1年前)

Using different mathematical operators (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) or logical operators (AND, OR, XOR) can change how signals are combined, leading to strategies that behave differently under similar conditions.

@PT88153  I think selecting the median-performing alphas for submission is the most effective method for reducing production correlation. Almost the highest-performing alphas are facing extremely high production correlation.

Furthermore, while risk neutralization was effective in reducing production correlation a few months ago, it is currently not showing the same level of effectiveness.

### 评论 #11 (作者: HS48991, 时间: 1年前)

Exploring less common data fields can be a good approach. You could try building alphas in single-country regions, which often show lower production correlation. Using operators like  `ts_corr`  and  `ts_covariance`  to find relationships in the data can also help. Additionally, applying custom neutralizations with the  `group_coalesce`  operator might be effective. These steps should help reduce production correlation while keeping performance strong.

If you have a good alpha that can be submitted but only has a little bit of prod correlation (for example, the prod correlation of the alpha you are going to submit is 0.71 -> 0.73), you can quickly try some ways such as: try changing the universe, try changing the neutralization, using the ts_decay_linear operator, ...

If your alpha is stuck with a heavy prod correlation, you should change to a new alpha idea because your alpha idea has been used too much

1.Try using different operators under the same category type like ts_quantile,ts_zscore,ts_scale,ts_rank

2.Try using same alpha in less explored regions like China,GLB,Taiwan etc.

3.Try using different neutralization settings

4.If you are using group_cartesian_product,try different grouping category.

To reduce production correlation in regular alphas:

1. **Diversify Signals:**  Use different data sources, timeframes, and uncorrelated features.
2. **Orthogonalization:**  Apply  `group_vector_proj` , PCA, or de-correlation techniques.
3. **Vary Methods:**  Use different transformations, nonlinear models, and adaptive elements.
4. **Dynamic Weights:**  Adjust weights to reduce reliance on correlated alphas.
5. **Monitor Regularly:**  Track correlation matrices and address overlaps in live production.

Focus on diversification, robust testing, and iterative refinement to maintain low correlation.

我是技術宅，看到這個帖子我想分享一下我的經驗，減少生產相關性（production correlation）是 alpha 開發中的重要一步。根據我的經驗，可以嘗試以下方法：

1. 使用不同的數據欄位：嘗試使用不同的數據欄位，例如「high」、「low」或「open」 вместо 「close」。

2. 探索不同的運算子：使用不同的運算子，例如 ts_median() 或 ts_zscore() 來替代 ts_mean()。

3. 調整分組和中性化設定：使用有意義的分組和中性化設定，例如按照行業或地區進行分組。

4. 嘗試不同的方法：使用不同的轉換、非線性模型和適應性元素來減少相關性。

另外，也可以嘗試使用 KS69567 提到的方法，例如多樣化信號、正交化、改變方法、動態權重和定期監控相關性矩陣。這些方法可以幫助您減少 alpha 之間的相關性，從而提高整體的表現。

### To Reduce Correlation:

1. **Use Distinct Operators** : Frame your strategies with different operators to minimize overlap with others.
2. **Diversify Data Fields** : Work with data fields that share a concept but belong to unrelated categories.
3. **Explore Neutralization Techniques** : Experiment with alternative methods to neutralize correlation effectively.
4. **Revisit Submitted Ideas** : If you've already submitted an idea, try applying a new neutralization approach to improve it.

### Understanding Production Correlation:

1. **Check the Correlation Chart** : Analyze the chart to identify common trends and avoid overlapping with highly correlated alphas.
2. **Aim for Unique Ideas** : If most submissions avoid correlations above 0.7, adjust your idea to lower its correlation.
3. **Refine for Acceptance** : Use insights from the chart to enhance your submission's viability.

Reducing production correlation is key to creating diversified and effective alphas. Some best practices include using different operators like  `ts_rank` ,  `ts_zscore` , or  `ts_scale`  within the same category, exploring less-crowded regions (e.g., GLB or ASI), experimenting with niche neutralizations, and incorporating alternative data sources. Additionally, combining factors like momentum and value can help reduce overlap. A robust backtesting process across different universes is also essential. Hope this helps!

Hi, These steps can help reduce production correlation while maintaining strong performance:

- **Explore less exploited markets** : Focus on under-researched markets like HKG, KOR, JPN, and TWN, as they often offer opportunities for alphas with lower correlations.
- **Diversify your set of operators** : Instead of relying on a few common operators, consider using a broader range of options to enhance the variety and effectiveness of your alphas.

Hi,

To reduce correlation in your alpha strategies, use different operators and data fields to avoid overlap with other ideas. Try mixing data from unrelated categories and experiment with neutralization methods to minimize correlation. If you've already submitted an idea, try applying a new neutralization approach to improve it.

To refine your strategies, check the correlation chart to spot trends and avoid highly correlated alphas. If many ideas have a correlation above 0.7, adjust yours to lower it. This will make your idea more unique and improve its chances of acceptance.

It’s great that you’re looking into production correlation! One effective strategy is diversification across various markets or assets. This can mitigate risk and improve alpha stability. Additionally, it might be worth examining your models for any dependencies that could be causing high correlation. I’d be curious to hear how you currently assess this in your alphas!

### 评论 #30 (作者: ML46209, 时间: 1年前)

To lower production correlation, target less crowded markets, diversify operators, implement risk neutralization, and select niche datasets to create more distinctive alphas.
