Hi everyone, do you weight/assign weights to the alpha delay 0 signals for each region, or do you allocate equal weights to the alpha delay 1 signals? Currently, I'm equally weighting the 5 alphas with the highest Sharpe ratios in each region.

Interesting approach to weighting! I'm curious if you've experimented with different weighting schemes beyond equal weighting, perhaps considering the historical decay or correlation between alphas within a region? Also, how do you define "highest Sharpe ratios" – is it ex-ante or a rolling metric?

### 评论 #2 (作者: NL65170, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi NM12321, that's an interesting approach to alpha weighting. I've found that considering alpha decay rates can significantly impact performance; have you experimented with dynamic weighting schemes that adjust based on observed decay, rather than fixed delay assignments? Also, are you seeing a strong correlation between Sharpe ratio and optimal weight across your regions, or are other metrics like information ratio or alpha correlation playing a more dominant role in your weighting decisions?

### 评论 #8 (作者: TP85668, 时间: 4个月前)

Interesting strategy, NM12321! I'm curious about your rationale for the regional weighting – are you observing significant alpha divergence across regions, or is it more about portfolio diversification? I've found that sometimes incorporating a slight negative correlation between regional alphas can be more beneficial than just aiming for the highest Sharpe, even if it means a marginal reduction in individual alpha Sharpe.
