**Systematic Data Handling**

An alpha’s performance heavily relies on the datafields it uses. Nan value and extreme outliers can especially alter the desirable alpha weight, and can affect alpha performance in the OS period, where the performance is unknown. Here, we will introduce different techniques for data handling to incorporate into your Alpha Creation Engine (ACE).

- **Data characteristics:**

Determining the right data handling method requires some insights from the data -- like what the data range is, how frequent the data is updated, etc. There are some techniques to do so on BRAIN by simulating expressions with “None” neutralization, decay 0 & truncation 0 setting and then checking the Visualization option.

1. Data type:

In general, the BRAIN platform provides three types of datafields, which are group, matrix, and vector. The datafields of group and matrix don’t need any pre-processing before usage; but the vector datafields will need to be processed through a vector aggregate operator to be used. You can check the meaning and how to use them on  [Vector Operator](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/data-and-operators/operators#vector-operators) .

1. Coverage & updated frequency:

The overall coverage for a particular datafield can be retrieved through the data explorer feature or on the dataset page. But a deeper insight can help determine the correct backfilling method.

Expression

Insight

datafield

The “Coverage of Universe” tab will show the how coverage of the datafield changes through the backtest period.

The “Turnover” tab will show the updated frequency of the datafield, where the extreme jump in the chart means the instruments’ value is changes (or there are a sudden drop in coverage). But the updated frequency is cyclical in nature so observing the “Turnover” will give some insights on the updated period.

datafield != 0 ? 1 : 0

The “Coverage of Universe” or the long count will show the number of non zero values

1. Data range & mean:

Data range can be determined by assumption from the description of the datafield. If the description of the datafield is some “normalized” value then there is a high chance that the data is in the range [0, 1] or if it is about the capitalization then the value is in the range of [0, 3* 10­11] (max value is the current highest market cap company in the USA market)

Expression

Insight

abs(datafield) > X

Check the long count or “Coverage of Universe” tab and vary the values of X based on the assumptions from descriptions of the datafield

ts_mean(datafield, 1000) > X

Mean of the datafield over 5 years. One can find the values of X by using binary search and see when the Long Count value approach the true coverage number of the datafield.

- **Data Backfilling:**

BRAIN also provides various operators to help deal with undesirable value like NAN.

1. Time series approach:

From the determined updated frequency above, you can choose the correct lookback day to backfill the data.

Expression

Usage

ts_backfill(x, d, k)

Replace the NAN value with k-th closest non-NAN value. k is the k-th value that we will use to backfill. For example k=1, mean we will use the first non-NAN value.

kth_element(x, d, k, ignore)

This operator has the same usage as ts_backfill with a more flexible approach where you can define what value you want to replace using ignore parameter.

1. Group approach:

Sometimes because of the nature of the datafield, some instruments do not have non-NAN values or have very few non-NAN values throughout the backtest period; for example, datafields about stock dividends, not every company issues a dividend payout for their respective stock, especially high growth companies where all earnings tend to be reinvested into the business to drive further development and innovation. So, a good way to increase the coverage is to backfill based on the values of other companies that are in the same industry or have the same product.

Expression

Usage

group_backfill(x, group, d, std)

Backfill by the winsorized mean (determined by std value) of all non-NAN values in the group over last d days.

group_extra(x, weight, group)

Backfill by the group means.

group_coalesce(original_group, group2,…)

Regroup stocks based on group2 if original_group does not cover all stocks in the universe. It is often used for ILLIQUID universe, where some grouping fields may lack coverage.

1. Arithmetic approach:

Another way to increase a datafield’s coverage is using predefined value. For example, if the datafield is news sentiment of stocks, if the value is NAN for a particular day for a stock, you can set the value to be neutral sentiment for that stock.

Expression

Usage

replace(x, target, dest)

The operator replace the target values with the dest values (N target -> N dest, 1->1, N->1)

- **Data Outliers Handling:**

1. Winsorization

The winsorize operation removes outliers by making assumptions that the data is normally distributed, and it tries to remove data points that exceed the limits determined by the number of standard deviations from the mean of the data. It works best with normalized data.

Expression

Usage

winsorize(x, std=4)

Winsorize x by the lower and upper limits specified as multiple of std.

1. Truncation

The truncate operator applies truncation separately for the positive and negative part of the alpha vector, which will help limit the extreme data points by replacing positive values which are too big or negative values which are too small by value in the threshold.

Expression

Usage

truncate(x, maxPercent=0.01)

This operator truncates all values of x to maxPercent of sum of values.

1. Data Smoothing:

For time series analysis, data smoothing is a great way to remove noise and outliers. There are different type of smoothing that include moving average and exponential smoothing. It is great to observe the changes in the data with low updated frequency or reduce volatility from high updated frequency data.

Expression

Usage

ts_decay_linear(x, d)

Apply linear decay on the datafield

ts_decay_exp_window(x, d, factor)

Apply exponential decay on the datafield

1. Data Handling Flow for ACE:

Data handling can be fully automated with a decision layer using the data characteristic. But a general approach that quantitative researchers take before they start making an alpha with a dataset, they spend time analyzing and achieving a better understanding of the underlying dataset, its statistics and the context of each datafields and their descriptions within, which will greatly help in building a good template for that dataset or even generating insights.

**Winsorization**  is a statistical technique used to  **handle outliers**  in a dataset by capping or trimming extreme values. Instead of completely removing outliers, Winsorization  **limits**  the data points that lie outside a specific threshold to a predefined value, often determined by the  **mean**  and  **standard deviation**  of the dataset. This method assumes that the data follows a  **normal distribution** , making it particularly effective for datasets that are approximately normal or have been normalized.

Before applying any data handling technique, it is crucial to gain insights into the data. Consider:

- **Range of Data:**  Understand the min and max values of your data fields. This helps in identifying outliers and understanding the distribution.
- **Frequency of Updates:**  Determine how often the data is updated. This can affect the choice of handling missing values (e.g., interpolation methods vs. filling with historical data).
- **Data Type:**  Numeric vs. categorical data requires different methods of handling.

When it comes to the 'input' for functions like  `reduce_avg` , you're typically looking at your alpha signals or financial data points. If you're running into errors with vectors or matrices, it might be that your data isn't formatted correctly or there's a mismatch in dimensions. Understanding your data's characteristics is crucial before you start tweaking it. Whether it's the range, update frequency, or type, getting a clear picture of what you're working with is half the battle won. BRAIN's tools can help you simulate and visualize this data, which is a great starting point. For backfilling and handling outliers, you've got a toolkit that's pretty robust. Whether it's time series backfilling with  `ts_backfill`  or group-based methods like  `group_backfill` , these operators can help you clean up your data and maintain coverage.
