## 帖子正文

Hello quants. I have been trying to come up with alphas, but for some reason, they mostly perform poorly in the  **Out of Sample** . I have recently tried to dig deeper into research on how I can improve my  **combined alpha performance** , which has lately been deteriorating. I came across a post that I should consider my turnover levels by using operators that manage turnover such as the  *hump*  or  *ts_target_tvr_delta_limit*  and  *trade when*  operators.I have tried using them, but they just reduce the  **turnover**  but do not cut off the spikes in the turnover. This is one of the outcomes of the same. I don't know if it is a good idea to submit such alphas.  **More ideas**  are welcome on how to improve the combined alpha performance

I have the same question as you, if turnover < 5% is it good?

It’s great that you're focusing on improving  **out-of-sample (OS) performance**  and  **controlling turnover spikes** ! Here are a few key strategies to enhance your combined alpha performance:

✅  **Turnover Stabilization:**

- Instead of just reducing turnover,  **optimize signal decay rates**  (e.g.,  **exponential smoothing**  or  `ts_decay` ).
- Use  **rolling z-scores**  to smooth signals before applying turnover constraints.
- Consider  **vector projection methods**  to reduce  **unwanted turnover spikes**  caused by noise.

✅  **Improving OS Robustness:**

- Test for  **autocorrelation**  in your alpha—strong mean-reverting behavior can indicate  **overfitting** .
- **Diversify**  signal construction (e.g., mix  **price-based + fundamental-based alphas** ).
- **Rank neutralization**  across sectors/sub-industries to avoid excessive dependence on a single factor.

🔹  **Conclusion:**  Submitting  **low-turnover alphas is good** , but stability matters too! Try  **adaptive decay techniques and hybrid signal integration**  for better OOS consistency. 🚀

The OS ratio will be good when your strategy is effective. You should consider all metrics over the years, analyze and evaluate them comprehensively instead of focusing only on turnover. Apply tests to check whether the alpha is overfitted or not.

It's great to see your focus on improving out-of-sample (OS) performance and controlling turnover spikes! Here are key strategies to enhance combined alpha performance:

**Turnover Stabilization**

- Optimize signal decay (e.g., exponential smoothing, ts_decay).
- Use rolling z-scores to smooth signals before applying turnover constraints.
- Apply vector projection methods to reduce noise-driven turnover spikes.

**Improving OS Robustness**

- Check for autocorrelation—strong mean reversion may indicate overfitting.
- Diversify signals (e.g., combining price-based and fundamental-based alphas).
- Use rank neutralization across sectors/sub-industries to avoid single-factor dependence.

1. Improve OS Sharpe Ratio of Your Alphas

A higher OS Sharpe directly improves your combined performance.
- Avoid Overfitting: Keep alphas simple, test on different time periods, and avoid excessive parameter tuning.
- Use the Test Period Feature: Ensure alphas perform well in the test set before submission.
- Use Market-Neutral Transformations: Avoid biases that overfit to specific market regimes.
- Ensure Stability: Alphas with consistent Sharpe over time are better for combined performance.

---

2. Reduce Correlation Between Submitted Alphas

Highly correlated alphas don’t contribute much to Combined Alpha Performance.
- Check Correlation Matrices: Before submission, analyze pairwise correlation between your alphas.
- Use Diverse Factors: Instead of just price-based signals, incorporate fundamental, volume, and alternative datasets.
- Apply Different Transformations: Use variations in decay rates, time horizons, or ranking mechanisms.
- Submit Alphas from Different Pyramids: Ensuring alphas come from different sources enhances diversification.

---

3. Optimize Turnover for Better Score Impact

Turnover impacts your score directly:
- Keep Turnover < 10%: High turnover alphas tend to degrade performance.
- Use Low-Turnover Operators: Apply ts_target_tvr_hump, ts_target_tvr_delta_limit, or trade_when.
- Balance Sharpe vs. Turnover: If turnover is high, ensure Sharpe is well above 2.

---

4. Improve Risk Management and Neutralization

Some neutralizations may increase turnover and harm scores.
- Apply Selective Neutralizations: Avoid over-neutralizing factors unless necessary.
- Monitor Exposure to Unwanted Risks: Industry, sector, and macro risks should be controlled efficiently.
- Test Alpha Performance with and Without Neutralization: Sometimes, removing neutralization can improve OS performance.

---

5. Increase the Number of High-Scoring Alphas

- Submit More Alphas with Scores > 0: Your combined score depends on the total number of alphas and their scores.
- Remove Poor Performers: Regularly replace low-scoring alphas with better ones.
- Keep a Balance Between New and Old Submissions: Continuously refreshing your alpha pool ensures adaptability.

Share you some secrets about the combined performance. If you take a closer look at the leaderboard before and after the latest update, you can find that the result is very volatile, even those consultants with thousands of submitted alpha, too. What makes it even more sarcastic is that the number of combined alpha performance in OS after cost with sharpe  *>*  2 is so high, which means many consultants could get rich with their own created alphas(Some consultant only submit one alpha and get 2.x with 0 weight LMAO).
Instead of focusing on the number, you should find your researcher to accomplish your research pattern.

Reduce correlation between submitted alphas and enhance overall performance, analyze pairwise correlations using correlation matrices before submission. Incorporate diverse factors beyond price-based signals, such as fundamental, volume, and alternative data. Apply different transformations by varying decay rates, time horizons, and ranking mechanisms.

Reducing turnover is great, but have you considered adaptive turnover thresholds? For instance, using a volatility-adjusted turnover limit could help balance stability and responsiveness dynamically.

Your post raises an important issue in alpha development—ensuring robust Out-of-Sample (OOS) performance while managing turnover effectively. Using  **hump, ts_target_tvr_delta_limit, and trade_when**  operators is a great start, but if they only reduce turnover without eliminating extreme spikes, additional refinements might be necessary.

Have you considered  **smoothing techniques**  like applying a  **rolling median**  or using  **decay functions**  to gradually adjust positions? Also, do you find that your alphas with lower turnover generally perform better OOS, or is the relationship inconsistent?

It sounds like you're really diving deep into improving your alphas! Have you considered exploring different combinations of alphas or even different market conditions under which they perform best? Sometimes, testing them across varied environments can reveal interesting insights. It might also be beneficial to analyze the timeframes you're using for your data. Would be interesting to see how that impacts your overall performance!

Your strategies for enhancing alpha performance are insightful and practical. Avoiding overfitting by keeping alphas simple and testing across various time periods ensures robustness across market conditions. Reducing correlation among alphas through diverse data sources and transformation techniques enhances the overall portfolio’s performance. The focus on controlling turnover is key—keeping it under 10% while using operators like  `ts_target_tvr_hump`  helps reduce transaction costs without sacrificing alpha potential. Selective neutralization is crucial; overdoing it can harm alpha stability, so it's important to balance risk management with signal preservation. Finally, continuously refreshing your pool with high-scoring alphas and removing low performers ensures adaptability and competitiveness. The volatility in leaderboard rankings underscores the unpredictable nature of alpha generation, even for consultants with limited submissions.

Do you believe that focusing on a smaller set of consistent, high-performing alphas with low correlation is more effective than submitting numerous, high-risk alphas for short-term gains?

Improving combined alpha performance is a critical challenge, especially when dealing with turnover spikes and out-of-sample (OOS) results. Your focus on using operators to manage turnover is a solid start, but it might be worth exploring adaptive turnover thresholds that adjust based on market volatility. Additionally, have you considered the impact of combining alphas from different strategies or asset classes to enhance diversification? This could potentially stabilize performance and reduce the risk of overfitting while allowing for a more robust OOS performance.

- **Smoothing Turnover** : Instead of just slapping on turnover limits, think about smoothing the turnover over time. A rolling average or something similar can help reduce sudden spikes without messing up your trades too much. You could also reduce trade size during high volatility to keep things from getting out of hand.
- **Smooth the Alpha** : If your alphas are bouncing around too much in-sample, they’ll likely keep doing that OOS. Try smoothing them using things like exponential moving averages to avoid those wild jumps. Also, if you’re stacking alphas together, make sure they’re not too correlated. PCA might help here.
- **Focus on Risk-Adjusted Return** : Instead of just chasing alpha, maybe try focusing on risk-adjusted metrics like the Sharpe ratio or Sortino ratio. These tend to perform better in OOS because they filter out those unstable, high-risk signals.
- **Transaction Costs** : Big turnover spikes are sometimes just a sign of transaction costs or slippage. Make sure you’re accounting for these in your backtests—it’ll give you a more realistic idea of how your strategy performs in live markets.
- **Cross-Validation** : Use time-series cross-validation to check how your alphas perform over different periods. This will help spot overfitting and ensure the model isn’t just good for one particular time window.

Improving Out-of-Sample (OOS) performance and maintaining alpha stability requires a careful balance between simplicity, diversification, and turnover control. Your emphasis on avoiding overfitting by testing across multiple market conditions is crucial—alphas that perform well in only a specific timeframe often fail under real-world conditions. Reducing correlation among signals by utilizing diverse data sources, transformations, and non-overlapping features strengthens overall portfolio robustness.

Turnover remains a key concern. While operators like  `ts_target_tvr_hump`  help manage it, controlling excessive transaction costs without sacrificing returns is an ongoing challenge. Keeping turnover below 10% is a reasonable threshold, but additional smoothing techniques like low-pass filters or adaptive constraints could further enhance stability.

Additionally, the selective neutralization of exposures should be done cautiously—over-neutralization can dilute strong alpha signals and reduce overall effectiveness. A better approach is to identify critical risk factors that should be neutralized while preserving valuable predictive power.

A dynamic refreshing mechanism for alphas—removing underperformers while retaining high-quality signals—ensures adaptability in an ever-changing market. Given the volatility in alpha rankings, a question remains: Is it better to focus on a smaller, well-tested set of high-performing alphas with low correlation, or to continuously explore new high-risk alphas for short-term gains?

Although controlling turnover is crucial, have you thought about adding stability restrictions or modifying the rolling window?  Volatility scaling and EMA are two smoothing methods that could help manage those turnover spikes!
