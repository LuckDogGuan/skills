## 帖子正文

What unconventional or alternative datasets have you found consistently improve out-of-sample performance when combined with fundamentals and model-driven data, and how do you typically normalize or integrate them to avoid overfitting or regime-specific noise?

For me, stronger OS often comes from  *how*  you process data rather than just which dataset you pick. Some data like model fields can overfit easily, while fundamentals sometimes hold steadier OS. Still exploring—open to any tips!

I believe  **option datasets**  and  **price volumes**  can help in this case. They have proven to help keep PnL steady, and therefore you can predict easily.

Interesting question! I’ve found that alternative datasets like supply chain linkages, insider trading patterns, or even sector-specific sentiment (e.g., earnings call transcripts) can add real value when combined with fundamentals. The key is to normalize them cross-sectionally and test stability across regimes—otherwise they risk being just noise. Regularization or simple rank transforms usually help keep the signal robust out of sample.

Guys, many high-volume datasets are showing a  **steady decline in OS performance** . You’ll need to combine new methods or turn to less popular datasets to keep your signals strong. (jzc

Great question! In my experience, alternative datasets like supply-chain signals, option-implied metrics, or sentiment/news analytics often add unique value. Normalization with rank/z-score and orthogonalization against core fundamentals helps reduce overlap and avoid regime-specific noise. Curious what others have found effective.

Excellent question! From my experience, alternative datasets—such as supply-chain indicators, option-implied metrics, or sentiment/news data—can provide meaningful incremental signals. Applying normalization (rank or z-score) and orthogonalizing against core fundamentals helps minimize overlap and mitigate regime-specific noise. I’d love to hear what approaches others have found successful.

In my experience, stronger  **out-of-sample (OS) performance**  often depends more on  *how*  the data is processed rather than simply on the dataset chosen. The way you clean, transform, and structure features can have a bigger impact on robustness than just sourcing a new signal. Certain data types, such as model-derived fields, can be prone to overfitting and may look impressive in-sample but degrade quickly OS. On the other hand, fundamentals often provide more stable signals that generalize better, though they may require creative transformations to extract their full value. I’m still experimenting and would love to hear how others approach balancing data selection with processing for stronger OS performance.

Alternative datasets that often add real out-of-sample value include sentiment and news flow, supply chain or shipping data, and even web traffic or app usage metrics, since they capture behavior fundamentals can’t. Some also use options-implied volatility or short interest as forward-looking risk indicators. To integrate them effectively, most normalize with rank or zscore to reduce scale effects, then test across multiple lags or decay horizons to avoid regime dependence. It also helps to neutralize against standard risk factors (size, sector, beta) so the signal isn’t just rediscovering known exposures.
