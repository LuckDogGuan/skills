I tried to increase my Sharpe, but only can increase it if I sum 2 alphas. I know it's not good but don't know other way. Anyone have tip for me?

Instead of just summing alphas, you could try these approaches:

- **Focus on the Idea** : Make sure each alpha has a solid, logical foundation and isn’t just tuned to fit past data.
- **Use Robust Operators** : Apply operators like  `rank`  or  `ts_rank`  to normalize and stabilize signals, which often improves Sharpe without overfitting.
- **Moderate to High Turnover Datasets** : Test your alphas on datasets with moderate to high turnover to ensure they are effective in dynamic environments.

Personally, I’ve seen success by focusing on good ideas signals and refining them on high-turnover datasets. Curious to know if others have explored similar techniques!

Have you tried multiple it with other, or use if/else condition?

I thought only linear combination is not good, we can try non-linear. With me, I always tried if/else with multiple conditions, such as price/volumne, or with high/low cap/liquidity

@TT10055 Can you share how to use combine by non-linear alpha example? I try something such as -ts_delta(close,5)*rank(cap) but it look like overfitting than logic combination.

To achieve a better Sharpe ratio, use the Time Series Operators with shorter lookback periods, such as quarterly, monthly, or weekly (e.g., 60, 20, or 5 days), as they tend to yield better Sharpe ratios compared to longer lookback periods like yearly (250 days).

In my experience, when you have an alpha with a Sharpe index that is close to the threshold for submission, instead of using the addition operator, you can use additional methods such as adjusting the decay setting, trying different neutralizations, or using the rank operator to re-normalize the data.

Hi  [HN80189](/hc/en-us/profiles/8780130996119-HN80189) !

I'd suggest that sometimes it might be a good idea to sum two alphas, especially if they are from the same dataset. However, when doing this, first group_neutralize and then scale each of your alphas. This way, you ensure equal contribution from each.

Change the lookback period settings to simpler values like 20,60,252. You can also alter the decay settings. Use different time series operators like rank operator instead of quantile operator

- Combine them using a  **weighted average**  based on their individual Sharpe ratios and correlation.
- Apply  **volatility scaling**  to smooth out the combined signal.
- Validate the combined alpha on  **out-of-sample data**  to ensure robustness.

Improving Sharpe without simply adding more alphas might involve balancing return and risk more effectively, rather than just increasing return. If you're able to combine these strategies, you'll likely see a more robust and sustainable Sharpe ratio improvement.

### 评论 #12 (作者: TL60820, 时间: 1年前)

Combining alphas can sometimes improve the Sharpe ratio, but it’s essential to ensure that the alphas are not highly correlated and that their combination is meaningful. You can try some techniques like double neutralization or neutralizing against specific risk factors can help refine the resulting strategy. These methods ensure that the combined alpha is less exposed to noise or systematic biases.

Hi  [HN80189](/hc/en-us/profiles/8780130996119-HN80189) , According to my experience, you should have a specific idea and from that idea you find signals that support your sharpe increase process so you won't overfit. Good luck!

Hi everyone, yesterday I read this article and was quite interested in applying it to alpha but it doesn't seem to be very effective. Does anyone have an example of an alpha demo to make it easier to visualize?

### 评论 #18 (作者: AK52014, 时间: 1年前)

Combining alphas can enhance the Sharpe ratio if they’re not highly correlated and meaningfully integrated. Techniques like double neutralization or neutralizing against specific risk factors can refine the strategy, reducing exposure to noise and systematic biases for a more robust and effective alpha combination.

### 评论 #19 (作者: RB20756, 时间: 1年前)

To improve your Sharpe ratio sustainably, instead of just combining alphas, focus on diversifying your signals. Experiment with alternative operators like  `rank`  to re-normalize data, and consider adjusting decay settings or testing different neutralization techniques. Using shorter lookback periods, such as quarterly or monthly, can also be effective for fine-tuning your strategy. Exploring less correlated features and continuously experimenting will help you refine and optimize your approach over time. Keep testing and iterating to find the best combination for consistent performance.

To boost Sharpe:

- Focus on  **better returns**  through stronger predictions and diverse signals.
- Reduce  **volatility**  via neutralization, diversification, and scaling.
- Test thoroughly to avoid overfitting.

If your alpha uses momentum based on price movements, you can:

1. Add volume data to refine the prediction of strong momentum.
2. Neutralize exposure to market-wide trends, such as hedging against the S&P 500.
3. Test the alpha on new regions or asset classes to increase diversity.
4. Apply volatility scaling to smooth performance during volatile periods.

Combining alphas can sometimes be effective, but it’s important to ensure their relationship adds genuine value rather than overfitting the data. Here are a few tips to refine your approach:

1. **Diversify Alphas** : Make sure the alphas you're summing target different market dynamics (e.g., one alpha might focus on momentum and the other on mean reversion). Combining similar alphas might inflate your Sharpe in-sample but fail out-of-sample.
2. **Normalization** : Before summing, normalize each alpha to avoid dominance by one with a larger magnitude. This ensures each alpha contributes fairly to the combined signal.
3. **Regularization** : Try penalizing over-complexity or extreme values in your combined alpha to reduce overfitting. L1 or L2 regularization can help.
4. **Backtest Robustness** : Test the combined alpha across various market conditions to confirm it generalizes well. Use rolling windows and walk-forward testing for better insights.

While simply summing two alphas might provide a temporary boost, it's not a sustainable approach and may not hold up under rigorous testing. You can try the following ways:

- **Signal Smoothing** : Apply smoothing techniques like moving averages or exponential smoothing to reduce noise in your alphas. This can help in stabilizing the performance and improving the Sharpe ratio.
- **Non-linear Transformations** : Experiment with non-linear transformations such as logarithmic ( `log(alpha + 1)` ) or exponential ( `exp(alpha)` ) transformations to enhance the strength of extreme signals.

To improve your Sharpe ratio sustainably, instead of just combining alphas, focus on diversifying your signals. Experiment with alternative operators like "Rank_by_side" to re-normalize data, and consider adjusting decay settings or testing different neutralization techniques. Using shorter lookback periods, such as quarterly or monthly, can also be effective for fine-tuning your strategy. Exploring less correlated features and continuously experimenting will help you refine and optimize your approach over time.

To improve Sharpe, aim for stronger returns through accurate predictions and diverse signals while reducing volatility with neutralization, diversification, and scaling. Focus on experimenting with uncorrelated features, alternative operators, and varying decay values. Test thoroughly to prevent overfitting and continuously refine your approach for sustainable performance.

Hi  [HN80189](/hc/en-us/profiles/8780130996119-HN80189) !

Here are some quick tips to improve sharpe:  [https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/articles/20251383456663-How-to-improve-Sharpe](https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/articles/20251383456663-How-to-improve-Sharpe)

Rather than combining alphas, think deeper about how you can change the implementation of your hypothesis: Could your alpha be expressed in a different way? Would it work better in a different region, universe or neutralization setting?

Finally, perhaps you could see sharpe as a selection criteria for alpha ideas, rather than a test you need to pass. If the sharpe of an alpha is below a certain threshold, then perhaps it is not worth further effort to improve it, and it may be better to move on to the next alpha idea.

Merging multiple alphas can be a great way to boost the Sharpe ratio, but it’s crucial to check that they aren’t too correlated and that their combination adds real value. One approach is to apply double neutralization or neutralize against key risk factors to fine-tune the strategy. This helps reduce exposure to unwanted noise and systematic biases, making the combined alpha more stable. Have you experimented with weighting alphas dynamically based on their recent performance? It could further optimize returns.

---

### 评论 #31 (作者: PY62071, 时间: 1年前)

From my experience, it’s crucial to start with a clear idea and then identify signals that enhance Sharpe without forcing adjustments. If your alpha’s Sharpe index is borderline for submission, rather than simply adding another factor, consider refining decay parameters, experimenting with different neutralization strategies, or using ranking to standardize the data.In some cases, merging two alphas can be beneficial, particularly when they originate from the same dataset. However, before combining them, ensure proper group neutralization and apply scaling so that each contributes equally.

Wishing you success in optimizing your strategy!

### 评论 #32 (作者: WN96463, 时间: 1年前)

stronger predictive signals can be achieved by using refined features, better transformations such as industry- or sector-neutral Z-scores, and combining multiple weak alphas into ensemble models. Signal stability is crucial, so applying smoothing techniques like exponential moving averages and verifying stationarity across market regimes helps reduce noise and avoid overfitting.

Use multiple orthogonal features: Combine signals from different categories—momentum, mean reversion, value, quality, volatility, etc.—to capture more persistent alpha.

提升夏普的核心是 **用样本外数据和严谨流程验证新因子的稳健性，而非复杂化模型** 。关键步骤：

1. **挖掘新阿尔法源** ：寻找逻辑独立、低相关性的新信号。
2. **严格样本外测试** ：立即将新数据隔离，用于最终验证，绝不参与训练。
3. **简化模型** ：优先使用简单、正则化的模型，降低过拟合风险。
4. **组合优化** ：将新信号与现有组合整合，优化权重，分散风险。

本质：用 **稳健性（Robustness）**  换取 **夏普比率（Sharpe Ratio）**  的提升，而非数据挖掘的深度。

### 评论 #35 (作者: YQ51506, 时间: 8个月前)

看到你说通过简单叠加两个alpha因子来提高夏普比率，这确实是个常见的尝试。不过大佬，这种直接相加的方法很容易导致过拟合，特别是在样本内测试时表现良好，但在样本外可能失效。我在WorldQuant Brain平台上做回测时，通常会用算子组合来构建更稳健的因子，比如用rank、delay或者correlation这类operator来避免简单的线性叠加。建议可以试试因子正交化或者用IC衰减来评估因子的独立性，这样可能更可持续地提升夏普。另外，回测中要注意设置合理的样本内外测试周期，避免过度优化参数。

### 评论 #38 (作者: HA37025, 时间: 6个月前)

That’s a common situation, so you’re not alone. Summing two alphas improves Sharpe mainly through diversification, which is valid, but it’s usually worth understanding  *why*  each alpha works on its own. You might try improving stability within a single signal first—by reducing noise, adjusting lookback horizons, or tightening neutralization and turnover controls. Often, small refinements to inputs or operators can lift Sharpe without relying on simple alpha addition.

Increase Sharpe by improving signal quality and robustness here are the practical ways without overfitting- Simplify the alpha try using fewer operators and parameters. Use longer lookbacks because short windows overfit noise. Neutralize properly by using the likes of sector, industry. Reduce turnover by lowering turnover usually improve Sharpe net of costs.

---

### 评论 #41 (作者: EK77046, 时间: 4个月前)

To understand what Sharpe is, you have to know what the information ratio (IR) is. This means there's no single way to increase Sharpe; it depends on several metrics of alpha, such as returns and volatility. In terms of returns, you increase Sharpe by making sure that turnover and returns are interdependent on each other. At the same time, volatility looks at what settings under the universe and grouping operators are you using, which requires one to test the best group operator that gives a good signal from the data field you are using, which must have a high coverage percentage.

### 评论 #42 (作者: MK79008, 时间: 3个月前)

Improving Sharpe by increasing the decay value upto a certain level is recommended. Sharpe ratio with 2% value is the best

---

### 评论 #43 (作者: DG92494, 时间: 3个月前)

The most workable way on my side, I use datafields with high coverage and combine them with operators such as ts_rank and group operators. Again, I must check the rationing between all the metrix that define a good alpha where all of them must have a reasonable ratio. I also check on the best setting from the given settings and finally appropriate lookback days must be identified.

### 评论 #44 (作者: ZZ12865, 时间: 2个月前)

Use robust economic rationale and parsimonious model complexity to constrain degrees of freedom rather than chasing spurious patterns in noise. Validate performance through rigorous out-of-sample testing, walk-forward analysis, and cross-validation across multiple independent time periods and market regimes. Incorporate realistic transaction costs and market impact adjustments to ensure that any Sharpe improvement stems from genuine alpha rather than curve-fitted illusions.
