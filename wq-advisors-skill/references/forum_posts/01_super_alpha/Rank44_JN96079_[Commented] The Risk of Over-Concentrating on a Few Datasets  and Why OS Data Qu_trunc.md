## **What Happened**

In the latest data update, I got hit for the first time: 73 of my Regular Alphas were decommissioned. From what I can tell, almost all of them involved oth455 (matrix) and mdl244 (vector) fields, mainly across USA, EUR, and TWN. What makes this more painful is that many of these alphas were actually performing well.

If any of your Super Alphas unknowingly selected these decommissioned fields, you may need to re-simulate, otherwise you won’t be able to submit those results.

We all know alphas fall into two styles: those that use  `ts_backfill()`  and those that don’t. Regardless of style, one reality doesn’t change: during the OS phase, data suppliers can introduce more complete data, change coverage, or revise the underlying history. Any of these shifts can materially affect alpha performance — sometimes positively, sometimes negatively. This is exactly why OS data quality is not something we can “control” or optimize our way around.

So beyond simply avoiding decommissioned fields, data quality itself is a key reason diversification matters. Overloading a portfolio on a small set of datasets can quietly build a single point of failure: when those datasets change, your alpha stack can move together — and the impact can be large.

## **What I’m doing next**

In total, I have 1,400+ submitted alphas, and this event wiped out roughly 4–5% of them. Toward year-end, I’ll reinforce my USA and EUR pipeline by expanding and rebalancing structure across fnd / mdl / oth datasets, with the goal of offsetting any potential negative impact from this update.  *(JZC)*

Hey  [JC84638](/hc/en-us/profiles/28348489344151-JC84638) , do you use AI to create templates for you? If so, can you share a way to use it?

I'd be glad to hear from you. Thank you!

[JC84638](/hc/en-us/profiles/28348489344151-JC84638)  An incredible question,

This is exactly the kind of thinking that separates signal engineering from simple factor replication.

Most people just combine signals mechanically, but Jerry is clearly thinking about information transformation and alpha architecture.

Really impressive perspective. (nok
