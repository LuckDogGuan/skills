Here are tips that may help you improve the returns of your alphas:

1.Higher turnover can boost returns  *if*  your signal is genuinely short-term.

2.Decay controls how quickly recent values are favored.

**Low decay = emphasizes the latest data point** 
Useful for short-horizon predictive features like:

3.Work on more liquid (smaller) universes in the alpha settings.

4.If your alpha has stable behavior but low variance, nudging the volatility can amplify returns.

A few tweaks can help lift your alpha returns: higher turnover if your signal is truly short-term, using decay to favor the most recent information, focusing on more liquid universes, and lightly boosting volatility when the signal is stable but low variance. Small structural adjustments often make a big difference.

Great tips! Focusing on turnover, decay tuning, liquidity filters, and volatility scaling can significantly sharpen alpha performance. Very useful!

Thank you for sharing, well I think decay and turnover are the main determining factors

Thanks for sharing! Ways to improve alpha returns include  **higher turnover**  for truly short-term signals, adjusting  **decay**  to emphasize recent data, choosing  **smaller or more liquid universes** , and if the alpha is stable but low variance,  **nudging volatility**  to amplify returns.

Thanks for sharing! Ways to boost alpha returns include increasing turnover for genuinely short-term signals, adjusting decay to give more weight to recent information, selecting smaller or more liquid universes, and, when a signal is stable but exhibits low variance, slightly increasing its volatility to enhance return potential.

Improving the returns of an alpha mostly comes down to understanding how your signal behaves over time and how quickly it reacts to new information. If your signal works well on short term movements, increasing turnover can help because it allows the alpha to capture quick changes in the market. Decay is another important setting because it decides how much weight you give to recent data. A lower decay value will focus more on the latest information, which can be useful for fast reacting signals like short horizon momentum or price pressure. You can also try running your alpha in smaller and more liquid universes, since they often give smoother fills and better performance. Finally, if your alpha is stable but does not move much, increasing its volatility slightly can help lift returns without breaking the overall behavior of the signal.

To boost performance, try increasing trade speed for short-lived insights and weighting the latest info more heavily. Stick to easily tradable markets and lean into steady signals. Even modest structural changes can significantly improve your results.

Good points. alpha returns can be improved by raising turnover for short-term signals, tuning decay to weight recent data more heavily, choosing smaller or more liquid universes, and slightly increasing volatility for stable, low-variance signals.

These tips nicely summarize several of the main levers that actually move returns on the Brain platform, but the key is aligning each lever with the true nature of the signal. Turnover, for example, should never be increased blindly—higher turnover only improves returns when the underlying signal genuinely captures short-horizon information such as order-flow imbalance, short-term momentum, or rapid mean reversion. In those cases, pairing higher turnover with an appropriately low decay ensures that the alpha reacts quickly without carrying stale information. Decay itself is often underestimated: small adjustments can materially change how responsive a signal is, and testing multiple decay settings across delays can reveal whether the predictive power is front-loaded or more persistent. Universe selection is another powerful dimension; smaller, more liquid universes tend to reduce noise, improve execution realism, and often produce cleaner cross-sectional behavior. Finally, volatility “nudging” should be applied cautiously—scaling or volatility amplification works best only after confirming that the signal is stable across time, delays, and regions, otherwise it simply magnifies noise. When used together thoughtfully, these adjustments can lift returns without sacrificing robustness.

Thank you for sharing these practical and experience-driven tips. Posts like this are especially valuable because they focus on concrete adjustments that researchers can actually test and apply, rather than abstract theory. The emphasis on matching turnover and decay to the true horizon of the signal is a great reminder that alpha tuning should follow signal behavior, not the other way around. Highlighting universe selection and liquidity is also very helpful, since those settings are often overlooked but can make a meaningful difference in real performance. I also appreciate the note on volatility nudging, as it encourages researchers to think about signal strength and stability before trying to amplify returns. Overall, this is a clear and actionable summary that both newer and more experienced Brain users can benefit from. Thanks again for contributing such useful guidance to the community.

Appreciate you sharing this. There are several ways to enhance alpha returns depending on the signal’s nature—this can include allowing higher turnover for genuinely short-horizon ideas, tuning decay to place more weight on recent observations, or selecting smaller or more liquid universes. For signals that are stable but exhibit low variance, modest volatility scaling can also help boost returns without fundamentally changing the alpha’s behavior.
