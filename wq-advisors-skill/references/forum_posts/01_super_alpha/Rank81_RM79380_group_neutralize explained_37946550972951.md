**group_neutralize(x, group): removing industry bias**

Many factors unintentionally load on industries or sectors. This creates concentration risk and makes performance depend more on sector moves than on stock selection.

`group_neutralize(x, group)`  fixes this by  **removing the group-level average**  from each stock’s value, leaving only the  **within-group signal** .

**What it does**

- Computes the mean of  `x`  within each group
- Subtracts that mean from each stock
- Result: values centered around zero  **inside each group**

**Why it’s useful** 
After neutralization, a stock’s score reflects  **how it compares to peers in the same group** , not whether the whole industry looks good or bad.

group_neutralize(x, group) is the surgical tool used to strip away sector-level noise, ensuring your alpha captures true stock-specific signals rather than just riding an industry wave.

Without neutralization, a high-performing sector can inflate the scores of every stock within it, creating massive concentration risk. If that industry pivots, your entire alpha collapses. By subtracting the group mean from each constituent, you isolate the  **relative outperformance**  of a stock against its direct peers.

The result is a "within-group" signal where every sector is centered at zero. This ensures your performance is driven by smart stock selection (intra-industry) rather than a lucky bet on a specific macro sector .
