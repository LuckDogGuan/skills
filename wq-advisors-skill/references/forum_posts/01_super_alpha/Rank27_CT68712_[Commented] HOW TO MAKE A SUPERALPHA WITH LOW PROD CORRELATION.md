I update all alpha OS to the database and tag them. Then, I measure their correlation. I use queries to select alphas that meet my desired criteria (e.g., correlation < 0.7) and use their tags with the  `in_tag`  function for selection. This way, I can choose alphas based on my queries, including reducing correlation as you mentioned.

Hello,

I am facing the same issue since last one month, the production correlation in super alphas has been increased around 0.8 ,0.9 these days.

Any help in reducing the correlation in superalpha is really appreciated.

- **Use Region-Specific Datasets** : In the Europe region, some datasets might offer more predictive power due to their relevance. Consider focusing on:
  - **Macroeconomic indicators**  such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and inflation data specific to European countries.
  - **Regional corporate earnings**  or financials for stocks based in Europe.
  - **Sentiment analysis**  of news related to the European economy, which could capture investor sentiment more effectively.

Hi  [SY65468](/hc/en-us/profiles/23932095260567-SY65468) ,

When you write a selection expression, by default, you are selecting all alphas that meet your criteria from the alpha pool of your country. However, if you use *own in the selection expression, only your alphas will be selected.

For example, if you want to select 50 alphas with a turnover < 0.25, this will select 50 alphas from your country pool that meet that criterion. If you add *own to the expression, only your alphas will be selected.

Regarding low correlation, try selecting a unique set of alphas and using distinct combo expressions. For instance, the  `combo_a`  operator, which may not be widely used, can help reduce correlation. Additionally, consider creating unique combinations of alphas using custom neutralizations.

The simplest way is to use different selection operators in the selection expression you can multiply multiple conditions that can help you make unique super alphas , for selecting other's alphas you can just write your selection expression because unless you write (own) in the selection expression it does take other users alphas as well

**Diversify Your Alpha Pool:** 
A diverse pool of Alphas makes it easier to build well-rounded SuperAlphas. Include different datasets, categories, and operators to create a variety of Alphas.

**Minimize Self-Correlation:** 
Self-correlation can limit the effectiveness of your SuperAlphas. To avoid this, use unique logic for each SuperAlpha, incorporating different datasets and turnover ranges.

**Take Advantage of Tagging Features:** 
Use tagging to filter and select specific Alphas based on tags, making it easier to choose Alphas that align with your strategy.

Regarding low correlation, try selecting a unique set of alphas and using different combo expressions. Selection function, choose the alpha with low correlation. To select other alphas you write a selection expression, by default, you are selecting all alphas meeting your criteria from your country's alpha pool. Because unless you write (self) in the selection expression, it takes other users' alphas as well. Creating regular alphas with low correlation helps you reduce the super correlation significantly.

I'm really intrigued by the discussions surrounding creating a super alpha with low production correlation! As a technical enthusiast, I find it fascinating how blending diverse datasets—like fundamental and technical indicators—can lead to more unique signal generation. For someone just starting out, I think it's pivotal to focus on understanding the different drivers of alpha in each model before diving into combinations. It seems like many have shared strategies to reduce correlation, such as employing less common fields or modifying neutralizations. I'm curious to see how others tackle the challenge of selecting and integrating diverse alphas—definitely an area where we can learn from each other!

- **Combining Conditions:**
  By multiplying different conditions in your selection expression, you can create complex, unique super alphas. Each condition acts as a filter, and multiplying them means that only stocks meeting  *all*  criteria are selected.
- **Selecting Alphas:**
  When writing your selection expression, if you don't include the term  **(own)** , the system will consider and return alphas from other users as well. So, if you want to restrict your search to your own alphas, make sure to include  **(own)**  in your expression.

This approach allows you to tailor your alpha selection precisely to your strategy. Let me know if you need further details!

Diversifying factor exposure and using clustering (e.g., PCA) can help reduce correlation when building a super alpha. Also, dynamic weighting based on rolling correlation can improve robustness.

Hi [SY65468](/hc/en-us/profiles/23932095260567-SY65468) ,

To reduce correlation, choose a unique set of alphas and use different combo expressions and neutralisations. You can also create custom combinations of alphas with neutralisations. When you write a selection expression, it picks all alphas that match your criteria from your country’s alpha pool. But if you add *own, it will only pick your own alphas. You can also use the selection expression page of Brain, which is available in the Learn section.

When building a super alpha with low correlation, ensure true diversification, not just based on historical correlation but also on return drivers and durability. Use PCA, clustering, or dynamic weighting to optimize combinations and avoid redundancy. Additionally, control transaction costs, liquidity, and adaptability to maintain stable performance.

### Optimizing Alpha Submissions for Diversity and Low Correlation:

When submitting alphas, aim for a  **diverse mix**  of regular alphas and datasets. To enhance selection:

- **Prioritize Low-Correlation Alphas** : Choose alphas that are less correlated to maximize portfolio diversification.
- **Use  `ts_decay_linear`** : Applying linear decay over  **N days**  in alpha combinations can help  **reduce correlation**  and improve the robustness of  **Super Alphas** .

A well-balanced approach ensures  **better performance**  and  **stability**  across different market conditions. 🚀

### **1. Improve Diversity for Low Correlation**

- **Factor Diversification:**  Combine alphas based on different factor families—Momentum, Value, Quality, Sentiment, and Risk.
- **Non-linear Relationships:**  Use operators like  `hump_decay`  and  `ts_target_tvr_hump`  to capture non-linear effects.
- **Sector Neutrality:**  Ensure your alphas are not concentrated in specific sectors, as that can drive correlation.

### **2. Selecting Alphas for Super Alpha Construction**

- **Low Correlation:**  Select alphas with  **pairwise correlation < 0.3**
- **High IR:**  Prioritize alphas with an IR > 1.0 over the production period.
- **Stable IC:**  Look for alphas with stable IC across different market regimes.
- **Drawdown Control:**  Avoid alphas with high drawdowns, as they can destabilize the super alpha.

Creating a super alpha sounds like a challenging yet exciting task! To minimize production correlation, you might consider diversifying the sources of your alphas, focusing on varying market conditions, or employing different strategies. Additionally, when selecting others' alphas, analyze their performance metrics and consider how they complement your own ideas. Have you thought about backtesting these combinations before finalizing your super alpha?

Your approach to updating, tagging, and selecting alphas based on correlation is a solid method for refining your portfolio. Here’s how you can further enhance it:

1. **Tagging & Querying** : Using the  **in_tag**  function allows for structured selection, ensuring that only alphas meeting specific criteria (e.g., correlation < 0.7) are chosen.
2. **Refined Selection** : By default, your selection pulls from the country-wide alpha pool. Adding  ***own**  ensures only your alphas are considered.
3. **Reducing Correlation** : Utilize  **combo_a**  or other unique combination operators to construct diversified alphas.
4. **Custom Neutralizations** : Apply tailored neutralization techniques to create distinct,  **low-correlation alphas**  while maintaining performance.

By integrating these strategies, you can systematically build a robust, uncorrelated alpha portfolio.

When writing a selection expression, by default, it selects all alphas from your country’s alpha pool that meet the specified criteria. However, if you include *own in the expression, only your alphas will be selected, filtering out alphas from others.

For example, if you're aiming to select 50 alphas with a turnover less than 0.25, this would select 50 alphas from the pool that meet the condition. But if you add *own to the expression, only your alphas will be selected, excluding others.

To reduce correlation between alphas, try using distinct combo expressions, such as the combo_a operator, which can help create unique alphas. Additionally, you can create custom neutralizations to further separate alphas and reduce overlap. Another approach is to use multiple selection operators, combining different conditions to create unique super alphas. If you want to include other users’ alphas, simply leave out the *own keyword in the selection expression. How do you usually approach ensuring diversity and low correlation when selecting alphas?

To build a  **super alpha with low production correlation** :

**Select diverse alphas**  – Low correlation (<0.2), mix time horizons & data types (technical, fundamental, sentiment).
 **Optimize weighting**  – Use equal weighting, volatility scaling, or ML-based optimization.

**Control correlation**  – Monitor rolling correlation, apply neutralization, and use decay & smoothing techniques.
