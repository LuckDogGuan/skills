## 帖子正文

I’ve built a few alphas that scored well and contributed nicely — but I couldn’t help noticing some submissions achieving  **scores above 40,000** . Impressive!

It made me wonder:
🔹 What strategies or principles helped you reach those kinds of numbers?
🔹 Were there specific operator combinations or clever grouping tactics involved?

Curious to learn what others focused on. If you're comfortable sharing, I’d love to hear the process behind your strongest alpha so far.

Those tests are the first tests with very high performance in terms of sharpe, margin, and very low corr, which will bring very high scores, but in the long run, they will max out and will not be able to add many more points in the future. With high IS scores, OS is often prone to overfit.

Top-performing alphas in Super Alpha competitions typically rely on  **normalised, cross-sectional signals**  using  `rank()`  and  `zscore()`  to reduce noise. They blend  **fundamental data,**   **technical indicators**  , and sometimes  **analyst behaviour**  . Strong alphas apply  **time-series transformations**  like  `ts_min` ,  `ts_max` , and  `ts_rank`  to capture trends or reversals. The best are  **orthogonal to others** , have  **stable IC** , and work across regimes. They minimise overfitting with low complexity, avoid extreme turnover, and are often constructed as  **modular components**  that can be combined effectively into higher-performing combos.

My highest scoring alphas came from focusing on complementary signal combinations rather than just high individual performances. I carefully selected alphas with low correlations and balanced risk profiles, particularly with Power Pool and Risk Neutralized categories. The key was creating logical groupings that targeted different market inefficiencies and time horizons. Low turnover strategies performed exceptionally well in scoring. Rather than chasing IS performance, I prioritized robust implementation and clear theoretical foundations which translated to strong OS performance – where 75% of the final score comes from.

I found my top Super Alpha excelled by combining a long-term Cauchy TS quantile filter (252 days) with a short-term arg_min layer for mean reversion, then enforcing risk-neutralization and strict turnover caps to avoid overfitting and sustain high IS scores.

Interesting question! I agree with 顾问 PN39025 (Rank 87)’s point about the trade-off between short-term high scores and long-term sustainability. In my experience, the top-performing alphas usually rely on creative operator stacking and leveraging unique insights from feature engineering. However, these approaches can often lead to overfitting in OS if not carefully validated. It’s crucial to monitor out-of-sample performance and diversify operator usage to avoid getting stuck in local maxima. Curious to hear if anyone has long-term robust strategies to maintain high scores without sacrificing stability!

Honestly, nothing special. Just:

- The alpha sets in the submitted super alphas will be the ones that do not intersect or intersect as little as possible.
- Select as many alphas as possible in a super alpha.
- Depending on the categories you can think more.

But all that just helps to score better in IS, there is no guarantee outside of OS.

### 评论 #7 (作者: 顾问 TN48242 (Rank 82), 时间: 1年前)

In my experience, one of the most important principles for building a strong Super Alpha is holistic diversification—not just in alpha selection, but across regions, sectors, and market characteristics. For competitions involving multiple regions like GLB, ASI, or CHN, spreading alpha exposure evenly helps mitigate OS risk due to macro shifts or region-specific anomalies. Rather than blindly maximizing the number of alphas, I prioritize selecting those with stable statistical behavior and low redundancy. It’s also critical to monitor turnover and IS/OS stability to avoid overfitting. Another key point is to think structurally: building a Super Alpha is not about stacking high-IS alphas, but about organizing them into a balanced, resilient framework. Grouping by factor type, volatility regime, or liquidity profile can make a real difference. Ultimately, thoughtful composition beats raw quantity—and it gives your Super Alpha a better chance to sustain performance in both IS and OS.

Many high-scoring tests perform well early due to strong Sharpe, low correlation, and high margin, but they often hit a ceiling and risk overfitting in OS. To boost IS scores, it's helpful to use alpha sets that overlap as little as possible, include many diverse alphas in super alphas, and explore different categories. Signals with low correlation to existing ones, combining short- and long-term features, and smart use of operators like zscorem rank and scale also help. However, strong IS results don’t guarantee OS success, so please avoid overfitting on it. Thanks!

**My thoughts on high-scoring Super Alphas:**

1. **Use lots of different alphas**  – The more, the better (as long as they aren’t too similar to each other).
2. **Make sure alphas aren’t correlated**  – If they move in the same way, they add less value. Try to mix different types.
3. **Focus on high Sharpe and margin**  – The scoring system rewards strong and clean performance in-sample.
4. **Use smart formula combos**  – Things like  `rank` ,  `ts_rank` ,  `decay_linear` , and  `correlation`  between price/volume can be powerful.
5. **Don’t trust high IS scores too much**  – They can be overfit and won’t always work well out-of-sample.
6. **Keep testing and pruning**  – I usually start with a large pool of alphas, then keep the top performers that don’t overlap too much.

For strong Super Alphas, use many diverse, uncorrelated alphas. Prioritize high Sharpe and margin, smart combos like rank and decay, and avoid overfitting. Continuously test and prune to keep only the best, non-overlapping performers.

---

### 评论 #11 (作者: AK40989, 时间: 1年前)

One approach that worked well for me was prioritizing structural diversity, combining alphas with strong standalone Sharpe and margin but low pairwise correlation, especially across different operator families. I also found that slightly sacrificing peak IS metrics for broader alpha coverage helped avoid redundancy and boosted the overall Super Alpha score without overfitting.

### 评论 #12 (作者: AC63290, 时间: 1年前)

Great question! High-scoring alphas (above 40,000) often combine:

🔹  **Low turnover**  with strong  **Sharpe** 
🔹 Smart  **neutralization**  (RAM, sector, market cap)
🔹 Clever use of  **nonlinear operators**  like  `ts_decay` ,  `prod` , or  `rank` 
🔹 Low correlation to existing signals
Grouping and cross-sectional thinking help too!

### 评论 #13 (作者: RP41479, 时间: 1年前)

To score high with Super Alphas, use a diverse mix of uncorrelated alphas, focusing on strong Sharpe ratios and margin for in-sample performance. Smart formula combinations, like rank and ts_rank, are crucial, but avoid overfitting by validating out-of-sample. Regular testing and pruning help maintain top-performing, non-overlapping alphas.

### 评论 #14 (作者: SS63636, 时间: 1年前)

Creating a high-scoring alpha in the Super Alpha competition involves a blend of meticulous data analysis, innovative feature engineering, and robust model validation. Beyond technical prowess, strategic parameter tuning and a keen understanding of market dynamics are pivotal. Would love to hear how your approach differed!

### 评论 #15 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 1年前)

Top-performing alphas in Super Alpha competitions often leverage normalized, cross-sectional signals using tools like  `rank()`  and  `zscore()`  to filter out noise and highlight relative strength. These alphas frequently combine fundamental metrics, technical indicators, and sometimes even analyst behavior signals for broader informational coverage. Many also incorporate time-series operators such as  `ts_min` ,  `ts_max` , and  `ts_rank`  to detect emerging trends or mean-reverting setups. The most effective submissions are orthogonal, maintain a stable IC, and function well across various market regimes. Rather than relying on overly complex logic, they aim for low turnover and modular construction to enhance out-of-sample performance and reduce overfitting.

From personal experience, my strongest scoring alphas came from combining complementary signals—not just optimizing individual performance. I focused on low-correlation, risk-balanced components, especially within Power Pool and Risk Neutralized frameworks. The emphasis on robustness over IS overfitting led to significantly better OS scores, which drive 75% of the final Super Alpha evaluation.How do you evaluate whether your signal combinations offer true diversification or just diluted variations of the same theme?

Top-performing alphas in Super Alpha competitions generally balance signal strength, stability, and diversity. They often rely on cross-sectional techniques like  `rank()`  or  `zscore()`  to normalize signals across stocks and mitigate noise. Instead of depending on a single data source, strong alphas blend multiple perspectives—price trends, valuation data, analyst behavior, or even liquidity patterns—to increase signal resilience.

What makes them stand out is not just predictive power but  *signal orthogonality* —being different from what others are doing—combined with consistent information coefficient (IC) over time. Techniques like  `ts_rank` ,  `ts_delta` , or  `ts_decay`  are frequently used to capture momentum, reversal, or persistence in trends.

From my perspective, the most effective alphas are those that don’t try to be too “clever” or overly optimized. Simple, interpretable logic with modest turnover often outperforms complex formulas in real-world robustness. Modular design is another strength—it allows these alphas to be used flexibly in combinations, improving overall performance and reducing overfitting risk.

To achieve a high score in the Super Alpha competition, it’s essential to build a well-diversified portfolio of uncorrelated alphas with strong Sharpe ratios and solid in-sample margins. Leveraging smart combinations of operators — like  `rank`  and  `ts_rank`  — can enhance signal effectiveness, but it's equally important to avoid overfitting by thoroughly validating on out-of-sample data.

Consistent testing and pruning of your alpha pool ensures that only the most robust and non-redundant signals remain. High-performing Super Alphas often result from a careful blend of data exploration, creative feature engineering, and thoughtful model validation.

Beyond technical skill, success also hinges on strategic parameter tuning and a clear understanding of market behavior across regimes and datasets. This balance between innovation and discipline is key to producing competitive Super Alphas.

I’d be curious to hear how your approach differs — especially in how you balance diversity, performance, and real-world applicability!

### 评论 #18 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 1年前)

To excel in the Super Alpha competition, crafting a diverse, low-correlation portfolio of alphas with strong Sharpe ratios and healthy in-sample margins is fundamental. Success hinges not just on creative expressions, but also on precision and discipline. Using operator combinations like  `rank`  and  `ts_rank`  can significantly enhance signal clarity, but guarding against overfitting is just as important—out-of-sample validation is crucial.

Regularly testing and refining your alpha pool helps eliminate redundancy and retain only the most stable, high-conviction signals. The top-performing Super Alphas often emerge from a well-structured workflow that blends deep data exploration, innovative feature construction, and rigorous cross-validation.

Equally important is the ability to adapt: tuning parameters effectively and recognizing how different market regimes impact signal behavior. Achieving that balance between novelty and reliability is what sets great submissions apart.

How do you approach this balance in your own process—especially when choosing between raw creativity and practical robustness?

Great question ,Reaching high scores like 40,000 is impressive, and it would be really helpful to understand what strategies worked best. For me, focusing on strong signal-to-noise ratios, using stable universes, and keeping expressions clean and interpretable made a big difference. I also found that smart operator pairing and time-based logic like  `ts_delta`  or  `ts_rank`  helped improve consistency. Would love to hear how others approached it especially if you used unique filters or optimization tricks.

### 评论 #20 (作者: SD92473, 时间: 1年前)

A core principle in building a strong Super Alpha is  **holistic diversification** —not just in alpha selection, but also across regions, sectors, and market regimes. In multi-region setups like GLB, ASI, or CHN, evenly distributed exposure helps reduce out-of-sample (OS) risk from macro or regional anomalies. Rather than maximizing the alpha count, I focus on selecting signals with stable stats, low redundancy, and strong IS/OS consistency. Monitoring turnover and performance drift is also crucial to avoid overfitting. Importantly, Super Alpha construction isn't about stacking high-IS performers, but designing a resilient, well-structured framework. Grouping alphas by factor type, volatility regime, or liquidity profile enhances balance. In the long run, thoughtful structure and quality beat sheer quantity for sustainable performance.

### 评论 #25 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 10个月前)

You’ve summarized the core challenge perfectly: balancing raw innovation with disciplined validation is the art behind top-tier Super Alphas. In my workflow, I start by encouraging creativity—generating a broad set of candidate signals using diverse operators like rank and ts_rank to capture different market nuances. But from there, the focus shifts to rigor: applying out-of-sample testing and rolling validations to weed out signals that overfit or lack consistency.

I also prioritize low correlation within the alpha pool to maximize diversification benefits. Periodic pruning based on turnover, Sharpe, and IC stability helps maintain a lean, high-quality set. Parameter tuning is done thoughtfully, often adapting thresholds or neutralizations based on recent regime shifts observed in performance updates.

Ultimately, it’s an iterative dance—explore widely, then refine tightly. How about you? What strategies or workflows do you find effective for maintaining that balance between novelty and robustness?

You’ve articulated the essence of Super Alpha creation really well—it’s all about balancing creative exploration with disciplined validation. In my workflow, I start by generating a wide set of candidate signals using operators like  `rank`  and  `ts_rank`  to capture different market dynamics. Then comes the crucial step: rigorous out-of-sample testing and rolling validations to filter out overfitting or inconsistent signals.

I place a strong emphasis on low correlation across the alpha pool to maximize diversification. Periodic pruning based on turnover, Sharpe ratio, and IC stability helps keep the portfolio lean and high-quality. Parameter tuning is done carefully, often adjusting thresholds or neutralizations to reflect recent regime shifts or performance updates.

In short, it’s an iterative cycle: explore broadly, refine meticulously. I’m curious—what approaches do you use to maintain the balance between novelty, robustness, and real-world applicability in your alpha workflows?
