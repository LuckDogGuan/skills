If you’ve only been creating regular Alphas, SuperAlphas might sound advanced — but they’re actually very beginner-friendly once you see a simple example.

A SuperAlpha =
•  **Selection Expression**  (which Alphas to pick)
•  **Combo Expression**  (how to weight them)

Example to start simple:

**Selection idea:** 
Select stable Alphas with low turnover and low correlation.

```
turnover < 0.3 && self_correlation <= 0.6

```

**Combo idea:** 
Equal weighting (good for beginners).

```
1

```

That’s it — you’ve already built your first SuperAlpha logic.

💡 Important note for newcomers:
Inside SuperAlpha simulations we mainly see  **IS performance** , not the true OS results. That’s why I personally treat SuperAlphas as a  *research tool*  first — focus on robustness and diversity instead of chasing high Sharpe.

Beginner tips:
✔ Start with selection_limit around 10–20
✔ Use different datasets/categories to avoid similar signals
✔ Keep combo expression simple before getting advanced

If you’ve been building only regular Alphas, try combining a few — you might be surprised how much smoother the equity curve becomes.

How did your first SuperAlpha go?

Great breakdown. The point about treating SuperAlphas primarily as a  **research tool**  rather than just chasing IS Sharpe is crucial. It’s easy to get blinded by the simulation numbers, but focusing on the robustness of the underlying Alphas and low correlation definitely pays off better in the long run. Thanks for the clear example!

This is a fantastic breakdown of SuperAlphas for beginners! I really appreciate the emphasis on treating them as a research tool initially; focusing on robustness and diversity makes so much sense for building a solid foundation. My first foray into SuperAlphas was similar, trying to combine a few diverse, stable alphas with equal weighting, and it definitely smoothed out the equity curve in backtests. A question that often comes up for me is how to systematically find those "stable Alphas with low turnover and low correlation" – do you have any go-to strategies for uncovering alphas that meet those criteria efficiently during the selection phase?

### 评论 #38 (作者: FM47631, 时间: 4个月前)

Great point, JL20733! Treating Super Alphas as a  **robustness check**  rather than a Sharpe-chaser is the best advice for any beginner.

Replying to  **NS62681** : One way to find those "stable Alphas" systematically is to filter for  **Sector Neutrality**  in your selection expression. If your sub-alphas are forced to find idiosyncratic gains rather than just riding a sector trend, their correlations naturally drop. This makes even a simple equal-weighted "Combo" much more effective!

### 评论 #124 (作者: KP26017, 时间: 3个月前)

Really clean intro for newcomers and the framing of SuperAlpha as a research tool rather than a Sharpe-chasing exercise is exactly the right mindset to instill early.

The point about only seeing IS performance in SuperAlpha simulations is critical and worth emphasizing even more strongly. A lot of people build their first SuperAlpha, see a beautiful smooth equity curve with high Sharpe, and assume they've found something special. What they've often done is selected their best IS-performing regular alphas and combined them — which is essentially in-sample selection bias compounded across multiple alphas simultaneously. The smoothness is partially real diversification and partially an artifact of selecting winners after the fact.

**What actually makes a SuperAlpha robust:**

Your selection criteria are the most important design decision and most beginners underinvest here. Filtering by turnover and self-correlation as you've shown is a good start. Adding consistency filters — selecting alphas with stable rolling IC rather than just high average IC — tends to produce much more durable combined performance because you're selecting for reliability not just strength.
