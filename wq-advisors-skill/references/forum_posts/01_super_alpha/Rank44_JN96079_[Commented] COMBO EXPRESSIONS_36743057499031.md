In Super Alpha, the second argument of functions like
group_rank(signal, x) or group_neutralize(signal, x) must be a grouping field—the most common being a categorical classification that clusters securities into meaningful buckets.

Here are the common group fields you can use to replace x:

Valid group fields

You can use any of the following:

sector

industry

subindustry

country

region

market

exchange

The argument  `x`  in  `group_rank(signal, x)`  requires a categorical classifier. Standard fundamental fields include  **sector** ,  **industry** , and  **subindustry** . In multi-region universes,  **country**  and  **exchange**  are essential for neutralizing geographic bias.

However, sophisticated combinations often require dynamic grouping. You can construct  **style buckets**  (e.g., Size, Liquidity, or Volatility deciles) to force your alpha to be neutral specifically against those risk factors.

You could cook up your own group by bucket() function,

and also get the eligible group fields on data explorer through filter: type = group

Thank you for raising this question — grouping is one of those concepts that seems simple at first but has a major impact on how Super Alpha expressions behave. Your example highlights a situation many researchers encounter when experimenting with combo expressions, and asking about what can replace the group field helps others understand the flexibility and purpose of group-based transformations. Sharing these kinds of questions strengthens the community because it invites discussion on best practices, such as when to choose industry versus sector versus country groupings. I appreciate you starting this conversation, as it encourages others to think more carefully about how cross-sectional structure influences alpha construction. Thanks again for bringing attention to an important and often overlooked aspect of expression design.

You’ve already got the standard group fields listed, but one thing that’s easy to miss is that the second argument doesn’t have to be only the built-in classifications. Any field that is  *categorical*  works. That includes:

• All the usual ones (sector, industry, subindustry, country, exchange, region)
• Any dataset field marked as  `type = group`  in Data Explorer
• Anything you build yourself with bucket(), like buckets of volatility, liquidity, size, turnover, etc.

So group_rank(expr, x) basically accepts two types of inputs:

1. A fixed classification (industry, country, etc.)
2. A custom grouping you create to force the alpha to behave neutrally relative to some factor structure.

This second approach is underrated because you can shape the cross-section any way you want. For example:

group_rank(expr, bucket(vol_20d, 10))
or
group_neutralize(expr, bucket(market_cap, 20))

This gives you much finer control than only relying on industry or sector.

Thanks for raising this question — grouping may appear simple, but it has a significant impact on how Super Alpha expressions behave, and your example reflects a situation many researchers face when experimenting with combination logic. Asking what can replace the group field is helpful because it highlights the flexibility and purpose of group-based transformations, including when to choose industry, sector, or country groupings. Conversations like this encourage others to think more carefully about cross-sectional structure and its effect on alpha construction, and they help strengthen community understanding of best practices. Thanks again for bringing attention to an important yet often overlooked aspect of expression design.

This is a good question because combo expressions can become very powerful when the group field is chosen well. In most cases, the field that replaces x is something meaningful like sector, industry, country, or even market cap buckets. These help you compare stocks within a similar context instead of ranking everything together. You can also try volatility groups or liquidity groups if your idea depends on trading behavior. The key is to choose a field that matches the logic of your signal so the ranking becomes more focused. I would be interested to hear what group fields others have found useful in their own work.

Great question—grouping seems simple but greatly affects Super Alpha behavior. Your example shows a common challenge in combo expressions, and asking about alternatives to group fields highlights flexibility in design. Sharing these questions sparks discussion on best practices like choosing industry, sector, or country groupings. Thanks for starting this—it helps everyone think more carefully about cross-sectional structure in alpha construction.

Thank you for raising this question—it’s a very practical one that many researchers encounter when they start working seriously with combo expressions and Super Alphas. Grouping often looks like a small syntax detail at first, but as this discussion shows, it has a major impact on how signals behave cross-sectionally and how much unintended bias they carry. I really appreciate how the community shared both the standard group fields and more advanced ideas like custom buckets, because that helps clarify not just  *what*  is allowed, but  *why*  certain choices make sense. Threads like this are especially valuable because they turn platform mechanics into design intuition, helping others build cleaner and more purposeful expressions. Thanks again for starting the conversation and encouraging deeper thinking around grouping logic in alpha construction.

Good question. In SuperAlpha combo expressions,  `x`  in functions like  `group_rank()`  can be any  **valid group field**  that defines how instruments are partitioned. Commonly used ones include:

•  `sector` ,  `industry` ,  `subindustry` 
•  `country`  or  `region` 
• Liquidity or size buckets (e.g.,  `bucket(rank(market_cap), …)` )
• Volatility or turnover buckets
• Custom groups created via  `bucket()`  on any continuous field

In practice, sector/industry groups are the most stable, while custom buckets are useful when you want finer structural differentiation.

### 评论 #14 (作者: NS62681, 时间: 6个月前)

Since combo expressions become much more effective when the group field is chosen thoughtfully. In practice, the replacement for  *x*  is usually a meaningful grouping such as sector, industry, country, or market-cap buckets, which allows stocks to be compared within a relevant peer set rather than across the entire universe. Depending on the intuition, volatility or liquidity groupings can also make sense.

> The  `x`  parameter in  `group_rank(signal, x)`  requires categorical classification, typically sector, industry, or geographic identifiers. Advanced implementations may employ dynamic style buckets (e.g., Size, Liquidity, Volatility deciles) to explicitly enforce factor neutrality.
