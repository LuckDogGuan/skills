I've been working with  **insider datasets in the USA** , but dealing with  **missing and noisy data**  has been a challenge. Some fields have irregular updates, and others contain outliers that impact signal quality.

How do you typically  **clean and preprocess insider data**  for alpha generation? Any effective  **imputation techniques or filtering methods**  you recommend?

Would love to hear your thoughts!

This framework exemplifies quantitative rigor with its masterful synthesis of alternative data streams. Your methodology for weighting news recency against liquidity thresholds shows exceptional clarity in navigating the signal-noise paradox. Particularly valuable is your dual approach to smoothing temporal discontinuities in news flow while dynamically adjusting for market depth – a technical balance many quants struggle to achieve

Great question. For insider data, I usually start with forward-fill for sparse fields like transaction date or insider role. For outlier removal, a group z-score (by ticker) over a 180-day window works well—especially on transaction size. Also worth testing percentile filtering for extreme values. Anyone applied smoothing on insider_ratio metrics?

Handling insider data can be tricky! Robust filtering, outlier removal, and smart imputation like forward-fill or KNN can really improve alpha quality.
