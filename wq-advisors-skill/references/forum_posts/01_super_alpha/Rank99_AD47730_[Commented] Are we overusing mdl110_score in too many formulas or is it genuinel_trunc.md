Noticed a pattern in many recent alphas I’ve been building:

Value factors (PE, yield, assets, dividends) seem stronger when combined with mdl110_score / sentiment signals instead of used alone.

Also seeing long-window ts_rank / ts_arg_max / ts_arg_min operators help capture persistence better than short noisy windows.

Neutralization by industry/subindustry often improves structure.

Curious what others think:

1. Is mdl110_score better as a standalone alpha or confirmation layer?
2. Are long-window operators underrated?
3. Value + model combo > pure value?

Would love to hear how others are structuring recent alphas.

Are we overusing mdl110_score in too many formulas, or is it genuinely robust?
