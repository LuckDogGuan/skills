With the latest EUR update, the universe TOP2500 has been added, and "EUR D1 Theme" are now available. It is remarkably user-friendly, and I encourage those who have not experienced it to give it a try.

Here are some useful tips :

- Since the EUR TOP2500 and TOP1200 share same datasets and datafields, when using the API to retrieve dataset/datafield information (e.g., usercount, alphacount), it is recommended to obtain the information from TOP1200.
- The cost of EUR TOP2500 makes it a good fit to use with the new Investability Constrained data to enhance submit strategies.

Recommended Datasets (User-friendly dataset IMO) :  analyst69, fundamental31, other466, pv106

fun fact1 : South Africa is covered in EUR region

fun fact2 : GPT comments often outnumber likes on posts.

Every upvote is greatly appreciated.

You're very welcome! I'm glad the tips have been helpful for you. 😊 It sounds like you're making great strides with your strategy in the EUR region. Leveraging datasets like  **analyst69** ,  **fundamental31** , and  **pv106**  alongside  **Investability Constrained**  data should provide a solid foundation for your alphas.

If you apply the fixes to the  **Sub-universe Sharpe error**  and start seeing improvements, that's a great sign! And don't hesitate to reach out if you need more detailed insights or run into any other challenges with your strategy. Whether it's fine-tuning alpha performance, exploring new datasets, or diving deeper into any aspect, I'm here to help!

Looking forward to hearing how things progress! Keep me posted, and feel free to reach out anytime. 😊🚀

I tried running some of the tests you suggested but most of them got sub-universe sharpe and high correlation. I can fix it to pass those tests but it takes more than 6 operators. Can you give me some suggestions to reduce the number of operators to do?

[TT55495](/hc/en-us/profiles/13132630342807-TT55495)  you can find some clue in the doc  [https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/advanced-topics/getting-started-investability-constrained-metrics](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/advanced-topics/getting-started-investability-constrained-metrics) 
or simply add some benchmark based on investability-constrained-metrics before submit

If alphas still can't pass sub-universe test, I'll just move forward to next idea.

Thanks for sharing. But sometime, when I tried to create alphas in TOP2500, it may contain some of Low-liquidity stocks, therefore, the simulated alpha may have risks in real life trading, therefore, the OS is not stable. Do you have some tip for me to handle with that ?

Hi there! When simulating alpha, next to the "Simulate" button, you'll find a "Visualization" option. Click on it to view detailed metrics about your alpha, such as coverage, average size, etc. This will help you identify areas for improvement. However, keep in mind that using visualization will significantly increase simulation time. Therefore, it's best to use this feature during the middle and final stages of your alpha development process. Have a great day!

This update brings exciting opportunities with the EUR TOP2500 universe and "EUR D1 Theme"! The compatibility with TOP1200 simplifies data retrieval, and the cost-effectiveness makes it a strong candidate for Investability Constrained strategies. The recommended datasets provide a great starting point for analysis. Also, the fun facts add a nice touch—especially the GPT comment one!

[顾问 YW82626 (Rank 1)](/hc/en-us/profiles/13254166584471-顾问 YW82626 (Rank 1))  you can check countries in a region by using the visualization feature which can be activated by clicking on the button right next to "Simulate". Now when you simulate you can view a lot of details about the data field/region/industries as well as see how your alpha is performing in them. Read more about it here  [https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/consultant-information/visualization-tool](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/consultant-information/visualization-tool)

Another fun fact is Australia and New Zealand is part of ASI region :P

Hello KK82709. I need to clarify this issue.
How can you leverage the EUR TOP2500 update and Investability Constrained data to enhance your trading strategies and dataset selection?

---

### 评论 #30 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 1年前)

The EUR update and the addition of the TOP2500 universe bring valuable enhancements to alpha research by expanding the dataset options and introducing new features like "EUR D1 Theme." For those leveraging the API, it's important to note that the TOP2500 and TOP1200 share similar datasets and data fields, which makes retrieving information (e.g., user count, alpha count) from the TOP1200 more efficient. This is especially useful when considering cost constraints, as TOP2500, while comprehensive, can be resource-heavy. Combining this with Investability Constrained data allows for more refined strategy submissions, making the TOP2500 a practical choice for certain types of analysis. Recommended datasets like analyst69, fundamental31, and pv106 are excellent resources, offering a diverse set of factors for enhancing alpha research. Additionally, the inclusion of South Africa in the EUR region is a useful expansion, offering more geographic diversity for global alpha strategies. Understanding these data nuances will allow researchers to make more informed decisions about dataset selection and API usage, optimizing both cost and performance.
