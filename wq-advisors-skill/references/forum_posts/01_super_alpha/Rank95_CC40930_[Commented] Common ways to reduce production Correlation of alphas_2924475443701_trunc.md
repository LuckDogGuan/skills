1.Try using different operators under the same category type like ts_quantile,ts_zscore,ts_scale,ts_rank

2.Try using same alpha in less explored regions like China,GLB,Taiwan etc.

3.Try using different neutralization settings

4.If you are using group_cartesian_product,try different grouping category.Different options are exchange,country,market,sector,industry, subindustry

Hi  [顾问 AM60509 (Rank 61)](/hc/en-us/profiles/25127049757975-顾问 AM60509 (Rank 61))

Thank you for your incredible efforts in contributing to the community, especially in finding solutions to reduce correlations among alphas. Your suggestions are insightful and valuable. Here's a detailed appreciation for each idea:

1. **Experimenting with different operators within the same category:**
   This is a creative approach to enhancing diversity. Utilizing operators like  `ts_quantile` ,  `ts_zscore` ,  `ts_scale` , and  `ts_rank`  not only explores different aspects of the data but also increases the likelihood of generating alphas with low correlations.
2. **Applying alphas to less explored regions:**
   Expanding to regions such as China, GLB, and Taiwan is a smart strategy. These regions often have unique market characteristics, and applying alphas there could uncover fresh opportunities.
3. **Experimenting with different neutralization setups:**
   Adjusting neutralization setups is an effective way to control undesired factors and focus more on the alpha signal. Testing various neutralization methods, such as by sector, region, or specific risk factors, can make a significant difference.
4. **Exploring different group categories in  `group_cartesian_product` :**
   The idea of changing group categories (e.g., exchange, country, market, region, sector, or sub-sector) is an excellent way to optimize alpha combinations. This not only reduces correlation but also brings richness to potential alpha solutions.

These suggestions reflect great dedication and will undoubtedly help the community achieve significant progress in building more effective alphas. Thank you again for sharing such fantastic ideas! 🌟

Neutralization involves removing the effects of certain factors or characteristics from the alpha signal. By experimenting with different neutralization settings (such as factors like size, momentum, volatility, etc.), you can reduce the influence of these correlated factors, potentially lowering the overall correlation of the alphas.

### 评论 #9 (作者: ND68030, 时间: 1年前)

Thank you for sharing. Instead of using alphas with the same frequency daily or weekly, you can experiment with different frequencies, such as monthly or quarterly. This helps generate signals with different lags and reduces the likelihood of them being strongly correlated in the short term.

Here are some methods I often use to address prod_corr:

**Work with less popular Datasets** 
(Note the risks if the dataset is not of good quality, but it could also be an unexplored dataset.)

**Focus on regions like TWN and HKG** 
These regions tend to have lower correlations. Conversely, regions like the USA and EUR generally exhibit higher correlations.

**Utilize powerful but less commonly used operators:** vector_neut
vector_proj
regression_neut
regression_proj

Neutralization removes the impact of specific factors (e.g., size, momentum, volatility) from an alpha signal, allowing it to focus on unique predictive insights. Experimenting with different neutralization settings helps reduce correlations with common market factors, improving the alpha's uniqueness and potentially enhancing performance.

### 评论 #25 (作者: TL60820, 时间: 1年前)

You can experiment with different ways to implement your idea or modify how you use operators. For example, instead of directly using a simple z-score formula, you could implement it in a more customized manner:

`ts_zscore = (x - ts_mean(x, d)) / ts_std_dev(x, d)`

In this case,  `ts_mean(x, d)`  calculates the moving average over a window of size  `d` , and  `ts_std_dev(x, d)`  computes the standard deviation over the same window. This approach gives you a more dynamic z-score that accounts for recent trends and volatility in the data, making it more adaptive to varying market conditions. By adjusting the window size  `d` , you can fine-tune how responsive the z-score is to short-term versus long-term movements, offering greater flexibility in alpha signal creation.

Hi  [VV63697](/hc/en-us/profiles/22631087402903-VV63697) ,

In China, the "Analyst" data category offers great potential for generating strong alpha signals if you pay close attention to the details of the data fields. By blending these analyst fields with other categories, you can efficiently complete pyramids across various categories while achieving impressive alpha performance.

### 评论 #31 (作者: AB15407, 时间: 1年前)

To reduce the production correlation of alphas, I usually apply the following methods:

From the data field selection stage, I choose data fields with a moderate number of submissions.
I try to create alphas using less commonly utilized operators such as vector_neut and vector_proj.
I start by testing in the USA market first. If successful, I then deploy to AMR and similar markets.
Alternatively, you could begin with ASI and expand to HKG, JPN.
Adjust Neutralization to either Fast or Slow modes.
I hope you find your approach through one of these steps.

In my experience, if you have an alpha that is good enough to submit but has a bit of a correlation (say 0.71 to 0.74), you can try a few quick tips to reduce the correlation: changing Decay Settings, or using the ts_decay_linear operator. Also, experimenting with neutralization settings or universe are quick things to try. Hope that helps.

Hi,
Any onre can improve their strategy by experimenting with different operators within the same category, such as ts_quantile, ts_zscore, ts_scale, and ts_rank. Additionally, try applying the same alpha in less explored regions like China, GLB, or Taiwan to see how it performs. Don’t forget to test different neutralization settings for better results. If you're using group_cartesian_product, try different grouping categories like exchange, country, market, sector, industry, or subindustry to see what works best.
