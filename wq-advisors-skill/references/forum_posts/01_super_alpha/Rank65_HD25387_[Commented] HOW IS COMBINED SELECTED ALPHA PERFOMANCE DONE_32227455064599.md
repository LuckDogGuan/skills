A question has been running around my head, till now I do not know how or the criterea used in selecting the alphas to be used in combined selected alpha perfomance. I do not know if they major either in one region or they just pick the best alphas all along the the quarter period or what procedure or criteria they used to select the alphas to be used. Can someone enlighten me on the criteria used to select the alphas to be used in the combined selected alpha perfomance. I will appreciate much, Thankyou in advance.

Actually many of the things or criterias WQ uses are unknown to us. Maybe thats done to not create biasness in performance as if we know the procedure many of us would tune signals to achieve that.

From what I understand, Combined Selected Alpha Performance (CSAP) is based on a subset of your alphas that are actively selected for combos during the quarter. It’s not tied to one region — rather, it reflects alphas that consistently add value across pools and are picked more often by the system or researchers. So it’s more about  *real contribution*  than just raw IR.

**Combined Selected Alpha Performance**  involves merging multiple carefully chosen alpha signals to create a single, stronger predictive model. Researchers develop many alphas—quantitative signals forecasting asset returns—and select a subset based on performance, low correlation, and robustness. These selected alphas are combined, often using weighted linear combinations or optimization techniques, to maximize expected returns while controlling risk.

The combined alpha’s performance is evaluated through backtesting, focusing on metrics like the Information Ratio (alpha return relative to risk), Sharpe Ratio, and consistency over time. Transaction costs and turnover are also considered to ensure real-world profitability. This process is iterative: underperforming alphas may be dropped, weights adjusted, and new alphas added to improve results.

Overall, the goal is to leverage diversification and complementarity among alphas to enhance predictive accuracy, robustness, and profitability, forming a resilient and effective trading strategy.

Thanks for raising this important question! From what I gather, the Combined Selected Alpha Performance focuses on alphas that the system actively picks for combos, reflecting their real contribution over the quarter. It’d be great if someone with direct experience or from the team could clarify the exact criteria used for selection. Looking forward to learning more!

Combined Selected Alpha Performance (CSAP) is calculated using a subset of your alphas that are actively chosen for combos throughout the quarter. It’s not limited to a single region but represents alphas that consistently provide value across different pools and are selected more frequently by the system or researchers. In that sense, CSAP focuses more on actual contribution rather than just raw IR.

The concept of Combined Selected Alpha Performance (CSAP) reflects a more nuanced layer of alpha evaluation that goes beyond individual metrics like IR or Sharpe. From a technical perspective, alphas chosen for CSAP are typically those that contribute positively and consistently to ensemble alpha combos during a given quarter. These are likely filtered through internal selection models that weigh factors such as orthogonality, cross-universe applicability, regime robustness, and interaction effects with other alphas. Region is not a limiting factor; what matters more is cross-sectional contribution and persistence across test environments. Additionally, the CSAP metric may incorporate the frequency of alpha selection across multiple combo runs and the realized performance within those combinations, emphasizing utility over standalone performance. For those aiming to boost CSAP inclusion, it's important to focus on submitting alphas with lower correlation to existing pools, strong out-of-sample behavior, and clear signal logic that generalizes across universes.

Thank you so much for raising this insightful question and to everyone who contributed to the discussion. Understanding how alphas are selected for Combined Selected Alpha Performance is crucial not only for optimizing our submission strategy but also for grasping how our contributions support broader portfolio goals. It’s encouraging to see how this metric is not solely about achieving high IRs but about creating alphas that have actual downstream utility. The clarification that CSAP favors alphas chosen for real combo use — rather than raw leaderboard performance — is especially helpful. I appreciate how this thread invites deeper transparency into the mechanics of alpha contribution. It motivates us to think more holistically about the value our alphas deliver in real-world conditions. Looking forward to learning more from everyone here and refining my approach accordingly.

Thanks for bringing up this important question! From what I understand, the Combined Selected Alpha Performance highlights the alphas that have actually been chosen for combos, showcasing their true impact over the quarter. It would be really helpful if someone with firsthand experience or insights from the team could shed light on the specific selection criteria. Eager to learn more from the community!

The Combined Selected Alpha Performance (CSAP) metric highlights a more sophisticated layer of alpha evaluation that moves beyond conventional standalone measures like Sharpe or Information Ratio. Rather than focusing solely on individual performance, CSAP emphasizes how well an alpha integrates into ensemble combinations — rewarding consistency, orthogonality, and contribution to broader portfolio robustness. Alphas selected for CSAP inclusion are likely chosen based on how frequently they are picked in combo generation runs and how effectively they improve the performance of multi-alpha strategies across regions and regimes. Importantly, CSAP is not bound by region or category; what matters is how the alpha behaves cross-sectionally and whether it holds up under diverse market conditions. To improve CSAP relevance, one should prioritize signals that generalize well, demonstrate low correlation with existing pools, and maintain strong out-of-sample performance. Ultimately, CSAP encourages a shift in mindset—from building high-scoring signals to engineering alphas that deliver persistent value when combined.

What strategies have you found most effective for ensuring your alphas remain orthogonal and consistently selected in ensemble combos?

### **Key Criteria for Selecting Alphas in Combined Performance**

1. **Sharpe Ratio (Overall and Subuniverse):**
   Alphas must demonstrate a strong  **overall Sharpe** , and often a  **subuniverse Sharpe**  (like region-specific) that is at least  **70%**  of the overall Sharpe to ensure robustness across different groups.
2. **Low Turnover:**
   Alphas with  **lower turnover**  are preferred as they reduce transaction costs and market impact, unless the strategy is designed to be high-frequency.
3. **Low Correlation with Existing Alphas:**
   New alphas should add  **diversification** , not redundancy. The  **correlation matrix**  is used to select alphas that are  **uncorrelated**  or negatively correlated with others already in the pool.
4. **Region or Universe Constraint:**
   Some systems group alphas by  **region**  (e.g., USA, ASI, EUR) and select the best ones  **per region**  to avoid overfitting to one market. In other setups, the best alphas are picked globally regardless of region.
5. **Stability Over Time:**
   Selection prefers alphas with  **consistent performance across different time slices**  (e.g., month-by-month) rather than one that performed great only in a single period.
6. **Factor Neutralization Compliance:**
   Alphas that respect  **RAM neutralization**  (avoiding overexposure to momentum, reversion, or price) are favored for long-term stability.
7. **Capacity and Liquidity Constraints:**
   If the alpha trades illiquid stocks or scales poorly, it might be rejected even if performance is good.
8. **Statistical Significance:**
   Alphas are backtested on out-of-sample data and are required to pass statistical significance thresholds (like t-stats).

Thanks for initiating this valuable discussion on Combined Selected Alpha Performance (CSAP). It’s becoming clear that CSAP isn't about just submitting high IR alphas, but rather about how well an alpha integrates into ensemble strategies across different universes and conditions. The focus is on real-world contribution—alphas that are actually selected for combos and that consistently add value through orthogonality, robustness, and low correlation. It’s a great reminder to design alphas not just for leaderboard performance but for broader utility. This thread really helps clarify the mindset shift required for long-term alpha relevance.
