Hello World Quant Brain Community!

I’m curious to hear your thoughts on how to increase CAP (Combined Alpha Performance) and CSAP (Combined Selected Alpha Performance). My performance has declined exponentially from 3.53 to 1.75 in just one quarter, and I’m looking for ways to turn things around. Any tips or strategies you’ve found helpful in improving these metrics would be greatly appreciated.

Effective diversification helps smooth out volatility and enhance performance by mitigating individual asset risk. Here's how diversification can boost both CAP and CSAP:

**Reduce Concentration Risk** : Ensure your portfolio is not overly concentrated in one asset or sector. A diversified mix will reduce the chances of an underperforming asset severely dragging down your alpha.

These indicators now incorporate the after cost factor, so in addition to optimizing alpha OS performance, it is necessary to optimize alpha liquidity such as turnover, long count, short count. Focusing on regions such as GLB, USA is probably also a good idea.

To boost your Combined Alpha Performance (CAP) and Combined Selected Alpha Performance (CSAP), consider implementing a more diversified approach to your portfolio. Reducing concentration risk by ensuring a balanced mix of assets across different sectors can help mitigate the impact of any single underperforming asset. Additionally, optimizing for liquidity factors like turnover and long/short counts is crucial, especially since these metrics now account for transaction costs. Focusing on regions with higher liquidity, such as GLB and the USA, can also enhance your overall performance. Exploring these strategies may help you regain momentum in your metrics.

Boost CAP & CSAP by improving IC, Sharpe, and returns. Reduce alpha correlation, optimize selection, and use risk controls like neutralization to enhance stability. Avoid overfitting and monitor trends!

I've also been struggling to improve this metric. After a few updates, my CAP and CSAP scores have dropped from above 2.0 to below 1.0. Hopefully, someone will come up with a good idea to help improve this criterion.

The game’s tougher now since CAP and CSAP factor in transaction costs. Just optimizing alpha isn’t enough anymore — you gotta check liquidity too, like turnover and long/short counts. Focusing on regions like the USA or GLB might give you a better edge!

Boosting  **Combined Alpha Performance (CAP)**  and  **Combined Selected Alpha Performance (CSAP)**  involves optimizing your strategy to generate more alpha (excess returns) while managing risk effectively. Both CAP and CSAP are important metrics for measuring how well a strategy or portfolio is performing relative to a benchmark, but they differ in their approach.

Use  `corr_matrix`  or  `cluster_id`  to check signal overlap. Aim for alphas that bring diverse styles (e.g., momentum, reversion, volatility-normalized, turnover-controlled).

Diversify styles. Prioritize stable performers. Normalize or adapt alphas. Control turnover. Learn from past CSAP picks.

Hi  [SK95162](/hc/en-us/profiles/23496019416727-SK95162) ,

In addition to what others have said, one crucial step is to analyze your own submitted alphas, especially those which have very low or negative Sharpe in the updated OS period in the submitted alphas tab. From my own experience, I have found that certain combinations of datasets and regions do not do well in certain market conditions and hence cause a performance drop in OS, even when I have done everything that is suggested for robustness.

For such alphas, I learn what went wrong, which are the problematic regions and data fields and develop a strategy for future alphas. And integrate these in my frameworks.

Hi  [SK95162](/hc/en-us/profiles/23496019416727-SK95162) ,

Thank you! I am sure we can learn a lot from each other on the forum itself. So if you have any particular question, please ask here on the forum. I will try my best to answer it here, which may be useful for others here too.

Cheers!

Diversify styles, focus on stable performers, normalize/adapt alphas, control turnover, and learn from past CSAP picks.

Pay attention to the stability of your alphas across different OS windows. A useful tactic is to track signal decay and identify which alphas are robust in out-of-sample versus those that degrade quickly. Consistently updating your selection process based on OS performance metrics helps filter noise and improve CSAP.

I think it's important to implement ideas that are practically tradable, with a balanced long count and short count ratio. Make sure the alpha’s turnover doesn’t exceed 30%, because even if the performance is high, I’ve observed that CAP and CSAP still tend to drop when turnover is too high.

Diversify your portfolio, optimize liquidity, and focus on high-liquidity regions to boost CAP and CSAP while reducing concentration and transaction risks.

Boosting CAP and CSAP in the post-2025Q1 landscape requires a dual focus on  **alpha quality**  and  **cost-aware construction** . While improving IC and Sharpe is still foundational, recent changes mean that  **liquidity metrics** —especially  **turnover** ,  **long/short balance** , and  **region selection** —are now just as critical. I’ve had success using  **cluster analysis**  (e.g.,  `cluster_id`  or PCA decomposition) to ensure that selected alphas offer style and structural diversity. For CSAP, I regularly backtest signal subsets using  **rolling OS windows**  to identify decay-prone patterns. Also, be cautious of redundant combinations;  **correlation matrices**  or  `generate_stats()`  output can reveal hidden overlap that reduces effective contribution. CAP is no longer just about strong signals—it’s about strong synergy under constraints.
