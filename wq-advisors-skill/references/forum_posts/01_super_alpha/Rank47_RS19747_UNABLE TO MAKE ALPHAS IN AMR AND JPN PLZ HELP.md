Hi,You can easily create alphas in Analyst, Fundamental, Model, Risk, PV dataset categories. It is much easier in creating alphas in these categories.

Hi,You can Try making alphas by mixing model, fundamental, risk, price volume, analyst data using simple time-series operator like average, rank.

check on mdl250  datasets and oth175 datasets

Hi 顾问 RS19747 (Rank 47),You can start by exploring theModel, Analyst, Fundamental, Risk, and PV datasetsfor AMR and JPN. A good approach is tocombine different data sources(e.g., mdl250, oth175, price, volume, analyst ratings) withsimple time-series operatorslikets_mean,ts_rank, orts_decay.Tip: Start withsmall, straightforward alphasusing one or two fields first, test them, and then gradually build more complexity. This helps avoid errors and ensures your alphas are valid across the datasets.

Creating effective alphas in AMR and JPN can be challenging because both regions have unique market structures, liquidity profiles, and trading calendars. For AMR, corporate actions, earnings release timings, and sector-specific seasonality often influence signal behavior. In JPN, you have to account for midday breaks, different holiday schedules, and the prevalence of certain trading patterns like “morning gap” effects. I suggest starting with a robust data preprocessing pipeline — align timestamps to each region’s local trading hours, adjust for splits/dividends, and ensure proper handling of missing data. You can use sector-neutralization and country-neutralization to avoid regional bias. If you’re looking for a starting point, try adapting your existing alpha templates by incorporating region-specific operators (e.g., ts_delay with region-appropriate lags) and testing them in a smaller, stable sub-universe before scaling. Also, check the WorldQuant documentation for region-specific data limitations — some signals that work in USA or EUR universes may not translate well without modification.
