## 帖子正文

Hi all, i hope to discuss about delay 0 alpha. As far as I know, delay 0 alpha is:

- High turnover (quiet hard to reduce it but keep Sharpe and Fitness)

- More stable than Delay 1 (Hope it can have higher OS and value factor)

- Higher expense so required higher margin

For now, I see than reversal idea, such as '-returns' is work well with this type of alpha. I'm trying to apply momentum idea but it's hard. Anyone know any paper/ idea can work with delay 1 alpha?

Hi TN51777, How do you do your research on D0 alphas? So far I have not been  able to get a submittable D0 alpha in any region. My main challenge being on  how to achieve the higher fitness required.

[TN51777](/hc/en-us/profiles/17875512568599-TN51777)  and  [JO25713](/hc/en-us/profiles/24371865839767-JO25713)

D0 Alphas differ with D1 Alphas mostly in their execution time. D1 Alphas receive information before the market opens, compute the target holding try to match the Alpha position to the target throughout the day. D0 Alphas receives the final information sometime in mid-session, generate the target position and try to match that in a much narrow time window.

Hence, D0 Alphas has shorter execution time -> meaning that it must have higher returns, Sharpe for it to beat cost. You can think of this as if you are in a hurry, you cannot say much about the price. On the other hand, because it waited so long to start generating positions, it is able to use the latest information available. This characteristic makes event-driven Alpha suitable in d0 Alphas.

To sum up, if you haven't work on d0 Alphas, before, think of how you will utilize the latest information to gain extra returns.

Getting started with D0 Alphas can seem daunting, but here are a few tips to guide your research:

1. **Re-simulate Your D1 Alphas:**  Begin by adapting your existing D1 Alphas for D0 settings. Analyze how your models behave with the latest intraday data and modify them to utilize D0-specific fields.
2. **Target Event-Driven Strategies:**  D0 Alphas are particularly well-suited for capturing premiums from events like earnings surprises, M&A announcements, or macroeconomic data releases. Use the  `trade_when`  operator or similar tools to align with these opportunities.
3. **Focus on Liquidity:**  Due to the short execution window, prioritize stocks with high liquidity (e.g., the TOP1000 universe in the USA region). This ensures that your Alpha's positions can be efficiently filled.
4. **Optimize for Higher Turnover:**  D0 Alphas typically have higher turnover. Balance this by aiming for higher Sharpe ratios and returns to offset transaction costs effectively.
5. **Check Robustness:**  Test your Alpha’s performance across various universes and ensure it remains viable when subjected to SubUniverse and SuperUniverse tests. A strong D0 Alpha should also retain some utility in D1 settings.

Starting with these steps will help you better utilize D0’s capacity to react quickly to market events while building robust and high-performing Alphas.

Hi JO25713,

Until now, almost my Delay 0 alphas is reversal idea, I try from example reversal eg -returns then try to reduce its turnover and increase fitness. But as you said, increase fit is quiet challenge so I only try to have enough fitness to submit.

### 评论 #5 (作者: VP87972, 时间: 1年前)

Anyone try to build Delay 0 in Eur region? I tried but it's harder to achieve higher Sharpe in Europe than USA, while turnover still high.

Can you provide some example to reduce turnover? I try to increase decay but it not work.

### 评论 #6 (作者: TN10210, 时间: 1年前)

Have you try Delay 0 in Eur region? it have lower drawdown than USA.

I dont't know why we don't have delay 0 for ASI, since we have delay 0 in CHN, it work for me when building alpha in CHN and EUR

Hi  [VP87972](/hc/en-us/profiles/1533784099601-VP87972) !

To reduce turnover you can try trade_when, if_else, hump, ts_target_tvr_hump operators

Hi TN51777!

> But as you said, increase fit is quiet challenge so I only try to have enough fitness to submit.

If you reduce turnover and as a result the fitness barely passes the threshold, it might increase the probability that the alpha will perform poorly in OS. So it's a good idea to keep this in mind!

Hi  [TN10210](/hc/en-us/profiles/21908956565655-TN10210) !

Maybe you could share some alpha ideas on EUR delay 0? I think it would be helpful for all of us.

When you try Delay 0, if use script to run alpha, ensure to set high decay, eg: 8 or more, since we will filter alpha which keep to robustness even lower turnover.

Because Delay-0 Alphas are event-driven, they are designed to react quickly to the latest market information, making them highly suitable for capturing short-term opportunities. These alphas operate within a narrow execution window, relying on the most up-to-date data to generate positions and execute trades efficiently. You can try inst_pnl operator to measure the profit and loss (PnL) at the instrument level in real-time. By utilizing inst_pnl, you can evaluate the performance of individual securities within the strategy, ensuring that the positions are aligned with the desired outcomes.

[PH82915](/hc/en-us/profiles/1532005543462-PH82915)  I tried sometime but almost my signal is price/volume/new data so setting high decay makes my performance down sharply, how can you deal with that problem?

### 评论 #14 (作者: PM26052, 时间: 1年前)

Delay 0 alpha is an interesting topic—thanks for bringing it up! As you mentioned, Delay 0 tends to have high turnover, which makes it challenging to reduce while maintaining Sharpe and Fitness. The fact that it's more stable than Delay 1 is a significant advantage, especially if it leads to better out-of-sample (OS) performance and value factor.

The high expense and margin requirements make it a more demanding alpha to work with, but the potential for stable returns can be worth it. Regarding your experience with reversal ideas like '-returns' working well, this aligns with the nature of Delay 0, where short-term momentum and mean reversion patterns can often fit.

For Delay 1 alphas, adding momentum could be tricky, as they tend to rely on slower-moving signals, making them less responsive to rapid shifts. A good strategy might be to incorporate multi-factor models or add additional volatility or price momentum indicators to capture the necessary trends. If you’re looking for academic research or papers, look for ones on multi-period momentum strategies or time-series momentum, which can provide useful insights for building Delay 1 alphas.

It’s great to see you experimenting with these ideas—definitely a space for growth in Delay 0 alphas! Would love to hear how it goes as you refine the momentum-based approaches.

I tried many ways to do delay1 on delay 0 but failed because the conditions of delay 0 are higher. So I have to find good signals from the beginning.

### 评论 #18 (作者: SJ17125, 时间: 1年前)

Hii,

Delay 0 alphas offer stability and better out-of-sample performance but come with high turnover and margin challenges. They work well with short-term momentum or mean reversion patterns, like '-returns.' For Delay 1 alphas, integrating slower-moving signals, multi-factor models, or volatility indicators could improve trend capture. Exploring research on time-series and multi-period momentum can provide valuable insights. 

I hope it will help.

### 评论 #19 (作者: TN74933, 时间: 1年前)

For delay 1 alphas, consider exploring trend-following models with smoothed signals like  `ts_mean`  or  `ts_decay_linear` . Research on short-term momentum in cross-sectional data or statistical arbitrage models may also provide insights. Strategies blending momentum and mean reversion could be effective too.

Delay 0 alpha is a high-performing type of alpha but comes with high turnover and significant transaction costs. Some optimization approaches include improving reversal signals by incorporating order imbalance or spread, reducing signal noise using smoothing techniques (EMA, Kalman Filter), and enhancing alpha persistence through decay analysis and blending with Delay 1 signals

### 评论 #24 (作者: AS16039, 时间: 1年前)

This has been an insightful discussion on Delay 0 (D0) alphas. I wanted to share some thoughts and explore further ideas:

### **Challenges & Considerations**

- As mentioned, D0 alphas require  **higher returns and Sharpe ratios**  to compensate for transaction costs and short execution windows.
- **High turnover**  is a natural consequence, making cost control essential.
- **Event-driven strategies**  seem to be the best fit, leveraging the latest available information.

### **Possible Approaches**

1. **Refining Reversal Strategies:**
   - Simple reversal (-returns) works, but has anyone experimented with  **order flow imbalance**  or  **spread-based reversal** ?
   - Would using  **intraday liquidity metrics**  (VWAP, depth imbalance) help improve robustness?
2. **Momentum in D0 Alphas:**
   - Since short-term momentum is tricky due to execution speed, has anyone tried  **adaptive trend models**  (e.g., Kalman filters, Bayesian updating)?
   - Could a combination of  **volatility-adjusted signals**  and  **intraday microstructure features**  improve momentum-based D0 alphas?
3. **Reducing Turnover Without Hurting Fitness:**
   - **Decay tuning**  helps, but in some cases,  **hump functions (ts_target_tvr_hump)**  might provide a smoother transition.
   - Can  **conditional execution rules (trade_when, if_else)**  be effectively used to reduce churn while maintaining predictive strength?
4. **Cross-Regional Performance Differences:**
   - It seems like EUR D0 alphas are harder to optimize compared to the US. Any insights on  **why certain regions exhibit different performance?**
   - Has anyone looked into  **market microstructure differences**  that might impact signal decay across regions?

It's interesting to see how you've highlighted the nuances of delay 0 alpha, particularly regarding its stability compared to delay 1. The concepts of turnover and expense are crucial. I wonder if there are specific metrics or indicators you consider while applying the reversal ideas with this alpha? Also, exploring papers that delve into the synergy of momentum strategies could yield fruitful insights. Would you like recommendations on that?

### 评论 #26 (作者: RB98150, 时间: 1年前)

For Delay 0 alpha, try  **order flow imbalance, bid-ask spread trends, and microstructural momentum** . For Delay 1,  **VWAP trends, closing price momentum, and volatility expansion**  can work. Papers:  *Order Flow & Market Making* ,  *Momentum at High-Frequencies* .

### 评论 #27 (作者: JB26214, 时间: 1年前)

Delay 0: Use order flow imbalance, bid-ask spreads, microstructural momentum. Delay 1: VWAP, closing price momentum, volatility.
