If you rely solely on news data, achieving strong performance will be challenging due to its high volatility and weak predictive power across most data fields. Based on my experience, combining news data with price and volume data can significantly improve performance. Additionally, price and volume often serve as key indicators for identifying trends when news events occur.

The first step is to understand the dataset. When working with a news dataset, you can apply the following operators to effectively transform it into an alpha:

- **vec_avg** : Computes the average of signal vectors (e.g., sentiment scores from headlines or news content).
- **ts_sum** : Aggregates (cumulates) signals over a specified period to smooth out fluctuations.
- **ts_delta** : Measures the change (difference) between time periods, useful for detecting sudden shifts in news sentiment.
- **rank/ts_rank** : Ranks signals based on value (cross-sectionally or over time) to normalize data and compare across stocks.
- **trade_when** : Combines signals based on conditions, triggering trades when a predefined threshold is met, reducing turnover.

For example, if the neutralization techniques are incorporated into the alpha and prevent the system from recognizing the reversion behavior (e.g., by using smoothing or other methods), the system may no longer flag reversion components as a concern.

### 评论 #10 (作者: TP72942, 时间: 1年前)

You should use time-series related operators. For example:

- `ts_mean(data, 5)`  to observe the trend of data over 5 days.
- `ts_delta(data, 5)`  to track short-term changes in news.
- `ts_zscore(data, 20)`  to identify events with significant volatility.
- `rank(ts_sentiment(news_data))`  to rank stocks based on the impact of news, helping to identify the stocks that react most strongly to recent news.

- Historical stock prices for Chinese companies or indices.
- Macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth, interest rates, and inflation in China.
- Alternative datasets such as social media sentiment or news articles that could provide signals about market movements.
- Technical indicators like moving averages, volatility indices, and momentum metrics.

Getting started with news datasets for alpha creation can be a game-changer! Begin by identifying reliable sources like financial news outlets or aggregators. You can use natural language processing (NLP) to extract key information, like sentiment, frequency of mentions, or specific events. A simple template might start by collecting headlines, classifying sentiment, and correlating it with price movements. Have you considered using sentiment analysis or event detection to create features from news articles?

Many have suggested using time-series operators such as  `ts_mean()` ,  `ts_delta()` , and  `ts_zscore()` . A practical extension would be to implement rolling-window techniques to detect sentiment shifts over different time horizons. For example, comparing a short-term 5-day moving average of sentiment with a longer 30-day average can highlight deviations that might signal upcoming price movements.

Social media datasets, including  **sentiment scores, tweet volume, and news sentiment** , offer valuable insights but require careful processing due to noise and time sensitivity.

#### **1️⃣ Understanding Key Data Fields**

- **Sentiment Score**  – Measures the tone of discussions.
- **Tweet Volume**  – Tracks stock mentions, detecting spikes in interest.
- **Sentiment Z-Score**  – Normalized sentiment deviations for anomaly detection.

#### **2️⃣ Regional Considerations (EUR, USA, ASI, GLB)**

- **USA & EUR**  – Higher social media coverage; stronger sentiment-driven reactions.
- **ASI**  – Less data but localized news may drive movements.
- **GLB**  – Broadest coverage, but regional effects may be diluted.

#### **3️⃣ Alpha Construction & Template**

- **Preprocess Data**  – Normalize and filter noise (e.g., bots, spam).
- **Feature Engineering**  – Use rolling averages to smooth trends.
- **Alpha Example** :  `Rank(TS_Mean(SocialMediaSentiment, 5) - TS_Mean(SocialMediaSentiment, 30))`
- **Backtest & Validate**  – Test different timeframes to ensure robustness.

🔹  **Tip:**  Align sentiment shifts with market data for better predictive power. Keep refining and optimizing! 🚀

Extracting alpha from news and social media is powerful but requires careful processing to manage noise and time sensitivity. Key fields include sentiment scores, tweet volumes, and sentiment Z-scores for anomaly detection. Regionally, USA & EUR often show stronger sentiment-driven market reactions, while ASI is influenced by localized news, and GLB offers broader but diluted signals.

Effective strategies involve filtering spam/bots and normalizing trends. Feature engineering like rolling averages smooths sentiment fluctuations. A sample alpha:
 `Rank(TS_Mean(SocialMediaSentiment, 5) - TS_Mean(SocialMediaSentiment, 30))` 
captures short-term sentiment shifts.

Always backtest across timeframes and align sentiment with market data for better predictive power. Have you explored alternative sentiment models or extraction techniques for deeper insights?
