**Hello everyone,**

In this article, I will share how to create alpha using only a few datafields.

### The necessity of alpha with fewer datafields:

As you may know, WorldQuant's recent Genius program considers the "Fields per Alpha" criterion when ranking consultants. Therefore, alphas using only 1 to 2 datafields can be highly useful in improving your score for this criterion.

### How did I create such alphas?

**Step 1: Data Exploration** 
In this step, I selected the datasets I wanted to build alphas from and performed an initial simulation on the platform.

**Step 2: Selecting better-performing alphas & applying operators** 
I filtered datafields showing promising results based on basic metrics such as Sharpe, fitness, returns, drawdown, margin, etc. Then, I applied mathematical operators around these datafields and continued simulating. This step can be repeated multiple times until the alpha performs as best as possible.

**Step 3: Combining with other signals** 
After identifying well-performing alphas in step 2, you can combine them with signals from other datafields to further enhance performance.

**Note:**  This approach is more suitable for automated alpha generation.

This was my experience from last year’s MAPC competition (the single-datafield alpha contest), and I hope it can help you improve your "Fields per Alpha" score. If you have a different approach, feel free to share so we can all achieve the Genius ranking we aim for!

**Wishing you all a productive and joyful workday!**

Thank you for sharing your approach on creating alphas with fewer datafields. It's great to see how focusing on just one or two datafields can help improve the "Fields per Alpha" score, which is crucial for the Genius ranking. Your method of data exploration, followed by the selection of well-performing alphas and the application of mathematical operators, seems like an effective way to maximize performance.

Thank you for sharing this insightful approach to creating alphas with fewer datafields! Your step-by-step breakdown is clear and practical, especially for those aiming to improve their "Fields per Alpha" score in the Genius program.

I appreciate how you emphasized data exploration and iterative refinement of operators in Step 2. Combining well-performing signals in Step 3 is a great tip to further enhance alpha performance while maintaining simplicity.

One question: Have you noticed any specific types of operators or combinations that consistently perform well for single or dual-datafield alphas? It would be interesting to hear your thoughts or examples!

Thanks again for sharing, and wishing you continued success on your Genius journey! 🚀

[AC63290](/hc/en-us/profiles/13665148618903-AC63290)  On answering your question: "Have you noticed any specific types of operators or combinations that consistently perform well for single or dual-datafield alphas?", I would like to state that there is no operator-for-all approach. The only way to work out alphas with good performance is to understand individual signals thoroughly, and this would help in diversifying your alpha pool as well. However, I found out that there are particular scenarios when it comes to improving an alpha performance: turnover handling and weight concentration. From my experience, ts_backfill, group_backfill, ts_decay_exp_window, and winsorize are very helpful in lower turnover. I hope my answer helps.

Hi  [TL16324](/hc/en-us/profiles/18515896113175-TL16324)

Thanks for sharing your process for creating alphas with fewer data fields—really insightful! I’m curious, though: how do you keep your alphas robust and performing well when you’re working with such a limited number of fields? Do you have any tips or tricks for balancing simplicity with strong results?
Also, what kinds of fields do you often combine for better performance? Are there any specific types of data fields or patterns you’ve found particularly useful when working within these constraints?

[TL16324](/hc/en-us/profiles/18515896113175-TL16324)   Thanks for sharing your process of creating alphas with less data fields,I use to make alpha in multiple datasets.Therefore field per alpha is high. Now I will try to make alpha using single dataset to reduce field per alpha.

### 评论 #10 (作者: NT63388, 时间: 1 year ago)

Thank you for sharing.
In my case, I try to use Datafields within the same Dataset (Single characteristic).
I hope everyone finds a strategy that suits their own approach.

A heartfelt thank you for providing such a clear and actionable guide on creating alphas using minimal datafields. Your step-by-step approach, drawn from firsthand experience in the MAPC competition, is not only insightful but also incredibly relevant for those aiming to excel in the Genius program.

However one should also keep in mind that the usage of less fields should not compromise with the quality of the alphas.

Thanks

Optimizing the Fields per Alpha metric not only makes your Alpha shorter but also ensures its concept is more coherent and refined.
I believe this aligns with Brain's objective in incorporating this criterion into the Genius program, making it one of the most challenging benchmarks to meet.

Moreover, achieving a low  **Fields per Alpha**  combined with a low **Operators per Alpha**  often correlates with reaching Master or Grand Master levels.

These two tie-break criteria were also significant factors that limited me to the Expert level in the Genius Q4/2024 results.

Thanks for sharing! To reduce Fields per Alpha, we can select datafields with strong signals based on Information Coefficient, reuse them through transformations like rank, delta, decay, and apply techniques such as Sparse Regression or Genetic Algorithms for optimization. Additionally, leveraging simple operators like rank(), ts_mean() helps create effective alphas without requiring many datafields.
