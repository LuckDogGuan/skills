The simulation universe consists of the set of stocks to evaluate. BRAIN provides standard universes like TOP3000, TOP2000, TOP1000, etc. within each region.

The TOP-N universes are comprised of N stocks of that region with the highest average dollar volume over the past three months. For example, in the top liquid universes, TOP3000 is a set of 3,000 stocks with highest liquidity; TOP2000 is a set of 2,000 stocks with highest liquidity; and so on. TOP2000 is a subset of TOP3000 stocks.

**Tip** : Larger universes include less liquid stocks, which have higher transaction costs and market impact of trading. Thus, Alphas in such universes should incorporate weighting (e.g. by market cap or volume) to trade low liquidity stocks less often.

Can you explain why a larger universe gives a larger sharpe? Besides, a larger universe also limits weight concentration.

A larger universe often provides more diversification, which can improve the Sharpe ratio by spreading risk across a broader set of stocks, while also limiting weight concentration by reducing the reliance on a few highly liquid stocks—do you think this trade-off justifies the additional complexity in managing less liquid assets?

Hello, I read in the payment increase method that it is recommended to submit alpha in a larger universe, however, some articles recommend sub alpha in a more liquid universe for a robust signal. So how should I submit to balance?

When choosing between a larger universe and a more liquid one, consider the trade-offs: larger universes offer diversification and potentially a higher Sharpe ratio due to risk spreading, but they include less liquid stocks with higher transaction costs. More liquid universes may provide robust signals with lower market impact but may lack diversification. To balance, you might submit alphas in both types of universes to leverage their respective strengths, managing the complexity with careful weighting strategies and risk management.

There is a way to give more weight to stocks with higher liquidity, which is to multiply by the volume factor or neutralize by liquidity factors.

The explanation of simulation universes and their liquidity-based composition is clear and practical. Highlighting the trade-offs between universe size and transaction costs is valuable. Including examples of how weighting by market cap or volume can mitigate risks in less liquid stocks would further enhance the practical utility of this guidance.

Larger universes, like TOP3000, include stocks with lower liquidity, which can increase transaction costs and market impact. To mitigate this, you can use weighting techniques, such as market cap or volume, to trade less frequently with less liquid stocks. This helps to reduce trading costs while maintaining the performance of your Alpha strategy.
