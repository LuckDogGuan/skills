Hi, I have an alpha with an IS Ladder Sharpe of 1.58, but it shows as being below the cutoff of 1.58 in the ASI and GLB regions. Could you explain this error and suggest how I can resolve it? Thank you!

By addressing these potential issues, you should be able to align the Sharpe ratios across the different regions and better understand why your alpha is showing differently in the ASI and GLB regions.

Hi  [TN74933](/hc/en-us/profiles/21997837037719-TN74933) ,

Thank you for the question! I hope this helps.

The value of 1.58 is the cut-off value. Your IS ladder Sharpe should be > 1.58. It is not sufficient to have IS ladder Sharpe >= 1.58. And this is not region specific. Different regions and types of alpha have different cut-offs.

It's great that you're using operators like max and min, as they can be very effective in many situations for smoothing performance metrics. However, as you've pointed out, this approach may not be suitable for Alphas with low data volatility, which presents a unique challenge.

The IS Ladder Sharpe cutoff might vary slightly due to region-specific adjustments or dataset differences. Ensure your alpha is properly neutralized for market and sector biases in ASI and GLB regions. Validate with region-focused backtests to confirm Sharpe alignment and check if transaction costs or scaling distort calculations.

Hi TN74933,

I totally understand your confusion regarding the IS Ladder Sharpe. As a traditional finance researcher trying to navigate this new quant landscape, I often find that what appears straightforward can be nuanced. The Sharpe ratio must be greater than 1.58 across all original metrics, and slight regional variances in cut-offs can lead to unexpected results. When I work on my alphas, I ensure they are fully neutralized for market influences to avoid these discrepancies. Exploring various backtesting scenarios is essential since they reveal critical performance shifts. Keep pushing your boundaries; it's all part of the learning curve in this dynamic field!

IS Ladder Sharpe can vary across different regions due to variations in market conditions or data distributions. Have you tested using region-weighted aggregation to balance performance across ASI and GLB

Alpha can be influenced by various factors, such as different investment strategies in each region, changes in input factors like market volatility and macroeconomic conditions, as well as the unique market structure of each region. These differences can lead to discrepancies in alpha values and impact the Sharpe ratio. To address this, the alpha model should be adjusted to align with the specific conditions of each region.

Regional variations in IS Ladder Sharpe can arise due to market structure differences, data distribution, and factor exposures. Ensure your alpha is neutralized for market and sector biases, and validate with region-focused backtests. Consider region-weighted aggregation and check for scaling or transaction cost impacts.

IS Ladder Sharpe variations may come from market structure differences, factor exposures, or transaction costs. Try region-specific adjustments and targeted backtests to align performance.

It sounds like you're facing confusion with the IS Ladder Sharpe calculation and its implications in the ASI and GLB regions. Have you checked the underlying data inputs or any potential adjustments in your model? Sometimes minor discrepancies in inputs can lead to unexpected results. It may also help to reach out for technical support or look into any documentation available for these metrics.
