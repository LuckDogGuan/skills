I think why doesn't Brain create a data table that predicts Genius level for a quarter by day?

I think that will help consultants know their ranking on the leaderboard to have improvement strategies until the end of the quarter and also increase the competitiveness of Genius.

I completely agree with your idea. Having a data table that updates Genius level predictions by day would be incredibly helpful for consultants. It would provide better visibility into how our daily contributions and performance are affecting our overall ranking. This kind of transparency could help everyone stay more motivated and competitive throughout the quarter. It would also allow us to identify what factors are helping or hurting our progress and adjust our strategy in real time. I believe this feature would significantly increase user engagement and help consultants make smarter decisions. Thanks for bringing this up — it’s definitely a suggestion worth implementing by the Brain team.

Actually, although this feature isn't explicitly displayed, the number of submitted alphas, combined performance, and pyramids of each advisor can be found. Perhaps the official platform encourages us to explore independently. If the feature you mentioned is officially opened, the advisors above have already listed its advantages. Now, let me discuss potential issues:

First, it might lead all advisors to submit alphas solely for the "Genius" status. Since Genius rewards alphas with fewer operators, there's a high risk of underfitting. For example, an alpha like  `ts_delta(close, 5)`  with a Sharpe ratio of 1.58 and fitness of 1 meets the submission criteria—it uses only one field and one operator. However, if we optimize it with  `hump_decay(group_rank(ts_delta(close, 5), subindustry), ...)`  by adding two more operators, its Sharpe ratio increases to 2 and fitness to 1.5. This optimization, without overfitting, makes the factor more robust. But if everyone pursues Genius, they may choose simpler alphas to minimize operators/fields, resulting in a flood of underfitted alphas—likely not the outcome the platform intends.

That's a good suggestion, and I see the value in having such a metric. However, it's important to remember that this is just an  **indicator** , not something that should require a large amount of data or complex logic to build. If we overemphasize this kind of metric, we risk  **overfitting**  or  **misinterpreting signals** , especially when the inputs are limited or vary in quality.

The goal should be to provide helpful guidance—not to create a system that drives reactive or overly tactical behavior. Metrics are useful when they give direction, but they can be counterproductive if people start chasing the number rather than focusing on long-term, meaningful improvement.

### 评论 #15 (作者: NP85445, 时间: 1年前)

100% agree. It's tough to know if your current strategy is even working until it's too late. Seeing a daily trend, even if it's just a small arrow pointing up or down, would be a huge help in figuring out whether to stay the course or pivot.

A daily-updated Genius level projection table would be a fantastic addition to the BRAIN platform. It would bring greater clarity to where each consultant stands during the quarter and show how close they are to reaching the next tier. This real-time visibility could help guide strategic decisions, such as where to focus alpha submissions or how to adjust tie-breaker metrics like operator diversity or simulation streaks. Not only would it motivate consultants to stay active, but it could also foster a healthy sense of competition and progress. Including momentum indicators or recent performance trends would make the leaderboard more dynamic and insightful. A tool like this would empower consultants to self-evaluate, plan ahead, and optimize contributions more effectively. Overall, it’s a simple yet impactful way to enhance engagement, transparency, and goal alignment across the Genius community.

What features would you want to see in such a projection table—just raw scores, or also growth trends and peer comparisons?

A  **daily-updated Genius level projection table**  would indeed be a game-changer for the BRAIN platform, offering both motivation and strategic clarity. Beyond just displaying current scores or tier proximity, such a table could unlock a whole new layer of transparency and engagement.

Here are a few features I’d recommend for maximizing its usefulness:

- **Projected Level Progression** : A visual tracker showing how close you are to the next tier, updated daily.
- **Momentum Indicators** : Highlight recent gains in Genius metrics (e.g., rising simulation success rate, operator diversity score).
- **Peer Benchmarks** : Anonymous percentile comparisons showing where you stand relative to others at your level.
- **Submission Impact Breakdown** : A summary of how recent alpha submissions contributed to score changes (e.g., Genius score, OP/Alpha).
- **Tie-Breaker Health Score** : Color-coded indicators for areas like streaks, operator use, and field count efficiency.

These elements would help consultants not only track their standing but also make informed, data-driven decisions.
What would be most valuable for you: knowing where you rank today, or seeing how your performance is trending over time?

Great idea! A daily-updated Genius level table would help consultants track progress, stay motivated, and plan improvements. It adds clarity, boosts competitiveness, and makes reaching the next level more engaging and achievable before quarter-end.

---

### 评论 #20 (作者: NS62681, 时间: 1年前)

Totally agree this would make things much more transparent and help consultants fine-tune their strategies as they go. A daily Genius level preview based on current scores and tie breakers would also make the path forward much clearer.

---

### 评论 #21 (作者: SR82953, 时间: 1年前)

Great idea. I also recommended that at least the  **Combined Alpha Performance**  and  **Combined Selected Alpha Performance**  metrics should be updated weekly or fortnightly. Since these metrics are often updated with a delay (evaluating alphas submitted a month back), it can create an imbalance—rewarding some consultants while discouraging others who might keep working on the same logic without realizing the shift in performance. Regular updates would offer better visibility and strategic direction.

On the Power Pool Leaderboard,  **BC Combo IR**  and  **AC Combo IR**  are two key metrics designed to assess how well your alpha contributes in a portfolio setting.

- **BC Combo IR**  (Backtest Combination Information Ratio) measures the historical contribution of your alpha when added to a broader alpha set during backtesting. A high BC Combo IR indicates that your signal improved the portfolio’s diversification and risk-adjusted performance over past data.
- **AC Combo IR**  (Actual Combination Information Ratio) reflects your alpha’s performance in  *live*  or  *recent*  simulations, based on how it integrates with other selected alphas under current market conditions. It’s a real-time check on practical portfolio value.

Together, these metrics highlight alphas that may not stand out individually but offer strong  **combinatorial value** . To raise these scores, focus on designing  **low-correlation, stable signals**  that interact well with the ensemble—prioritizing synergy over solo performance.

What techniques have you found most effective in boosting combination IRs without sacrificing signal integrity?

In the Power Pool Leaderboard, the metrics BC Combo IR and AC Combo IR are used to measure how well your alpha performs when combined with others in a portfolio context.

BC Combo IR stands for Backtest Combination Information Ratio. It reflects the performance of your alpha when added to a set of other alphas during historical backtesting. A high BC Combo IR indicates that your alpha contributes positively by adding diversification, improving risk-adjusted returns.

AC Combo IR stands for Actual Combination Information Ratio, and it measures how your alpha performs in live or recent simulations within the actual alpha pool. This shows your alpha’s real-world effectiveness and how well it complements others under current market conditions.

These scores help identify alphas that may not rank highest individually but offer strong value when combined. To improve these metrics, focus on creating unique, low-correlation alphas that enhance the diversity of the portfolio.

Absolutely—your vision for a daily-updated Genius level projection table hits the sweet spot between motivation and actionable insight. Beyond raw scores, incorporating features like  **projected level progression** ,  **momentum indicators** , and  **peer benchmarks**  could transform how consultants plan their strategy.

- **Projected Level Progression**  would visually show proximity to the next tier.
- **Momentum Indicators**  could highlight recent gains in metrics like simulation success or operator diversity.
- **Peer Benchmarks**  would provide anonymous percentile comparisons to contextualize your performance.
- **Submission Impact Breakdown**  shows how each new alpha affects your Genius score and OP/Alpha.
- **Tie-Breaker Health Score**  would track streaks, operator usage, and field efficiency at a glance.

This combination of insights lets consultants not just see  **where they rank today** , but also  **how their performance trends over time**  and where to focus next.

Would you prioritize  **trend visibility**  or  **real-time ranking**  if you could only have one?
