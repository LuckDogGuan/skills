## 帖子正文

From various hit and trials I had developed following methodology regarding selection of alphas for PowerPool:

1) Keeping lower turnover alphas (<15%) with sharpe of around 2 or greater is best (in IC).

2) Selecting alphas which has very low Self correlation.

3) High turnover (25-30%) alphas with high sharpe (>2.5) in IC can be considered.

4) If have many alphas in PowerPool untag all high turnover (>20%) ones.

5) Check the performance of the PowerPool using SuperAlpha.

These may help improve PowerPool performance.
Do add your methods of improving the PowerPool.

Great insight. I also prioritize power-pool alphas with a high 2-year Sharpe ratio for better out-of-sample performance. Remember that the main purpose of power-pool alphas is quick idea validation, so don’t submit low-quality alphas just because they meet the power-pool criteria.

Your methodology for selecting alphas in PowerPool makes solid sense—prioritizing high Sharpe, low turnover, low self-correlation, and validating with SuperAlpha all improve stability. Some researchers also add steps like checking cross-correlation across alphas, ensuring dataset diversity, and avoiding conceptual overlap to build a stronger, more resilient PowerPool.

Totally agree. Low-turnover, high-Sharpe alphas form a solid base, and selectively adding a few high-turnover performers can boost edge without adding noise.

Clear and practical criteria, especially the focus on low self-correlation and validating via SuperAlpha.
Curious if you’ve seen cases where slightly higher turnover but very low cross-correlation still improves overall PowerPool robustness.

Clear and practical criteria, particularly the emphasis on low self-correlation and validation through SuperAlpha. I’m curious whether you’ve observed situations where accepting slightly higher turnover still led to stronger overall PowerPool robustness because the alpha had exceptionally low cross-correlation with existing signals.

Clear and practical approach—balancing turnover, Sharpe, and self-correlation is key. SuperAlpha validation is a smart final check. Thanks for sharing

Great point—I also focus on power-pool alphas with strong 2-year Sharpe for better out-of-sample results. Remember, power-pool alphas are for quick idea validation, so avoid submitting low-quality ones just because they meet the criteria.

This is a very sensible and experience-driven methodology, and it aligns well with how PowerPool is actually evaluated in practice. I particularly agree with your emphasis on  **low turnover, decent Sharpe, and low self-correlation**  as the core foundation. PowerPool performance is highly sensitive to trading costs and redundancy, so alphas with turnover below ~15% and stable IC Sharpe tend to contribute much more consistently than flashy but noisy signals. Your point about selectively allowing higher-turnover alphas only when Sharpe is meaningfully higher (>2.5) is also important—those should be treated as  *satellite contributors* , not the backbone. I also like that you explicitly mention untagging high-turnover alphas when the pool grows; marginal contribution often turns negative once crowding and cost interactions kick in. Using SuperAlpha as a validation step is critical, because it exposes correlation and turnover interactions that individual metrics hide. One additional refinement could be monitoring cross-correlation  *after*  decay alignment, since mismatched horizons can mask true overlap.

The criteria are clear and practical, especially the focus on low self-correlation and validation via SuperAlpha. I’m wondering if you’ve seen cases where tolerating somewhat higher turnover actually improved overall PowerPool robustness, simply because the alpha had extremely low cross-correlation with the existing signal set.

Solid methodology! Prioritizing low-turnover, high-Sharpe, and low self-correlation alphas is key. Using SuperAlpha to validate interactions is smart. I’ve also found that selectively allowing slightly higher-turnover alphas can improve PowerPool robustness if they have very low cross-correlation with existing signals.

That’s a good point—low self-correlation and SuperAlpha validation are definitely key. In practice, I’ve seen cases where a signal with slightly higher turnover can still improve overall PowerPool robustness, particularly if it has very low correlation with the existing alpha set. The added diversification can outweigh the cost of extra trades, as long as turnover remains within manageable limits.

Your approach to choosing alphas for PowerPool is well thought out—focusing on strong Sharpe, controlled turnover, low self-correlation, and validation through SuperAlpha all contribute to greater stability. Many researchers further strengthen their selection process by examining cross-alpha correlations, diversifying datasets, and steering clear of overlapping economic concepts, which helps create a more robust and resilient PowerPool overall.
