## 帖子正文

We have launched a new "EUR D1 Theme" that will be active from 1st March 2025 to 14th March 2025 (2 weeks). During this period, the Quality Factor multiplier will be:

- 1.5X for regular EUR D1 Alphas
- 2X for ATOM EUR D1 Alphas

## **Understanding ATOM -  [Single Dataset Alphas](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/consultant-information/single-dataset-alphas)**

1. Single Dataset Alphas must utilize data fields from only one dataset, with exceptions for the following 6 permitted grouping fields – country, exchange, market, sector, industry and subindustry.
2. The use of inst_pnl() and convert() operators is considered as utilizing the pv1 dataset since these operators rely on pv1 data for calculations.

For more information on multiplier combination, please check the  [Multiplier Rules](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/themes/multiplier-rules)

## **Potential sources of ideas**

We recently introduced the new EUR TOP2500 universe, which covers twice as many instruments as the TOP1200 universe. Check out  [Getting Started with the EUR TOP2500 Universe](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/regions-and-universes/getting-started-eur-top2500-universe)  for more information.

- Try to re-simulate your previous EUR Alphas on this broader universe.
- Using  [ACE API Library](/hc/en-us/articles/20786107171351-Alpha-Creation-Engine-API-library)

```
hf.get_datasets(s, region="EUR", delay =1, universe="TOP2500")
```

- To download EUR data fields from analyst69 dataset:

```
hf.get_datafields(s, region="EUR", delay =1, universe="TOP2500", dataset_id="analyst69")
```

- In function  [ace.generate_alpha](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/brain-api/ace-2023-doc#:~:text=generate_alpha(regular%3A%20str,visualization%3A%20bool%20%3D%20False))  specify region, universe and other parameters:

```
ace.generate_alpha(x, region= "EUR", universe = "TOP2500", delay = 1, neutralization = "CROWDING")
```

## **Understanding the Sub-universe test**

To pass the  [Sub-universe test](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/consultant-information/consultant-submission-tests#sub-universe)  for the TOP2500, you need to meet the following criteria:

TOP1200_Sharpe >= 0.52 * TOP2500_Sharpe

To achieve this, one possible technique is to do double neutralization to assess for liquidity or capitalization. Additionally, you can try to increase performance on the liquid part of your Alpha by increasing its turnover in comparison to the illiquid part.

Example of double neutralization country + liquidity:

```
liq_gr = group_rank(ts_sum(close*volume, 63), country);gr = densify(country)*100 + bucket(liq_gr, range="0,1,0.5");
```

If you have group_cartesian_product operator available:

```
liq_gr = group_rank(ts_sum(close*volume, 63), country);gr = group_cartesian_product(country, bucket(liq_gr, range="0,1,0.5"));
```

## **More concepts that you can explore -  [Visualization Tool](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/consultant-information/visualization-tool)**

Simulate your Alphas with Visualization turned On, to check Alpha Sharpe on different capitalizations:

**Example1.** Performance comes mainly from the bottom 20% of stocks by capitalization, the  **Sub-universe test fail** :


> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> Chart
> Sharpe By Capitalization
> 3
> 2
> 詈
> 0-209
> 20-409
> 40-609
> 60-809
> 80-1009


**Example2.** Improved performance on the 60-80% capitalization bucket, the  **Sub-universe test pass** :


> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> Chart
> Sharpe By Capitalization
> 1.5
> 詈
> 0.5
> 0-209
> 20-409

> 60-809
> 80-1009

### 评论 #2 (作者: TD17989, 时间: 1年前)

Hi, I would like to know if there is any technique to pass the EUR sub universe without using too much op and data

---

### 评论 #3 (作者: AG20578, 时间: 1年前)

Hi HN20653!

From my experience - I prefer to run ACE to find initial signals. I usually run something like

```
x = ts_backfill(field, 62);ts_rank(x, 252)
```

So it is just one field. Then you can further improve the signal.

In case when you are using dataset with large amount of fields, there is a chance that you can find proxy for liquidity or capitalization inside this dataset, as a result getting an ATOM alpha.

Automation just makes it easier.

Hi  [TD17989](/hc/en-us/profiles/13680660215831-TD17989) !

Instead of using the proposed solution above, you can try checking your alpha's performance with different neutralization settings. Analyze how alpha performance changes with changes in other settings.

In general, if an alpha fails the Sub-universe test, it is not worth submitting. However, in the example I showed above, the alpha performs well across all capitalization buckets. The only issue is that its performance is too high in the low-cap bucket.

I'm looking for efficient techniques to pass the EUR sub-universe while minimizing the use of operations and data. Ideally, the approach should leverage simple yet effective transformations, existing factors, or region-specific adjustments to ensure optimal performance without excessive computational complexity. If there are methods that optimize factor design while maintaining stability and relevance in EUR, I’d love to explore them.

Hi  [TT55495](/hc/en-us/profiles/13132630342807-TT55495) !

While an alpha can incorporate data fields from multiple datasets, this approach if not implemented correctly, may potentially lead to overfitting due to the mixing of conflicting signals between datasets.

In contrast, single dataset Alphas maintain homogeneity by using data from only one dataset, making them less prone to overfitting and more robust in their predictions.

Let me clarify, single dataset alpha:

```
group_rank(ts_rank(cashflow_op/liabilities, 252), sector)
```

It combines datafields with the same dataset  [fundamental23](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/fundamental23?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=EUR&universe=TOP1200) and has permitted group field.

There are different datasets available on Brain. Some of this datasets include over 100 fields, among those fields you can find needed fields to implement your idea. Also you can write your own grouping fields by using bucket operator. For example:

```
gr = bucket(rank(assets), range="0,1,0.1")
```

So this one is also a single dataset alpha:

```
gr = bucket(rank(assets), range="0,1,0.1");group_rank(ts_rank(cashflow_op/liabilities, 252), gr)
```

### 评论 #14 (作者: UN28170, 时间: 1年前)

The new "EUR D1 Theme" runs with Quality Factor multipliers of 1.5X for regular EUR D1 Alphas and 2X for ATOM EUR D1 Alphas. ATOM Alphas must use a single dataset, except for six permitted grouping fields. Re-simulating previous EUR Alphas on the expanded EUR TOP2500 universe may yield better results. Use the ACE API to download EUR datasets and generate Alphas with proper region, universe, and neutralization settings. Passing the Sub-universe test requires optimizing Sharpe ratios, using techniques like double neutralization. Leverage visualization tools to assess Alpha Sharpe across capitalizations for enhanced performance.

### 评论 #19 (作者: AG20578, 时间: 1年前)

Hi  [TN41146](/hc/en-us/profiles/16734161359511-TN41146) !

On regions like EUR, GLB, and others you do not need to worry about currencies in simulation, it is handled by the platform. However, you should be mindful of the currencies of data fields, such as fundamental or price-volume (pv) fields, as they might be in different currencies. To manage this, you should normalize the data or use the group_rank function to rank the data within each country or exchange: group_rank(x, country) or group_rank(x, exchange).

WorldQuant BRAIN is a  **quantitative research**  platform where users can develop and test alpha signals—predictive models for financial markets. A  **"Theme"**  in BRAIN represents a structured framework for building alphas, usually focused on a specific market, asset class, or strategy.

For an  **EUR D1 Theme** , your work will involve:

1. **Data Selection**  – Identifying relevant datasets (e.g., price action, macroeconomic indicators, order flow data) specific to  **EUR forex pairs**  or EUR-related securities.
2. **Feature Engineering**  – Developing meaningful factors, such as  **momentum, mean reversion, volatility, carry, sentiment, or macroeconomic trends** .
3. **Alpha Construction**  – Creating mathematical expressions or machine learning models that generate trading signals for  **EUR on a daily (D1) timeframe** .
4. **Backtesting**  – Evaluating historical performance, ensuring the alpha has  **statistical significance**  and isn’t overfitted.
5. **Optimization & Submission**  – Refining signals to improve their predictive power before submitting them for review within the BRAIN ecosystem.

### 评论 #25 (作者: CN44201, 时间: 1年前)

Great! For an  **EUR D1 Theme** , you'll want to design  **features (factors)**  that capture key market behaviors. Here are some factor ideas categorized by strategy type:

### **Momentum-Based Factors**

1. **Price Rate of Change (ROC)** : Measures how fast the EUR price is moving.
   ROC=Pricet−Pricet−nPricet−nROC = \frac{Price_t - Price_{t-n}}{Price_{t-n}}ROC=Pricet−n​Pricet​−Pricet−n​​
   Example: n=10n = 10n=10 days to track medium-term momentum.
2. **Moving Average Crossover** : Compare short-term and long-term moving averages.
   - MAfast=10MA_{fast} = 10MAfast​=10-day
   - MAslow=50MA_{slow} = 50MAslow​=50-day
   - Signal =  **Buy when MAfast>MAslowMA_{fast} > MA_{slow}MAfast​>MAslow​, Sell when MAfast<MAslowMA_{fast} < MA_{slow}MAfast​<MAslow​** .

### **Mean Reversion Factors**

1. **Z-Score of Price** : Checks if EUR is overbought/oversold relative to its mean.
   Z=Pricet−μσZ = \frac{Price_t - \mu}{\sigma}Z=σPricet​−μ​
   - μ\muμ = rolling mean over 20 days
   - σ\sigmaσ = rolling standard deviation
2. **Bollinger Band Reversion** : Measures how far EUR price is from its bands.
   - Signal =  **Buy when price touches lower band, sell when it touches upper band** .

### **Volatility & Risk Factors**

1. **Average True Range (ATR) Change** : Measures volatility shifts.
   ATR=1n∑i=1n(Highi−Lowi)ATR = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (High_i - Low_i)ATR=n1​i=1∑n​(Highi​−Lowi​)
   - Can be used to  **adjust position sizing**  based on risk.
2. **GARCH-Based Volatility Forecast** : Predicts future volatility using past variance.

### **Macro & Fundamental-Based Factors**

1. **Interest Rate Differentials** : Tracks ECB rates vs. other central banks.
   Rate Spread=EUR Interest Rate−USD Interest Rate\text{Rate Spread} = \text{EUR Interest Rate} - \text{USD Interest Rate}Rate Spread=EUR Interest Rate−USD Interest Rate
   - Positive spread favors EUR appreciation.
2. **Inflation Differential** : Compare EU CPI vs. US CPI to assess currency strength.

### **Sentiment & Order Flow Factors**

1. **Commitments of Traders (COT) Positioning** : Tracks institutional EUR futures positioning.
   - If hedge funds are net-long, bullish EUR; net-short, bearish EUR.
2. **Real-Time News Sentiment** : Uses NLP to assess sentiment on EUR-related news.

Developing effective ATOM Alphas requires clear steps: identify early signals, refine strategies, and boost performance. When optimizing EUR sub-universe tests, reduce unnecessary operators and data fields while keeping signal integrity intact. Use visualization tools to analyze Alpha Sharpe across capitalization segments and apply best practices for performance evaluation.

The EUR D1 Theme is both challenging and inspiring. While single datasets in ATOM Alphas may seem limiting, they offer a chance to focus deeply on quality. The complexity of sub-universe tests encourages innovative thinking and strategy refinement.

How can we streamline the sub-universe testing process without compromising alpha performance? What are the best techniques for balancing alpha quality and quantity in this context?

### 评论 #27 (作者: AS77213, 时间: 1年前)

The EUR D1 Theme outlines a strategy for generating and optimizing EUR-based Alpha models, with specific multipliers for regular and ATOM Alphas. The focus is on using appropriate datasets, optimizing performance using techniques like double neutralization, and passing the Sub-universe test to ensure robust results. Additionally, leveraging tools like the ACE API and visualization methods helps assess and improve model performance across various market segments. This structured approach is designed to maximize the effectiveness of Alpha models in predicting European market trends.

### 评论 #28 (作者: KK81152, 时间: 1年前)

re-simulate alpha using EUR2500, calculate sharp ratio for both TOP2500 and TOP1200 and apply double neutralization (country and liquidity) for better performance.

---

### 评论 #29 (作者: SY65468, 时间: 1年前)

The EUR D1 Theme aims to optimize Alpha performance by refining signals through dataset analysis and using ACE for initial signal generation. Regular EUR D1 Alphas have a 1.5X Quality Factor multiplier, while ATOM EUR D1 Alphas use a 2X multiplier, with ATOM Alphas limited to a single dataset and six allowed grouping fields. To pass the EUR Sub-universe test without excessive data and operations, it’s better to adjust neutralization settings instead of forcing an Alpha. Re-running past EUR Alphas on the expanded EUR TOP2500 universe could improve results, while leveraging double neutralization and visualization tools to evaluate Alpha Sharpe across different capitalizations can enhance Sharpe ratios and overall performance.

### 评论 #31 (作者: DK20528, 时间: 1年前)

I'm also working on building alphas in EUR region, but my sub-universe Sharpe is just barely passing. Still trying to improve it! Does anyone have any suggestions on how to enhance it?"

---

### 评论 #32 (作者: 顾问 HY90970 (Rank 54), 时间: 1年前)

In TOP2500 universe, lot of alphas maybe submittable with sub-universe test fail.

Then,

1. try to create groups using densify, group_cartesian, bucket followed by group_neutralization/rank/zscore.

2. Try to reduce sharpe so that sub universe cutoff can be met.

---

### 评论 #33 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 1年前)

This EUR D1 Theme presents a unique opportunity to optimize alpha strategies with a higher Quality Factor multiplier, especially leveraging the newly introduced EUR TOP2500 universe. Given that TOP2500 covers a broader set of instruments, it is crucial to reassess existing EUR D1 alphas for scalability and robustness across a wider liquidity spectrum.

A key challenge is ensuring Sub-universe test compliance, requiring TOP1200 Sharpe to maintain at least 52% of the TOP2500 Sharpe. Double neutralization techniques, such as combining country and liquidity factors (e.g.,  `group_cartesian_product(country, bucket(liq_gr, range="0,1,0.5"))` ), can help mitigate performance concentration in illiquid stocks. Turnover analysis also becomes critical, as increasing turnover in liquid segments can balance the illiquid bias.

For ATOM EUR D1 alphas, the 2X multiplier makes single dataset approaches more attractive, but they must adhere strictly to dataset limitations. Special attention should be given to permitted grouping fields (country, exchange, market, sector, industry, subindustry) and constraints around  `inst_pnl()`  and  `convert()` .

Finally, incorporating Visualization tools can help diagnose capitalization biases. If performance is concentrated in the bottom 20% of stocks, strategic adjustments—such as refining factor exposure to mid-cap stocks—can improve sub-universe stability.

---

### 评论 #34 (作者: UK75871, 时间: 1年前)

To streamline sub-universe testing without compromising alpha performance, focus on the following:

1. **Simplify Data** : Reduce unnecessary data fields and operators, prioritizing only the most impactful features to maintain signal integrity.
2. **Refine Signals** : Focus on early, strong signals with high predictive value. Use techniques like signal-to-noise ratio optimization.
3. **Optimize Sub-Universe Segmentation** : Test smaller, more targeted sub-universes  for more precise alpha generation.
4. **Leverage Visualization** : Use tools like Sharpe ratio heatmaps to assess performance across different segments and fine-tune strategies.
5. **Balance Quality and Quantity** : Focus on fewer, high-quality alphas rather than many low-performing ones. Diversify alphas to reduce risk while maintaining consistency.
6. **Apply Robust Evaluation** : Use risk-adjusted metrics and cross-validation to ensure alphas perform well across different market conditions.

The "EUR D1 Theme" will be active from March 1st to March 14th, 2025, offering multipliers for EUR Alphas: 1.5X for regular EUR D1 Alphas and 2X for ATOM EUR D1 Alphas. ATOM Alphas must use single dataset fields, with exceptions for certain grouping fields (country, exchange, market, sector, industry, subindustry). Operators like  `inst_pnl()`  and  `convert()`  use pv1 data, so they count as using the pv1 dataset. The new EUR TOP2500 universe, which includes twice as many instruments as the EUR TOP1200, offers opportunities to re-simulate and refine your strategies.

### 评论 #43 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 1年前)

The EUR D1 Theme provides a structured approach to developing and optimizing EUR-based Alpha models, ensuring they meet key performance criteria. With dedicated multipliers for regular and ATOM Alphas, the strategy emphasizes using high-quality datasets and advanced techniques like double neutralization to enhance predictive power. Successfully passing the Sub-universe test is crucial for ensuring robustness, while leveraging tools such as the ACE API and visualization methods allows for deeper insights into model behavior across different market conditions. One important consideration in EUR, GLB, and other regions is handling currency differences. While the simulation platform accounts for currency conversions, traders must be cautious when dealing with fundamental and price-volume data fields, as they may be denominated in different currencies. Normalizing data or using functions like  `group_rank(x, country)`  can help mitigate discrepancies. How do you approach dataset selection to maximize the effectiveness of EUR-based Alphas?

Hi  [AG20578](/hc/en-us/profiles/12243980162327-AG20578)

> Instead of using the proposed solution above, you can try checking your alpha's performance with different neutralization settings. Analyze how alpha performance changes with changes in other settings.

This was spot on and worked better than I would have imagined.

The discussion surrounding the new EUR D1 Theme emphasizes effective strategies for improving Alpha performance under the updated guidelines. One key suggestion is to use the ACE platform to identify initial signals and refine them through dataset exploration. A major concern is ensuring that Alphas can pass the EUR Sub-universe test without relying on excessive operations or datasets. To address this, it is recommended to adjust neutralization settings rather than forcing an Alpha through.

The new EUR D1 Theme applies Quality Factor multipliers of 1.5x for regular EUR D1 Alphas and 2x for ATOM EUR D1 Alphas. ATOM Alphas are limited to a single dataset, except for six permitted grouping fields. Re-simulating previous EUR Alphas on the expanded EUR TOP2500 universe may improve outcomes. Optimizing Sharpe ratios through techniques like double neutralization and using visualization tools to evaluate performance across capitalizations is also essential.

Have you explored how different grouping fields influence Alpha performance under these new guidelines?

This new EUR D1 Theme provides a great opportunity to optimize alpha strategies with increased multipliers. The 1.5X and 2X multipliers for regular and ATOM EUR D1 Alphas can significantly boost returns. Expanding to the EUR TOP2500 universe is also promising, offering a broader dataset for more robust alpha development.

The Sub-universe test requirement ensures that alphas remain effective across different liquidity segments. Using double neutralization techniques, such as country + liquidity, can help maintain performance. Additionally, increasing turnover on liquid stocks could improve overall Sharpe ratio.

Leveraging the ACE API for dataset extraction makes alpha generation more efficient. It will be interesting to see how these changes impact alpha performance during the two-week period.

To create powerful ATOM Alphas, focus on refining early signals and enhancing performance. Use a 1.5X multiplier for regular EUR D1 Alphas and a 2X multiplier for ATOM EUR D1 Alphas. ATOM Alphas should rely on a single dataset, with up to six allowed grouping fields, and be properly set with the correct region, universe, and neutralization.

Optimize the EUR sub-universe test by minimizing unnecessary operators and data fields while preserving signal quality. Use techniques like double neutralization to improve Sharpe ratios and consider re-simulating EUR Alphas with the expanded EUR TOP2500 universe for better results.

Leverage the ACE API to download EUR datasets and generate Alphas with the correct settings. For performance analysis, use visualization tools to assess Alpha Sharpe ratios across different capitalizations, focusing on risk-adjusted returns to guide optimization.

Thank you for this insightful update on the EUR D1. The detailed explanation of Single Dataset Alphas and the Sub-universe test provides a clear framework for optimizing performance within the EUR TOP2500 universe.
One potential area to explore further is the trade-off between turnover and transaction costs when increasing performance on liquid stocks. While boosting turnover can enhance Sharpe in liquid segments, excessive trading might erode gains due to higher slippage and fees. A more structured turnover optimization strategy—such as dynamic rebalancing frequency based on liquidity conditions—could help maintain a balance between alpha generation and cost efficiency.

Hi  [TD37298](/hc/en-us/profiles/26582306929687-TD37298) !

Nowadays we have ATOM theme for EUR.

ATOMs are single dataset alphas and have relaxed IS Ladder test. Please check  [Single Dataset Alphas](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/consultant-information/single-dataset-alphas)  page.

In terms of passing sub universe test, sometimes just group_rank(x, group) where group =

group_cartesian_product(country, industry), might help. Try it out.

Hi  [JH44290](/hc/en-us/profiles/28903565485847-JH44290) !

Single dataset alpha:

x = fnd23_intfvalld1_stnr/assets;

gr = (country);

signal = ts_zscore(group_backfill(x, gr, 63, std=3),21);

signal

Fields fnd23_intfvalld1_stnr and assets come from same dataset  [Fundamental Point in Time Data (fundamental23)](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/fundamental23?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=EUR&universe=TOP2500) , country - is a support field that comes from  [Price Volume Data for Equity(pv1)](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/pv1?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=EUR&universe=TOP2500)  dataset. Please check  [Single Dataset Alphas](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/consultant-information/single-dataset-alphas)  page.

This one is NOT a single dataset alpha:

x = fnd23_intfvalld1_stnr/close;

gr = (country);

signal = ts_zscore(group_backfill(x, gr, 63, std=3),21);

signal

Because fnd23_intfvalld1_stnr comes from dataset  [Fundamental Point in Time Data (fundamental23)](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/fundamental23?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=EUR&universe=TOP2500) , close is from  [Price Volume Data for Equity(pv1)](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/pv1?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=EUR&universe=TOP2500)  dataset and is not considered as support field, country - is a support field from  [Price Volume Data for Equity(pv1)](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/pv1?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=EUR&universe=TOP2500)  dataset, so we do not count it. So, this alpha uses 2 datasets.

Hope this is clear.
