Fellow Quants, does dealing with Low Sub-universe Sharpe in Regular and Super-Alpha have everything in common? That is, are the ways of improving the same in Regular Alpha applicable in Super-Alpha?
Waiting for your insights, I'll greatly appreciate. Thank you and let's stay ahead.

Dear  [JN59512](/hc/en-us/profiles/25527898428951-JN59512) ! To improve your regular alpha & super alpha Sub-universe sharpe, you should use more illiquid universe (smaller universe size). Such as: TOP3000 -> TOP1000. Hope it helps you

Great question! Many techniques overlap—like improving diversification, neutralization, and reducing overfitting—but Super Alpha also benefits from carefully selecting complementary Alphas so weaknesses in sub-universes balance out.

If you want to boost the Sharpe of your regular and super alpha sub-universes, consider working with a more illiquid universe by reducing its size—for example, moving from TOP3000 to TOP1000. Hope this helps!

To improve the  ***Sharpe ratio***  of your regular alpha and super alpha sub-universes, consider narrowing the universe to less liquid stocks (i.e., using a smaller universe size). For example, moving from TOP3000 to TOP 1000 can often yield better results. That way, you can have a better performing alpha with minimum fails in terms of threshold metrics requirements.

I support what AG14039 and 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44) have said because it also works for me.

I think there’s definitely overlap, but not a complete one. For Regular Alpha, improving Sharpe often comes down to the basics: reducing turnover, neutralizing properly, and controlling correlation. In Super-Alpha, those same principles still apply, but you also need to think more about  **diversification across datasets and time horizons** , since a single weak spot can drag down the whole composite.

In my experience, Regular Alpha fixes (like smoothing volatility or better neutralization) give a quick boost, but for Super-Alpha you need an extra layer—such as mixing in orthogonal signals, adjusting universe selection, or testing robustness with different decay rates. That way the Sharpe improvement is more sustainable across sub-universes

For Regular Alphas, low sub-universe Sharpe often points to weak signal strength or overfitting, so fixes focus on tuning decay, neutralization, and dataset choice. In Super-Alphas, Sharpe also depends on how diverse and complementary your pool is. Even if each Alpha is decent, combining too many correlated ones drags Sharpe down. So while the core tools (better transformations, stronger signals, robustness checks) apply to both, Super-Alphas also require active correlation management and balancing across regions, neutralizations, and decay horizons.

**Regular Alpha and Super-Alpha share many improvement techniques** , but the scope and emphasis differ. For  **Regular Alphas** , low sub-universe Sharpe often signals issues with  **signal strength, decay, or neutralization** . Fixes like refining transformations, tuning decay horizons, reducing unnecessary turnover, and testing across smaller universes (e.g., TOP3000 → TOP1000) can make a big difference. These improvements strengthen the signal itself and reduce noise.

Regular and Super-Alphas share improvement techniques, but with different focus. For Regular Alphas, low sub-universe Sharpe often points to weak signals, decay, or neutralization issues. Refining transformations, tuning decay, reducing turnover, and testing smaller universes (TOP3000 → TOP1000) can strengthen the signal and cut noise.

Are there any more methods to improve this metric without going to a lower universe?
