Hello everyone! 👋

Today, you are diving into how to use the  **term structure**  within common analyst datasets to uncover potential Alpha signals. When you examine datasets like  `analyst14`  and  `analyst15` , you'll notice they exhibit term structures across various fields. For instance, if you explore  `anl14_mean_eps` , you'll find multiple fields sharing the same prefix but differing in their time horizons, such as  `fp1` ,  `fp2` , …,  `fy1` ,  `fy2` , etc.

🔍  **Understanding the Time Horizons:**

- **`fp1`** : Represents the upcoming quarter.
- **`fy1`** : Represents the upcoming year.

These different suffixes indicate their respective time horizons, allowing you to derive estimated growth differences across many periods.

### 📊 Sample Template

One potential template you can use is:

> group_zscore(subtract(group_zscore(anl14_mean_eps_<period1>, industry), group_zscore(anl14_mean_eps_<period2>, industry)), industry)

This template captures the  **sector-normalized difference**  between the average estimates in  **Period one**  and  **Period two** . Building on the previous templates, you can extend this further:

> <group_compare_op_1>(<diff_op>(<group_compare_op_2>(anl14_mean_eps_<period1>, <group_2>), <group_compare_op_3>(anl14_mean_eps_<period2>, <group_3>)), <group_1>)

✨  **Key Points:**

- The prefix  `anl14_mean_eps_`  is kept to ensure that comparisons are made between comparable metrics, preventing your Alpha search from devolving into random comparisons.
- All operators and group data become abstract choices, each embodying the economic intuition behind the original selection. For example,  `<group_compare_op_1>`  might initially use  `group_zscore` , but other valid options could include  `group_rank` , which also compares the instrument to its peers within  `<group_1>` .

📂  **More Dataset Information:**  The dataset includes other valuable information such as the  **number of estimations** ,  **standard deviation across estimates** , and more.

💡  **Discussion Prompt:**  How will you systematically utilize this additional information within your templates? Share your thoughts and tips below!

Happy research! 🚀

I've been diving into the term structures within datasets like  `analyst14`  and  `analyst15`  and experimenting with templates that capture growth differences across time horizons (e.g.,  `fp1` ,  `fy1` , etc.). The insights have been fascinating, especially when using sector-normalized metrics and different comparison operators like  `group_zscore` .

However, I've noticed the datasets offer much more than just mean estimates, such as the  **number of estimations**  and the  **standard deviation across estimates** . I feel these additional features hold great potential for refining Alpha signals.

**My Question:**  How would you systematically incorporate these additional fields into your templates to maximize Alpha potential? For example:

- Could the  **standard deviation**  act as a measure of analyst consensus, providing insight into confidence levels across periods?
- Would you apply weighting schemes or consider these fields in normalization methods?

One way you can look at this is if there is a lot of difference within analyst estimation (high stddev in other words), you should take a more conservative view even if it has great growth rate. How it should be implemented is left to you : )

Great point! If there's a high standard deviation among analyst estimates, it signals uncertainty or lack of consensus. To account for this, we could adjust the Alpha generation process to incorporate a confidence-weighted approach. I will test this. THanks

This is an excellent breakdown of utilizing term structures within analyst datasets to derive meaningful Alpha signals! The sample template is particularly helpful in illustrating how to systematically compare and normalize metrics across periods and industries.

Leveraging suffix-based time horizons like  `fp1`  and  `fy1`  provides a robust framework for uncovering growth differentials, and the flexibility of group operations adds further depth to signal development.

To systematically incorporate additional dataset information, such as the number of estimations or standard deviations, one could explore templates that adjust for dispersion or reliability of the estimates. For example, combining z-scores with a weighting factor based on the number of estimations might enhance the signal’s robustness.

Excited to see what others come up with—great post! 🚀

Great insights! I like how you’re leveraging different time horizons in analyst estimates to generate Alpha signals. Using operators like  `group_zscore`  and  `group_rank`  helps capture sector-normalized differences effectively. It’s also interesting how incorporating metrics like estimation standard deviation can improve model robustness. Looking forward to seeing more ideas on this!

Thank you for sharing your thoughtful insights on leveraging different periods of estimation! Your explanation sheds light on a critical aspect of model robustness and adaptability. The nuanced perspective on balancing short-term responsiveness with long-term stability in estimation periods is particularly valuable. This approach ensures that signals remain relevant while mitigating noise and overfitting risks.

### 评论 #16 (作者: TL60820, 时间: 1 year ago)

Thank you for sharing this comprehensive framework!  The step-by-step breakdown of signal generation and filtering techniques has made it much easier for me to implement more efficient alpha strategies. The ability to incorporate diverse data sources, such as sentiment analysis or macroeconomic indicators, is a game-changer for improving predictive accuracy. Additionally, leveraging risk-neutralization methods has allowed me to better isolate genuine signals while minimizing exposure to market factors. This approach not only streamlines the alpha creation process but also enhances model robustness, providing a solid foundation for testing and optimization. I’m excited to see how these strategies evolve in practice!

This is a great breakdown of using term structure to generate Alpha signals! The idea of comparing different time periods, like  **fp1**  and  **fy1** , gives us a deeper understanding of how expected growth changes across horizons. I particularly like how you incorporate the  **industry normalization**  to ensure we're comparing apples to apples. One thing to consider might be adding the  **standard deviation**  of estimates to refine the signal even further, as this can help filter out less reliable data points. Looking forward to more insights!

Hi,

Thank you for sharing your idea on how to use term structures in analyst datasets! By understanding fields like  **anl14_mean_eps**  and their time horizons (e.g.,  **fp1**  for the next quarter,  **fy1**  for the next year), you can estimate growth differences across periods and uncover potential Alpha signals.

The sample templates we shared are just a starting point. They help you compare estimates across time while keeping metrics consistent. Don’t forget to experiment with different operators like  **group_zscore**  or  **group_rank**  to get even more insights. It will help alot.
