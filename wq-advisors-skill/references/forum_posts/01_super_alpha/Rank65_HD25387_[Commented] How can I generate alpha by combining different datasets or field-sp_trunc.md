## 帖子正文

I’m exploring ways to create alpha signals by integrating insights across different data domains (e.g., fundamentals, options, sentiment, macro, etc.).
Would really appreciate any tips, examples, or thought processes that helped you generate cross-domain or multi-modal alphas.
Thanks in advance for any valuable comments!

Try to use logic to combine and test the alpha results. If good, then improve it !!!

Great question! Here's a structured way I approach cross-domain or multi-modal Alpha generation on the WorldQuant BRAIN platform:

### 💡 Thought Process

**1. Start from an Intuition:** 
Think of a hypothesis that ties multiple data domains. For example:  *“Companies with improving fundamentals and increasing call option activity tend to outperform when sentiment is also positive.”*

**2. Select Complementary Data Domains:** 
Combine different alpha sources like:

- **Fundamentals:**  Earnings growth, return on equity, valuation ratios.
- **Options:**  Implied volatility, put/call open interest ratios.
- **Sentiment/News:**  News_session_range, analyst_rating_score.
- **Macro:**  Inflation, rate spreads (if data permits).

Generating  **cross-domain or multi-modal alphas**  is a powerful strategy because it captures diverse market inefficiencies. Here's a step-by-step  **framework**  and a few  **practical examples**  to help guide your alpha design.

## 1.  **Strategy Framework for Cross-Domain Alpha Design**

### Step 1:  **Form a Hypothesis**

Identify a market intuition involving two or more domains. Examples:

- “Stocks with rising earnings and cheap out-of-the-money call options tend to outperform.”
- “High short interest (sentiment) + strong earnings beats (fundamentals) → alpha.”

### Step 2:  **Select Complementary Signals**

Choose signals that are:

- **Uncorrelated**  or weakly correlated
- Capture  **different time horizons**  or investor types
- Belong to  **distinct domains**

### Step 3:  **Normalize, Rank & Combine**

Use operators like  `rank()` ,  `ts_rank()` ,  `normalize()`  to make signals comparable. Then:

`rank_gmean_amean_diff(signal1, signal2, ...)
`

or use simple arithmetic:

`multiply(rank(signal1), rank(signal2))
`

## 2.  **Example Ideas by Domain**

### **Fundamental + Sentiment**

Hypothesis: "Stocks with improving fundamentals and negative sentiment may be undervalued."

`multiply(rank(ts_delta(net_income, 252)), rank(-news_sentiment))
`

### **Options + Fundamentals**

Hypothesis: "Stocks with positive earnings surprise and rising call volume are primed for upside."

`multiply(rank(earnings_surprise), rank(call_volume/put_volume))
`

### **Technical + Macro**

Hypothesis: "Momentum stocks in countries with falling inflation outperform."

`multiply(rank(ts_returns(close, 20)), rank(-country_inflation_rate))
`

## 3.  **Practical Design Tips**

### Combine Stable + Noisy

Pair a slow-changing anchor (e.g., valuation) with a fast-reacting signal (e.g., sentiment).

### Use  `trade_when()`  to Filter

Use  `trade_when()`  to avoid trading during high-volatility or low-liquidity regimes.

### Group Operators for Robustness

Use  `group_neutralize()`  or  `group_backfill()`  to ensure robustness across sectors or regions.

To create strong alpha signals, combining datasets like fundamentals, sentiment, and options can reveal different market dimensions. For example, use ROE from fundamentals, social media sentiment for short-term trends, and implied volatility from options for risk insight. When these are normalized and blended with operators like  `ts_zscore`  or  `rank` , they improve stability and reduce correlation. This cross-domain approach helps generate more robust and unique alphas.

Great question — cross-domain alphas can be really powerful when done right. One approach that’s worked for me is starting with a  **strong signal from one domain (like fundamentals)** , then layering in a  **filter or modulator from another domain**  (e.g., sentiment or options). For example, combining a low valuation signal with positive short-term sentiment can help avoid value traps. Also, keep expressions modular — build each part separately, test them individually, and only combine when both components are reliable. Using  `*`  (multiplication) rather than  `+`  often helps capture interaction effects more cleanly.

Cross-domain alphas can be powerful when signals from different datasets complement each other—for example, combining analyst revisions (fundamental) with sentiment momentum or macro trends. Look for signals that align in direction but originate from different domains to reduce correlation and increase robustness. Also, test each layer independently before blending to avoid noise stacking.

**How I Think About Multi-Domain Alpha Generation on WorldQuant BRAIN:**

-  **Approach**

1. **Start with an idea**
   Think of a hypothesis that connects multiple data types. Example: “Companies with improving fundamentals and rising call option activity perform better when sentiment is also positive.”
2. **Use complementary data**
   Mix different domains for richer signals, such as:

- **Fundamentals** : Earnings growth, ROE, valuation.
- **Options** : Implied volatility, put/call ratios.
- **Sentiment/News** : News signals, analyst ratings.
- **Macro** : Inflation, interest rate spreads (if available).

Great initiative! Cross-domain alphas can capture diverse market behaviors and reduce redundancy. A helpful approach is to identify complementary signals—for example, combining fundamental undervaluation with bullish options sentiment or macro tailwinds. I’ve found it useful to align time horizons across domains and apply normalization before integration. Simple combos like  `rank(fundamental) + rank(sentiment)`  can often reveal strong effects. Keep experimenting—diversity is your strength here!
