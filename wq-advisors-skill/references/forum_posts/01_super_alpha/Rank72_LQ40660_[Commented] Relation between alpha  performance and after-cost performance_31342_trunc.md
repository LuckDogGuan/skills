Great question! The relationship between alpha performance and after-cost performance is crucial for evaluating the true profitability of an alpha.

Alpha performance measures the theoretical return of a strategy, without accounting for transaction costs. In contrast, after-cost performance reflects the actual return after deducting slippage, transaction fees, and execution costs.

An alpha with high theoretical return but high turnover or that operates in a low-liquidity universe may suffer from high trading costs, leading to low after-cost performance. On the other hand, alphas with low turnover or that operate in high-liquidity universes tend to have after-cost PnL curves that closely match the original PnL, maintaining better execution efficiency.

Therefore, when designing or selecting alphas—especially on the WorldQuant BRAIN platform—it's important to prioritize those with strong performance under Investability Constraints. This not only improves real-world viability but also increases the chance of inclusion in SuperAlphas.

In short: high alpha performance is necessary, but after-cost performance is what really matters in practice.

CAP is your overall score based on how well all your Alphas (data strategies) perform in real-world tests. It’s updated every 4–6 weeks after a quarter ends (e.g., Q1 results come in early April). Alphas submitted in the last month of a quarter (like March for Q1) won’t count for that quarter’s CAP (since it takes time to calculate) but still help:

Qualify you for Genius status,

Boost the current quarter’s Value Factor,

Add to the next quarter’s CAP.

Your Genius level depends on the higher score between:

Performance of all your Alphas,

Performance of Alphas selected by WorldQuant.

Think of CAP as your “report card” for the quarter—great for tracking progress and leveling up!

CAP is the Combined out-sample performance of all consultant Alphas submitted by the consultant, while after cost CAP is the combined out sample performance after deducting the transaction cost while taking the trades based on your alphas.

Higher the turnover, higher the transaction cost, so it is advised to keep your alphas turnover on lower side to optimize after cost combined alpha performance.

Understanding the difference between CAP and after-cost CAP, especially how transaction costs "erode" potential profits, is a key factor in building truly sustainable and long-term profitable alpha strategies.

Alpha performance, often measured by metrics like Sharpe ratios and returns, reflects how well your strategies perform in ideal conditions. However, after-cost performance accounts for the real-world implications of trading, including transaction costs, slippage, and market impact.

One thing I noticed is that even with solid alpha performance (high Sharpe, low drawdown), the after-cost CAP can still dip if the turnover isn’t optimized. I had a few alphas last quarter with strong raw metrics, but after applying cost models, their contribution to overall CAP dropped significantly. I’ve started testing lower-frequency signals and introducing turnover constraints during backtests to preserve more after-cost value. Has anyone else seen improvement from explicitly managing turnover during alpha development?

It will be more than better if we can get one example for Alpha, to better understand how to use CAP

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALPHAS PERFORMANCE AND AFTER COST PERFORMANCE

Tool/Concept
Why It Matters

 **Performance Attribution** 
Breaks down returns into alpha, beta, etc.

 **Risk-Adjusted Returns** 
Measures like Sharpe or Information Ratio

 **Regression Analysis (e.g. CAPM)** 
Isolates alpha after accounting for risk

 **Fee Impact Analysis** 
Shows how costs reduce alpha

Thanks for pointing out, even i have the same doubt. Currently, my CAP is 1.98, can anyone please give me anytip so that I can increase it over 2.

An alpha with high theoretical return but high turnover or that operates in a low-liquidity universe may suffer from high trading costs, leading to low after-cost performance.

One thing that’s helped me improve after-cost CAP is treating turnover as a design constraint, not just an outcome. Instead of optimizing first and checking turnover later, I integrate turnover thresholds directly into alpha generation—especially useful in lower-liquidity universes.

Hi  [LM22798](/hc/en-us/profiles/17659089649303-LM22798)

On my end , I express After-cost performance as below mathematically:

> After-cost return = Raw alpha return - (Turnover × Average cost per turnover unit)

Where turnover represents how much of the portfolio is traded in a given period (e.g., daily, monthly).

About 2-3 months ago, WQ added fees to CAP, and most consultants' performance dropped seriously after that. So now, to have good alpha performance, keeping turnover < 20% is extremely necessary.

High-turnover alphas hurt after-cost CAP despite strong raw performance. I’m testing lower-frequency signals and turnover constraints to improve after-cost value. Anyone else seeing better results this way?

I’d need to know which  **specific two factors**  you’re referring to—are they alpha factors, risk factors, or some other variables?

### 评论 #17 (作者: AY28568, 时间: 1年前)

Alpha performance is crucial as it shows the potential value a strategy can deliver under ideal conditions. But it's the after-cost performance that truly matters to investors—it reflects what actually ends up in their pockets. High alpha can be eroded quickly by trading costs, management fees, and slippage, especially in high-turnover strategies. It's important to assess whether the strategy can consistently deliver net positive returns after these real-world frictions. A solid Sharpe ratio is impressive, but if costs eat away at returns, the alpha isn’t fully realized. Always evaluate performance through both lenses: theoretical and practical.

The distinction between alpha performance and after-cost performance is fundamental in quant strategy evaluation. While alpha performance indicates the theoretical return of a strategy without considering transaction expenses, after-cost performance captures the real-world profitability by incorporating costs such as commissions, slippage, and market impact. This difference is especially pronounced in strategies with high turnover or those trading less liquid securities, where transaction costs can severely erode returns. Therefore, it is critical to optimize alphas for lower turnover or focus on universes with higher liquidity to improve after-cost metrics. Additionally, applying constraints such as turnover caps or using smoothing techniques like neutralization can help maintain a more stable after-cost performance, which ultimately determines a strategy’s viability in live trading environments.

Alpha performance shows potential returns before costs, but after-cost performance reveals actual profitability after fees and trading costs. High turnover usually means higher costs, which can reduce after-cost returns significantly. So, balancing strong alpha with low turnover and good liquidity is key to sustainable real-world profits.

### 评论 #20 (作者: SK90981, 时间: 1年前)

Keep alpha turnover low to reduce transaction costs and improve after-cost combined performance for better out-sample alpha efficiency.

Thanks so much to everyone in this thread for sharing such deep insights. As someone still refining my understanding of cost-adjusted alpha performance, this discussion has been incredibly helpful. It’s easy to get excited about backtest results and raw metrics, but seeing how many experienced consultants emphasize  **turnover control** ,  **liquidity awareness** , and  **realistic cost modeling**  is a strong reminder of what truly matters in live trading environments. I especially appreciated the formula shared by EM11875 and the practical suggestions around designing with turnover in mind, not just evaluating it later. Looking forward to testing some of these ideas in my next round of alpha development—grateful to be part of such a collaborative community.

Alpha performance, shown through metrics like Sharpe ratios and returns, indicates how a strategy does in optimal conditions.  **After-cost performance** , on the other hand, factors in real-world trading costs—like slippage, transaction fees, and market impact—giving a more accurate view of actual profitability.

### 评论 #23 (作者: AT42510, 时间: 1年前)

Raw alpha returns indicate strategy potential, but net performance after costs reflects true earning power. Favoring stable, liquid signals boosts execution quality and raises chances of portfolio inclusion.
