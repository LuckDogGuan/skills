#### **Introduction**

In the quest for a robust SuperAlpha, balancing  **mean reversion and momentum**  is crucial. While static weighting can work,  **adaptive weighting based on volatility**  allows the model to dynamically shift between signals, leading to improved results. This post explores how incorporating  **a dynamic weighting mechanism based on short-term volatility**  can enhance a SuperAlpha strategy.

### **📌 The Idea: Balancing Mean Reversion and Short-Term Momentum**

The strategy combines two well-known factors:
✅  **Mean Reversion:**  Stocks that deviate significantly from their recent trend tend to revert.
✅  **Short-Term Momentum:**  Stocks with strong recent momentum may continue moving in the same direction before reversing.

However, the key innovation is  **using short-term volatility to dynamically adjust the weight of these factors** , allowing the strategy to adapt to different market conditions.

### **🔢 SuperAlpha Implementation**

#### **🔹 Selection Expression (Filtering High-Quality Alphas)**

```
turnover < 0.15 && operator_count < 10

```

✅  **Filters out high-turnover Alphas**  to reduce transaction costs.
✅  **Limits complexity by selecting Alphas with fewer operators ( `operator_count < 10` )** , ensuring efficiency.

#### **🔹 Combo Expression (Dynamic Weighting of Momentum & Reversion)**

```
stats = generate_stats(alpha);

mean_reversion = -ts_delta(stats.returns, 30); 

short_momentum = ts_mean(stats.returns, 10); 

std = ts_std_dev(stats.returns,10);

dynamic_weight = 0.5 + 0.5 * ts_rank(std, 20);

final_score = (mean_reversion * dynamic_weight + short_momentum * (1 - dynamic_weight)); 

ts_rank(final_score, 120)

```

✅  **Calculates Mean Reversion**  over a  **30-day period**  using  `ts_delta(stats.returns, 30)` .
✅  **Captures Short-Term Momentum**  over  **10 days**  using  `ts_mean(stats.returns, 10)` .
✅  **Measures short-term volatility ( `std` )**  over  **10 days**  using  `ts_std_dev(stats.returns, 10)` .
✅  **Uses  `ts_rank(std, 20)`  to dynamically adjust weighting**  between mean reversion and momentum:

- When volatility is  **low** , momentum gets  **higher weight**  (trend-following is stronger).
- When volatility is  **high** , mean reversion gets  **higher weight**  (more likely price correction).
  ✅  **Ranks the final score over 120 days ( `ts_rank(final_score, 120)` )**  to enhance robustness.

### **📊 Why These Time-Series Parameters?**

📌  **Momentum (10 days):**

- Short enough to  **capture recent price trends**  without excessive noise.
- Avoids lag effects seen in longer momentum windows.

📌  **Mean Reversion (30 days):**

- A  **moderate lookback window**  that captures overbought/oversold conditions.
- Short enough to be responsive but long enough to avoid false signals.

📌  **Volatility (10 days):**

- Reflects  **recent market conditions** .
- Avoids overreacting to short-term spikes in volatility.

📌  **Volatility Ranking (20 days):**

- Ensures  **smoother adjustments**  to the weighting mechanism.
- Avoids excessive sensitivity to day-to-day fluctuations.

📌  **Final Score Ranking (120 days):**

- Helps  **smooth out noise**  in the final signal.
- Ensures the strongest signals dominate over time.

### **🔍 Why This Works?**

✅  **Adapts dynamically to market conditions**  by shifting between momentum and mean reversion based on volatility.
✅  **Controls risk**  by giving more weight to mean reversion when volatility is high.
✅  **Reduces transaction costs**  by filtering high-turnover Alphas.
✅  **Ensures stable signals**  with ranking mechanisms that reduce noise.

### 评论 #12 (作者: KK82709, 时间: 1年前)

Thanks for sharing a really interesting and practical approach to superalpha construction. The way you try to combine reversion and momentum factor in one combo expression is really inspiring. Have you try each individual factor on the same selection idea ? Maybe you'll discover that the momentum part is not very useful. And can you elaborate more on how you choose those time series argument in the expression (30 days reverseion, 10 days volatility, 20 days volatility ranking and 120 days final score ranking) ? Looking forward to your replies. We have very few superalpha idea in the community while superalpha have the same impact on base payment, so it is quite appreciated for any superalpha idea.

This dynamic SuperAlpha strategy impressively balances mean reversion and momentum by adjusting weights based on short-term volatility. Using ts_rank(std, 20) as the core of the dynamic adjustment is smart, allowing the model to favor momentum in calm markets and shift to mean reversion when volatility spikes—reflecting real market behavior. I appreciate the thoughtful filtering of high-turnover alphas, which helps reduce costs and improve stability.

What stands out is how the approach adapts across market conditions, making it more robust than static models. To strengthen the analysis, I’d love to see performance metrics like Sharpe ratio or IC. Have you observed how this dynamic weighting performs during extreme events or sideways markets?

### 评论 #24 (作者: KS69567, 时间: 1年前)

This method of using dynamic volatility-based weighting to improve SuperAlpha works quite well!  A more flexible approach that reacts to changing market circumstances is produced by modifying the ratio of mean reversion to short-term momentum dependent on volatility.  The strategy may sustain resilience in a variety of market settings and optimise risk-return profiles by dynamically adapting to market volatility.

Hello DV64461. Can you help me know more about this issue?
How would you approach adapting this dynamic weighting strategy in different market environments? What other factors would you incorporate for improved performance?

---

### 评论 #26 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 1年前)

This approach to SuperAlpha construction is quite interesting, especially the dynamic weighting mechanism based on short-term volatility. By allowing volatility-adaptive shifts between momentum and mean reversion, the strategy effectively captures regime changes in market behavior. One potential enhancement could be incorporating a volatility-adjusted holding period, where positions are held longer in low-volatility conditions and rebalanced more frequently during high-volatility periods. Also, have you considered testing asymmetrical weighting adjustments, where momentum weighting increases more aggressively in up-trending markets, but mean reversion takes precedence in down-trending conditions? This could further refine risk-adjusted returns. Looking forward to seeing the performance results!

### 评论 #27 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 1年前)

This is a fantastic application of dynamic volatility-based weighting in SuperAlpha construction! 📊🚀 The adaptive mechanism between momentum and mean reversion is particularly compelling, as it accounts for shifting market regimes.

A couple of ideas for enhancement:
1️⃣ Alternative Volatility Measures: Have you considered using ATR (Average True Range) or GARCH-based volatility estimates instead of simple standard deviation? These could provide more nuanced signals, especially in highly volatile markets.
2️⃣ Regime Classification: Rather than a continuous weighting adjustment, have you tested a regime-based classification (e.g., defining low, medium, and high volatility environments) and assigning discrete factor weights accordingly?

It would be interesting to see performance metrics, such as IC decay over different volatility regimes, to validate robustness. Looking forward to seeing results!
