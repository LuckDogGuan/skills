Great insight! Combining value and quality in a subindustry-neutral way is a solid approach—looking forward to testing this as well.

Great insight! ✅

Combining  **value**  with  **quality**  can often yield robust and persistent alpha, especially when  **subindustry-neutralization**  is applied. This helps isolate the  **stock-specific edge**  by removing sector/industry biases.

🔹  **Why it works well:**

- **Value**  captures mispricing based on relative fundamentals (e.g., low EV/EBITDA).
- **Quality**  identifies financially strong companies (e.g., high ROE, stable earnings).
- Together, they balance  **cheap but risky**  vs.  **expensive but stable**  — increasing Sharpe while reducing drawdowns.

🔹  **Key tips for this combo:**

- Normalize value and quality scores (zscore or rank) before combining.
- Use  `group_neutralize(..., subindustry)`  for cleaner signal attribution.
- Control turnover using  `ts_mean` ,  `ts_decay_exp_window` , or  `hump_decay` .

Really appreciate this insight! Combining value and quality while neutralizing at the subindustry level seems like a smart way to capture mispriced yet fundamentally strong stocks. Excited to test this approach in my own alphas

Blending value and quality factors in a subindustry-neutral framework is a well-established yet still highly effective alpha construction approach. Quality—capturing metrics such as high ROE, stable earnings growth, or low leverage—helps ensure the companies selected have durable business performance. Value—through relative measures like P/E, EV/EBITDA, or price-to-book—provides a mispricing component by highlighting stocks that are inexpensive relative to their peers. By applying the combination within subindustries, you effectively control for sector-specific valuation norms and business models, reducing bias from macro or structural differences. Implementation-wise, you could z-score or rank both factors within each subindustry, then combine additively or multiplicatively depending on whether you want balanced exposure or to emphasize cases where both are strong. A mild smoothing ( `ts_mean` ) can further reduce turnover while maintaining factor integrity. This approach tends to improve Sharpe by capturing persistent drivers of return while keeping exposures neutralized across industry groupings.

Thank you for sharing this concise but impactful insight on combining value and quality factors within subindustries. I appreciate how your observation gets straight to the point yet still reflects a deeper principle in alpha construction—balancing mispricing with business fundamentals while neutralizing sector biases. Your post is a good reminder that sometimes the most robust strategies are built on clear, well-tested foundations rather than overly complex signals. The subindustry-neutral framing is especially valuable, as it aligns with best practices for reducing unintended exposures. I’m grateful for the spark this gives to revisit my own factor blending methods and look forward to hearing how others in the community fine-tune this pairing for different universes.

Solid framework! Value + Quality within a subindustry-neutral context is a great way to balance mispricing capture with fundamental strength while controlling for structural sector biases. Normalizing and smoothing the signals makes it even more robust.

The idea of pairing strong fundamentals with relative valuation creates a more nuanced approach, allowing us to differentiate between companies that are fundamentally solid and also attractively priced compared to their closest peers. This makes a lot of sense for building more robust and sustainable alphas.
