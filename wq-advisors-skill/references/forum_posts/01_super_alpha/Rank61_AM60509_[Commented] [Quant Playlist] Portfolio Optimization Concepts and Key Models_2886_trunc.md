## **Portfolio Optimization: Concepts and Key Models**

Hello, today's topic is portfolio optimization. Below is the prepared agenda:

### **Agenda**

- What is Portfolio Optimization?
  - Definition of Portfolio Optimization
  - Objectives of Portfolio Optimization

- Key Theories and Models
  - Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization
  - Black-Litterman Model
  - Risk Parity

## **1. What is Portfolio Optimization?**

#### **Definition of Portfolio Optimization**

Portfolio optimization is a methodology used to allocate assets in a way that maximizes an investor's expected returns or minimizes risks. It considers asset returns, volatility, and correlations to effectively achieve investment objectives.

#### **Objectives of Portfolio Optimization**

- **Balance Between Risk and Return**
  - Maximize returns for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a target return.
- **Maximize Diversification Effects**
  - Utilize correlations among assets to enhance the benefits of diversification and reduce portfolio risk.
- **Tailored Asset Allocation for Investment Goals**
  - Design customized portfolios based on the investor's risk tolerance, investment horizon, and expected returns.

## **2.  Key Theories and Models**

#### **(1) Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization**

Developed by Harry Markowitz in 1952, this foundational model of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) optimizes the balance between returns and risks across assets to construct an efficient portfolio.

**Key Concepts** :

- **Expected Portfolio Return** :
  Weighted average of individual asset returns.

> Lp
> Uilli
> i1
> Hp: Expected return of the portfolio
> Ui: Weight of asseti
> Li: Expected return of asset


- **Portfolio Risk (Variance)** :
  Weighted combination of asset variances and covariances.

> 1
> jL
> 43: Portfolio variance (risk)
> Oij: Covariance between asset iand asset j


**Efficient Frontier:**

- Represents the portfolios offering maximum returns for a given risk level or minimum risk for a given return level.

**Constraints** :

- Total asset weights sum to 100%.

> Ui


- Individual asset weights must be non-negative.

#### **(2) Black-Litterman Model**

Developed by Fischer Black and Robert Litterman in the 1990s, this model combines market equilibrium and investor beliefs to provide more stable and realistic portfolio allocations.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Market Equilibrium** :
  Asset weights in the market portfolio are proportional to their market capitalization.
- **Investor Beliefs** :
  Incorporates subjective views on expected returns and risks for specific assets or sectors.

**Model Structure:**

- Combines market equilibrium returns (π) with investor beliefs to calculate adjusted expected returns.:


> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> E[#
> T 十T . PI . (Q-1 . (Q -卫.T))
> 卫[#: New expected returns
> Market equilibrium expected returns
> 卫: View matrix (reflects investor opinions on specific assets)
> 0
> Investor views (expected returns for assets based on Views)
> Q: Uncertainty in views (confidence in investor opinions)
> T: Market
> uncertainty adjustment factor


**Advantages:**

- Integrates market data with subjective views for realistic portfolios.
- Prevents extreme portfolio weights, ensuring stability.

#### **(3) Risk Parity**

Risk Parity is an asset allocation strategy designed to equalize the contribution of each asset to the overall portfolio risk. This approach lowers the weight of volatile assets while increasing the weight of less volatile assets to enhance stability.

**Key Concepts** :

- **Risk Contribution** :
  Measures each asset's contribution to the total portfolio risk.


> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> RCi
> Ui
> Owi
> RCi: Risk contribution Of asset i
> Ui: Weight of asset i
> Op: Portfolio standard deviation
> Q0e


- **Objective** :
  Equalize risk contributions across all assets.


> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> RCI
> RC2
> RCn


**Advantages** :

- Reduces the impact of highly volatile assets.
- Delivers stable performance even in volatile markets.

**Optimization Problem** :

- **Objective Function** : Adjust weights to ensure equal risk contributions.

Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) is one of the foundational models in portfolio theory. It aims to find the optimal portfolio that offers the highest return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of return. This model is based on the idea of diversification, which helps in reducing the overall risk of a portfolio.

- **Method** : LOF measures the density of data points and identifies outliers based on their density relative to their neighbors. It works by comparing the local density of a data point to the local densities of its neighbors.
- **Application** : Effective for detecting local outliers in datasets where the distribution may vary across different regions of the data. It is especially useful in situations where outliers are not global but localized.

The OS score evaluates whether the alpha can generate profitable signals in  **new, unseen data**  (Out-Sample period). If an alpha performs well on both the In-Sample and Out-Sample periods, it indicates that the alpha is not just exploiting historical patterns, but is also likely to perform robustly in the future.

**Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization**  focuses on balancing risk and return by identifying portfolios that lie on the efficient frontier. For example, an investor may consider a mix of stocks and bonds. Using this model, they can determine the allocation (e.g., 60% stocks and 40% bonds) that maximizes return for a given risk level. This approach assumes that risk is measured by variance or standard deviation and that investors are rational, seeking to optimize their trade-offs.

**Black-Litterman Model**  takes portfolio construction a step further by incorporating market equilibrium (the baseline assumption that markets reflect all known information) and the investor’s specific views. For instance, if the market suggests a 10% return for a tech index but the investor believes it will perform better due to recent innovation trends, this model adjusts the expected returns accordingly. The result is a portfolio that blends market data and personal insights, creating a more customized allocation.

**Risk Parity**  is particularly valuable for stability. It ensures that each asset class contributes equally to the portfolio's overall risk. For example, in a portfolio of equities, bonds, and commodities, equities typically have higher volatility. Risk parity would reduce the equity allocation and increase bonds or commodities to balance the risk contribution. This method is especially useful in volatile markets, as it promotes diversification and minimizes the impact of any single asset class on the portfolio.

These approaches illustrate the flexibility and depth of modern portfolio optimization techniques, allowing investors to tailor their strategies to specific goals and market conditions.

- **Description** : The missingness is related to some observed data but not the unobserved data. That is, the reason for the missing data can be explained by other variables in the dataset.
- **Example** : Survey responses related to income may be missing more frequently for younger respondents but not due to their income level—just because the likelihood of answering the income question depends on age.

Summary statistics also help in comparing different datasets or distributions. For example, comparing the means or standard deviations of two datasets allows for an understanding of how they differ in terms of centrality and spread. This is often crucial for tasks such as feature selection in machine learning or comparing model outputs.

If you’re looking for further ideas, here are a few extensions to experiment with:

- **Momentum indicators** : Combining moving averages, RSI, or MACD with price-volume data.
- **Volatility adjustments** : Incorporating ATR (Average True Range) to measure price volatility and adjust signals accordingly.
- **Volume-based signals** : Looking at volume spikes alongside price movements for more robust patterns.

Summary of the post:

Portfolio optimization is about smartly distributing investments to get the best returns while managing risk. For example, if you invest in both stocks and bonds, you want the right mix to balance growth and stability. The Markowitz Mean-Variance Model helps find this balance by choosing assets that maximize returns for a given risk level. The Black-Litterman Model improves this by combining market trends with personal investment views, making portfolios more stable. The Risk Parity approach spreads risk evenly across assets, so no single investment dominates. Choosing the right strategy depends on your risk tolerance and goals, helping you build a strong and diversified portfolio.
