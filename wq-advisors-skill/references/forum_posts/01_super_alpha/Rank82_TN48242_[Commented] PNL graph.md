Any of them could have a better os performance  pnl is not very important.. but thehigher the pnl the better

Hey CM45657

I agree with you

I think the first graph will have higher OS and better real-life performance, because simply graph 2 is 'too good to be true'. Sharpe alpha > 2 is already very good, so when sharpe > 3, the alpha is likely to have some unknowable bias problem.

Based on the 2 charts above OS can help me see the PNL path of the last year better this is my personal opinion

better focus on IS performance

Evaluating which alpha has better out-of-sample (OS) performance based solely on the PnL may not be entirely accurate. Additionally, the second chart appears too smooth, which could be a sign of overfitting. Therefore, I believe additional tests are necessary to assess the quality of the alpha before submitting it.

Compare the performance of alpha during a 1-year test period. Better performance in the test period indicates a higher probability of better out-of-sample performance

A P&L (Profit and Loss) graph is typically used to visually represent the financial performance of a company or individual over a period of time. It helps to track revenues, expenses, and ultimately profits or losses.

In my view, the first graph is more likely to generalize well and perform reliably out of sample. The second graph looks overly optimized — when a Sharpe ratio exceeds 3, it usually raises concerns about potential overfitting or hidden structural biases. Given that a Sharpe above 2 is already rare and impressive, any result significantly beyond that often warrants deeper scrutiny rather than immediate confidence.

When evaluating the potential out-of-sample (OS) performance of the two PNL graphs, it's crucial to consider not just the overall PNL but also the consistency and volatility of the returns. A graph that appears overly smooth, like the second one, may indicate overfitting, which can lead to unrealistic expectations in live trading. Instead, focusing on the robustness of the alpha during a test period, including its performance across various market conditions, will provide a clearer picture of its true potential. Additionally, analyzing metrics such as drawdowns and the stability of returns can further inform which alpha is likely to perform better in real-world scenarios.

### 评论 #11 (作者: GN51437, 时间: 1年前)

I think besides just looking at PnL or Sharpe, it’s important to check if the alpha performs consistently across different market regimes. Sometimes a smooth curve just means overfitting. I usually check subperiod ICs and sector stability too — that gives a better sense of real OS potential.

### 评论 #12 (作者: NQ13558, 时间: 1年前)

I have the same question too, sometimes, based on the PnL chart is difficult to identify whether the OS of the alpha is good or not. Are there any other data points that we can use to measure the OS performance of one alpha?

---

### 评论 #13 (作者: MG13458, 时间: 1年前)

the os is very unpedictable ,, any of the alpha could perform

---

### 评论 #14 (作者: ML65849, 时间: 1年前)

OS is not predictable as many consultants said, what we have to do is diversify our own alpha pool and expect each alpha to complement others. In this case we cannot say which exact alpha would have better OS. The second one looks very great, consider that it could be In-sample fitted result of datafield itself if it is included in model data category.

Thanks to  [ML65849](/hc/en-us/profiles/16237811130135-ML65849)  for the explanation.😊

OS performance can't be directly told from IS, OS performance is built on the robustness of the idea underlying the alpha expression, IS just give the performance of the underlying idea in the past period as complementary evidence for accessing the idea.

Between the two graphs, I believe the first graph (top) is more likely to have better Out-of-Sample (OS) performance. Although its PnL is lower than the second, it shows more natural variability, modest growth, and periods of sideways movement—all of which reflect more realistic trading conditions. In contrast, the second graph looks too smooth and steep, suggesting possible overfitting or excessive use of decay, smoothing, or lookahead bias.

Before submitting, I recommend checking the Visualization tab to run Rank Test, Sign Test, Sharpe stability, and performance across subuniverses. These help validate the alpha’s robustness under different conditions.

Lastly, I’d love to ask: What would you do if the PnL line in the OS region starts strong but suddenly flattens or drops after a peak? Should we revise the selection logic, reduce decay, or apply filters? Looking forward to hearing different perspectives on this issue.

In my opinion, the first graph seems more realistic for out-of-sample performance. The second graph looks too smooth, which often means overfitting. It’s better to focus on alpha stability across different market conditions rather than just PnL or Sharpe ratio.

### 评论 #19 (作者: CT69120, 时间: 1年前)

I think you should submit the alpha in the first image. In the second image, the PnL curve looks too smooth, which suggests that the alpha might have a high turnover. I’ve encountered similar situations before when experimenting with some datasets that resulted in high turnover. The alpha in the second image might be overfitting, so its out-of-sample and after-cost performance may not be good.

Judging an alpha’s out-of-sample (OS) performance based only on its PnL can be misleading. Also, the second chart looks overly smooth, which might indicate overfitting. That’s why I believe further validation is needed to properly evaluate the alpha’s quality before considering it for submission.

### 评论 #21 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 1年前)

This is a really important discussion, and I appreciate everyone’s insights. From a technical standpoint, I would favor the first PnL graph for potential out-of-sample (OS) robustness. While the second graph may seem attractive at first due to its smoothness and high Sharpe, this often flags potential overfitting. A highly smooth PnL can sometimes indicate that the alpha is fitting noise rather than true signal. To validate better OS performance, I usually perform  *rolling cross-validation* ,  *sub-period performance testing* , and  *IC/turnover stability*  checks. Also, adding realistic transaction cost modeling is essential—high PnL can quickly disappear in live trading if turnover is excessive. Robustness always wins long-term.

### 评论 #22 (作者: SK90981, 时间: 1年前)

Relying only on PnL for OS evaluation can be misleading; smooth curves may signal overfitting. Deeper validation is essential for true alpha quality.

When assessing the potential out-of-sample (OS) performance of two PnL graphs, it’s important to look beyond total returns and examine the consistency and volatility of the results. A graph that appears too smooth and steadily rising—like the second one—can be a warning sign of overfitting, which often leads to disappointing live trading outcomes. More realistic alphas tend to show natural fluctuations, modest growth, and occasional sideways trends, as seen in the first graph. Such behavior suggests robustness across different market regimes. Additionally, evaluating drawdowns, Sharpe stability, and performance in various subuniverses can provide deeper insights into an alpha’s true strength. Before submission, running tests like Rank Test and Sign Test on the Visualization tab helps confirm stability.

What would you do if your alpha’s OS PnL starts well but then flattens or declines sharply after a peak? Would you adjust your selection logic, reduce decay, or add filters?

When comparing PNL graphs for out-of-sample (OS) potential, don't just focus on total returns— **consistency and volatility matter more** . An overly smooth curve, like the second graph, may suggest  **overfitting** , raising concerns about real-world reliability. Instead, assess how the alpha performs across different market environments. Pay close attention to  **drawdowns, return stability** , and behavior under stress—these offer a more realistic view of which alpha is better suited for live trading.

Exactly—smooth, “too-perfect” PnL often signals overfitting, while natural fluctuations indicate a more robust alpha. In practice, I look for signals that:

- Maintain  **consistency across subperiods**  (via rolling cross-validation or subuniverse testing).
- Show  **stable IC and turnover**  over time.
- Remain resilient after accounting for  **transaction costs** , since high turnover can erode apparent gains.

When an OS PnL peaks and then flattens or drops, the approach depends on the cause:

- If it’s  **noise amplification or excessive sensitivity** , smoothing with ts_decay_linear, ts_mean, or adjusting decay parameters can help.
- If the alpha’s  **structural signal is weak** , adding liquidity/volatility filters or refining selection logic may restore stability.
- If these fixes don’t improve performance, it often points to a  **fundamental limitation in the alpha premise** , suggesting a new idea may be more effective.

Have you experimented with combining decay adjustments and subuniverse filters to stabilize post-peak PnL?
