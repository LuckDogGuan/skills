The  **Amihud Illiquidity Ratio**  is a financial metric developed by Yakov Amihud.

It is used to measure market illiquidity and its impact on asset prices. This ratio evaluates how much the price of a stock moves relative to the volume of trades. It is particularly useful for assessing the cost of trading in markets with low liquidity  [ **ILLIQUID_MINVOL1M**  Universe].

The Amihud Illiquidity Ratio can be expressed as:

Illiquidity Ratio= Absolute Returns/Dollar Volume

 **IMPLEMENTATION IN BRAIN**

Absolute_returns=abs(ts_delta(close,1)); #Daily absolute returns

Dollar_volume=multiply(volume,close); #Convert Raw volume to dollar volume

Daily_Illiquidity=divide(Absolute_returns,Dollar_volume);

Amihud_Ratio=ts_mean(Daily_illiquidity,20) ;#To smooth the illiquidity ratio over a period N (e.g., 20 days):

**Comment;**  This part is OPTIONAL!

To neutralize the effect of market, sector, or industry factors, use:

`group_neutralize(Amihud_ratio,industry)`

**INTUITION**

**High Illiquidity;** A high ratio indicates the the stock moves significantly with a small trading volume,reflecting poor liquidity.This can ressult in high transaction costs for traders.

**Low illiquidity;** A low ratio reflects minimal price changes relative to the dollar trading volume,implying better liquidity with low trading volumes.

### **Key Characteristics**

1. **Sensitivity to Trading Volume** : Stocks with low trading volume typically have higher Amihud illiquidity values.
2. **Risk Proxy** : It serves as a proxy for market risk, as illiquid stocks are harder to buy or sell without affecting their prices.
3. **Time-Varying** : The illiquidity ratio can change based on market conditions, such as increased volatility or macroeconomic shifts.

### **Applications**

1. **Risk Assessment** : It is used to understand the liquidity risk premium embedded in asset prices.
2. **Portfolio Management** : Helps portfolio managers identify and avoid illiquid assets that may incur high transaction costs or pose challenges during liquidation.
3. **Market Efficiency Studies** : Used in empirical research to study the relationship between liquidity and asset pricing anomalies.

### **Limitations**

1. **Assumption of Linear Relationship** : The ratio assumes a linear relationship between returns and trading volume, which may not hold in all cases.
2. **Outlier Sensitivity** : Extreme returns or volumes can distort the metric.
3. **Dependence on Observation Period** : Results can vary significantly with the length of the observation period.

### **Advantages**

- Straightforward calculation and interpretation.
- Relates directly to trading costs and market behavior.
- Useful for cross-sectional analysis of stocks.

**Note;** The Amihud Ratio can be calculated for different time frames (daily, monthly, or yearly) based on the analysis needs.

Hoping to get your feedback,Happy Learning!

- **High Illiquidity** : A high illiquidity ratio indicates that a stock moves significantly with low trading volume. This suggests that the stock is illiquid and may result in high transaction costs due to price slippage.
- **Low Illiquidity** : A low ratio reflects that price changes are minimal relative to the dollar trading volume, which suggests good liquidity and low transaction costs.

### 评论 #19 (作者: 顾问 PN39025 (Rank 87), 时间: 1年前)

Hi, in your opinion, should I choose High Liquidity or Low Liquidity because as far as I know, the volatility of high liquidity will be lower than low liquidity but the profit is the opposite. How to neutralize both liquidity, does that mean I will allocate alpha in many liquidity or not?

### 评论 #22 (作者: TN51777, 时间: 1年前)

thank you for your sharing, I have some suggestions:

- For shorter-term strategies, consider using shorter smoothing periods (e.g., 5-10 days).

- The industry neutralization is smart, consider adding factors like market cap or volatility for broader insights.
