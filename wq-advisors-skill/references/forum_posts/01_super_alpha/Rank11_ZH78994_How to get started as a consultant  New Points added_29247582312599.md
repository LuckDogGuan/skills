Here are a few tips that might me helpful if you are yet to submit an alpha or have just started to submit a few (A few new points that i have learnt in the phase between this post and the last one )-

(New points are related to turnover and after cost sharpe).

1) Get your basics strong , you can read about fundamental ratios and the inferences you can make from them and at least know the basic technical indicators to begin with . With more time going forward we can go into more complex stuff related to algo trading strategies or ml models(not required at the beginning ) .

2) Watch all the videos in the learn section plus read the documentation page a few times there is almost everything that you require to start out.

3) Use the alpha examples in the documentation and read the logic behind them now you can start out with improving the signal by using the hints provided in the examples. Once you are able to do this much and get a submittable signal out of the examples then we can move forward to finding similar ideas to those in examples but now by ourself.

4) Now assuming that you are able to at least come up with an idea now this one is my personal advice might not be correct but I find it hard to get started with the USA region because of high correlation so i would suggest to start out with GLB or ASI region ( I think US , ASI , GLB , EUR have the same weightage ) .

5) So in GLB or ASI region we can start with using the most basic operators zscore , ts_zscore , rank , ts_rank which was told to me during one of the session in consultant competitions this makes it easy to recognise which fields you can use for your alpha . Use MINVOL1M to start with you get better signals here compared to TOP3000 .

6) Neutralisations - now risk handled neutralizations might be better to use for your alphas and i think we were told to use them to reduce correlation as well but as of now i find the niche neutralizations to have lower prod correlation might be due to a lot of submissions in the risk handled ones plus the niche neutralizations take comparatively way less time to run (for me).

7) Before submitting any alphas make sure you have the test period on and at least have 2 years of testing data to affirm whether your alpha performs well or not there . You can refer to more tests here -  [Robustness Test_25238340364695.md](Robustness Test_25238340364695.md)

8) Make sure to not have turnover more than 30% from what i have learnt from a lot of consultants and my advisor it has a big role on your OS performance

9) You can check for after cost sharpe IS in the illiquid universe if that is available , it would be helpful going forward from now in genius program as well

10) Whenever you choose any data field to work with you can see what's the coverage for that data field . If you are working with low coverage data fields you can use ts_backfill or other related operators . More info here -  [https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/articles/19248385997719-Weight-Coverage-common-issues-and-advice](/hc/en-us/articles/19248385997719-Weight-Coverage-common-issues-and-advice)

11) When you add two datafields make sure to scale them down to similar limits .

12) Try to avoid overfitting the alphas to pass the tests or add noise to reduce correlation as it might affect your OS performance.

13) Ask any doubts you have in this forum or any other forum , your advisor and other consultants will be more than happy to help you with your doubts.

This might me sufficient enough to get started with your journey as a fellow consultant . I might add more points when i learn more in the months to come .

Happy learning !

For a best result a alpha, you may follow these point in short
1 have minimum field in a alpha
2 have two or three simple field in a alpha
3 have sharp and fitness maximum
4 turnover should be 10 to 15 
5 margin should be maximum
6 pnl graph should be show growth in last three year
7 Prod Correlation and self Correlation should be minimum 
8 return should be maximum and drawdown should be minimum

Focus on understanding fundamental ratios, such as P/E, P/B, ROE, and others. These are key for analyzing financial health and making informed inferences. Additionally, familiarize yourself with basic technical indicators (like moving averages, RSI, MACD) to lay a solid foundation. While advanced topics like algorithmic trading strategies and machine learning models can be explored later, building a strong understanding of these basics is crucial for getting started.

Thank you for sharing this very insightful article! Another aspect that could improve the post is focusing more on providing a detailed explanation of the impact of turnover and after-cost Sharpe on OS performance. Although these two factors have been mentioned, it would be more helpful if additional examples or brief analyses were included to explain why they are important and how to manage them effectively in practice.

### 评论 #14 (作者: KS69567, 时间: 1年前)

To get started as a consultant, focus on building strong basics by learning fundamental ratios, technical indicators, and studying the Brain documentation and videos. Begin by enhancing example alphas before creating your own, preferably in regions like GLB or ASI to reduce correlation. Use basic operators like  `zscore`  and  `ts_rank` , and leverage MINVOL1M for better signals. Prioritize robust testing with at least two years of data, maintain turnover below 30%, and scale data fields appropriately. Avoid overfitting, use niche neutralizations to reduce production correlation, and seek guidance from advisors and forums. Stay curious and improve steadily over time.

### 评论 #24 (作者: TL60820, 时间: 1年前)

At the beginning, you can start creating alpha signals using a model dataset. This type of data is often preprocessed, making it easier to work with and ensuring that it has good in-sample (IS) performance. Model datasets typically have cleaned, structured features, and can be used to quickly develop and test various alpha strategies without the complexities of working with raw or real-world data. By focusing on a well-prepared dataset initially, you can streamline the signal creation process, allowing for faster iteration and more efficient evaluation of different alpha models. This approach also helps build a solid foundation for later using more complex or real market data.

### 评论 #25 (作者: NT63388, 时间: 1年前)

For new Consultants, I typically guide them to start with datasets like PV and Fnd. From there, they can explore datasets where many Alphas have already been submitted. Understanding the meaning behind each operator is crucial for building a solid foundation of knowledge.

Next, try converting quantitative research papers into Alphas on the platform. Once you've succeeded, you'll likely be capable of generating Alphas independently. Finally, find your optimal approach—this will be a challenging journey, especially early on as your VF and Weight metrics might struggle.

Great tips! Starting with the basics, using simple operators, and working with regions like GLB or ASI to avoid high correlations seem like smart strategies. Focusing on turnover and after-cost Sharpe, along with testing alphas over a two-year period, will definitely help improve performance. Neutralizations, especially niche ones, can also be a valuable tool for reducing correlation. Keep up the great work and continue sharing these insights with the community!

This post provides a solid, actionable roadmap for newcomers looking to submit alphas, covering everything from basic knowledge to more advanced concepts like turnover and after-cost Sharpe ratio. The tips are practical and clear, especially the advice on starting with simpler regions and focusing on basic operators. It’s great that you also emphasize community engagement and testing, which are crucial for improvement.

One suggestion: It would be helpful to briefly explain key terms like " **neutralizations** " and " **MINVOL1M** " for clarity, especially for those who are new to the platform. Also, a bit more detail on why turnover is important and how it impacts performance could make that point even stronger. Overall, excellent advice—looking forward to seeing more insights in the future!
