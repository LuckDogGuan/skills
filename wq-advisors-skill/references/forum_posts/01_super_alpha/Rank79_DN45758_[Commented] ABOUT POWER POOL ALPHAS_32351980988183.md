For IS, prioritize sharpe, fitness, margin must be high.
Details:
USA: Sharpe > 2.0, fitness >=1., margin >= 16., turnover < 25.
"For PPAC: (Sharpe [2.5, Inf] -> submit), (Sharpe[1., 1.5] -> do not submit)"
The remaining regions: Shapre >= 1.8, fitness >= 1., margin >= 12., turnover <= 30. -> submit
However, still prioritize submitting alpha with high IS, diverse datasets, do not try to optimize alpha to the threshold of overfit.
Priority order: Sharpe -> Margin -> Return -> Fitness -> Turnover -> Drawdown

Honestly, this seems like the holy grail to me.

`Hi, try using these operators to control tuning, it will help you achieve good performance in power pool. Try tradewhen` ,  `hump` ,  `ts_target_tvr_delta_limit` ,  `ts_delta_limit` .

Honestly i keep tab on drawdown first, then margin and then all other indicators. Drawdown is very hard to decrease and as you know from portfolio theory that, risk can be decreased only when you have uncorrelated signals. This would also take care of sharpe somewhat i believe. And if you read between the lines, WQ have reduced self corr to 0.5 now, they are forcing us to have diverse signals through powerpool.

**Creating a Good Power Pool Alpha – Key Criteria**

To build a strong Power Pool (PP) alpha, you should aim for a balanced profile across multiple metrics. While Power Pool alphas can pass with slightly more relaxed thresholds, high-quality submissions still show consistent strength. Here are some general guidelines:

### 📈  **Sharpe Ratio**

- **Target:**  >1.5 (the higher, the better)
- Indicates risk-adjusted performance. A strong alpha typically shows stability across regions and time.

### 🧠  **Fitness**

- **Target:**  >2.5 (or as high as possible)
- Reflects how well the alpha performs across different sub-universes. Higher fitness = greater robustness.

### 🔄  **Turnover**

- **Target:**  <0.4 daily average
- Lower turnover helps with after-cost performance. Use operators like  `ts_delta_limit`  or  `tradewhen`  to manage this.

### 💵  **Return (Gross)**

- **Target:**  Consistent positive returns across regions
- Focus on signal quality, not just magnitude.

### 📉  **Drawdown**

- **Target:**  As low as possible (ideally <0.25)
- Lower drawdown means more stable performance. Watch out for volatility spikes.

### ⚖️  **Margin**

- **Target:**  >0.5 (preferably closer to 1)
- High margin suggests low correlation with other alphas – an important trait for good combo contribution.

I share the same concern as you. I didn’t participate in PPAC, so currently, I have no points or even negative points on the Powor Pool Leaderboard. I hope those who participated in PPAC and achieved high rankings can share their experiences.

Thanks for the detailed info, really helpful! Just to confirm — for USA region, we should aim for Sharpe > 2.0 and margin ≥ 16, right? I’ve been optimizing for Sharpe but will try focusing more on margin and fitness too. Has anyone tried using ts_delta_limit or hump to improve margin effectively?

### 评论 #9 (作者: 顾问 NA80407 (Rank 63), 时间: 1年前)

To be honest, I prioritize drawdown first, then margin, and only after that do I consider other metrics. Drawdown is particularly tough to reduce—and as portfolio theory suggests, real risk reduction only comes from using uncorrelated signals. That should also help improve Sharpe, to some extent. And if you read between the lines, WQ has now capped self-correlation at 0.5 in PowerPool, essentially pushing us to build more diverse signals.

Great question! Building a strong Power Pool Alpha requires balancing several key metrics to optimize after-cost performance while maintaining robustness. Typically, aiming for a Sharpe ratio above 1.0 in out-of-sample periods is a good starting point, though higher is always better. Fitness should reflect consistency and stability, so watch for steady returns without sharp drawdowns. Turnover ideally stays below 15-20%, since high turnover can erode after-cost gains. Regarding return and drawdown, focus on maximizing risk-adjusted returns, not just raw returns, while keeping drawdowns manageable (e.g., max drawdown below 10%). Margin requirements depend on the strategy’s liquidity and risk profile, but lean toward conservative sizing to avoid undue risk. Remember, these are guidelines, and practical tuning combined with the investability-constrained metric is key to crafting a competitive Power Pool Alpha.

Thank you for asking this important question—many consultants benefit from clear benchmarks when designing Power Pool Alphas. Your inquiry encourages a much-needed conversation about best practices and metric targets, which are critical for success in the competition. By sharing and comparing insights on Sharpe, turnover, drawdown, and margin levels, we help build a stronger collective knowledge base. It also reminds us that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer, but rather a careful balance guided by the data and real-world constraints. I appreciate you sparking this discussion, and I look forward to seeing the community share more tips and experiences to help all of us improve.

To build a good Power Pool alpha, aim for Sharpe > 2.0, Fitness > 3.0, low Turnover (<0.4), high Return, and minimal Drawdown. Keep Margin Usage low to improve stability. Focus on uniqueness, low correlation, and consistent performance across universes. Meeting these criteria increases your chances of selection and scoring.

### 评论 #13 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 1年前)

From what I’ve gathered and experienced, the key to creating a successful Power Pool alpha lies in achieving balance across several metrics—not just optimizing for one. Sharpe Ratio remains the primary metric, especially for the USA region (Sharpe > 2.0, Margin ≥ 16), but fitness and low correlation (margin) are equally important for long-term viability. Tools like  `ts_delta_limit` ,  `tradewhen` , and  `ts_target_tvr_delta_limit`  are essential for managing turnover and smoothness. Also, avoid overfitting by not tuning your alpha strictly to meet borderline thresholds—focus on general robustness and cross-universe consistency. Remember, alphas with strong margin and low self-correlation are preferred due to their combo contribution potential.

Thank you everyone for sharing these comprehensive insights! This thread has helped me better understand how to build Power Pool-ready alphas. I used to focus mainly on Sharpe and Fitness, but now I realize the importance of balancing those with Margin, Turnover, and Drawdown too. The advice on using operators like  `hump`  and  `ts_delta_limit`  is especially useful—I’ll definitely test those out in my next iterations. It’s also helpful to know that alphas with unique, low-correlation signals have a higher chance of scoring well in Power Pool. Really appreciate the knowledge being shared here—it makes the process far less overwhelming.

When focusing on Information Score (IS), prioritize Sharpe ratio, fitness, and margin. For the USA region, aim for Sharpe > 2.0, fitness ≥ 1.0, margin ≥ 16, and turnover below 25. For Power Pool Alpha Competition (PPAC), submit alphas with Sharpe above 2.5, but avoid those with Sharpe between 1.0 and 1.5. For other regions, a Sharpe ≥ 1.8, fitness ≥ 1.0, margin ≥ 12, and turnover ≤ 30 is a good baseline for submission.

The priority order to optimize is: Sharpe → Margin → Return → Fitness → Turnover → Drawdown. Personally, I monitor drawdown first since it’s the hardest to reduce, followed by margin and other metrics. According to portfolio theory, lowering risk requires uncorrelated signals — which aligns with WorldQuant’s recent self-correlation limit of 0.5 to encourage signal diversity in Power Pools.

To build strong Power Pool alphas, target Sharpe > 2.0, fitness > 3.0, low turnover (<0.4), high returns, and minimal drawdown, while emphasizing uniqueness and stability across universes.

What strategies do you find most effective for balancing drawdown control with high Sharpe and margin?

To create a strong Power Pool alpha, target a Sharpe ratio above 2.0, Fitness score over 3.0, and keep Turnover below 0.4. Aim for high returns with minimal drawdown, while maintaining low Margin Usage for better stability. Prioritize uniqueness, low correlation, and reliable performance across different universes—these factors greatly boost your chances of selection and a strong score.

### 评论 #17 (作者: AG14039, 时间: 1年前)

Yes, you're right—aiming for a Sharpe ratio above 2.0 and a margin usage of at least 16 is a solid target for the USA region in Power Pool submissions. While Sharpe reflects signal strength, margin ensures your alpha is scalable and less risky. Operators like  `ts_delta_limit`  and  `hump`  can definitely help improve margin by smoothing or constraining signal volatility, which leads to more stable portfolio construction. Many consultants have found success with these when tuning for better fitness and margin balance, so they’re worth experimenting with!

The high standards you mentioned are truly a big challenge when working on Power Pool Alpha.
I only have a small amount of Alpha meeting those standards at D0.

Do you have any suggestions on how to approach this?

**Key Criteria for a Strong Power Pool Alpha**

To create a high-quality Power Pool (PP) alpha, aim for balanced performance across these metrics:

- **Sharpe Ratio (>1.5):**  Indicates strong risk-adjusted returns and stability across regions.
- **Fitness (>2.5):**  Measures robustness across sub-universes; higher is better.
- **Turnover (<0.4):**  Lower turnover boosts after-cost performance. Use tools like  `ts_delta_limit`  or  `tradewhen` .
- **Gross Return (Positive & Consistent):**  Prioritize signal quality over sheer magnitude.
- **Drawdown (<0.25):**  Reflects stability; lower values signal smoother performance.
- **Margin (>0.5, ideally ~1):**  Shows low correlation with other alphas, aiding combo performance.

Focus on consistency, robustness, and diversification to enhance alpha strength.

When optimizing for Information Score (IS), your key focus should be on Sharpe ratio, fitness, and margin. In the USA universe, aim for a  **Sharpe above 2.0** ,  **fitness ≥ 1.0** ,  **margin ≥ 16** , and  **turnover below 25** . For the Power Pool Alpha Competition (PPAC), target  **Sharpe > 2.5** , but avoid alphas in the 1.0–1.5 Sharpe range. In other universes, a good benchmark is  **Sharpe ≥ 1.8** ,  **margin ≥ 12** ,  **fitness ≥ 1.0** , and  **turnover ≤ 30** .

In terms of optimization priority:  **Sharpe → Margin → Return → Fitness → Turnover → Drawdown** . Personally, I start with drawdown—since it's the toughest to manage—and then work on margin and Sharpe. According to portfolio theory, reducing risk means maximizing signal independence, which is why WorldQuant enforces a self-correlation cap of 0.5 in Power Pools.

To build strong Power Pool alphas, prioritize Sharpe > 2.0, fitness > 3.0, low turnover, stable returns, and low drawdown.

—What’s your approach for maintaining high Sharpe while keeping drawdown in check?

How many power pool alphas are you limited to submitting in a day? Because I am having trouble submitting more than 1 alpha. Any insights would be appreciated.
