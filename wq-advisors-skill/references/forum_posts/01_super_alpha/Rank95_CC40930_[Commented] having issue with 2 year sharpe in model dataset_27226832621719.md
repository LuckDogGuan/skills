I started creating alphas with model datasets but having issue of low 2 year shape. Even alpha having sharpe of 2.5 and more. How i can can improve my 2 year sharpe.?

Hi,

This is what I usually try in such a situation.

1. Use a shorter time series parameter: instead of 250 days, try 60 days, for example.

2. If using cross-sectional, group or time series z-scores, try the corresponding ranks.

3. Try different neutralisations.

4. Also, sometimes smoothing the signal helps. Try exponential or hump decays.

If none of the above work, move on to a different idea or a better implementation. Cheers!

Improving the 2-year Sharpe ratio of your alpha, especially when you're working with model datasets, requires addressing various factors that may be affecting the risk-return profile of your strategy over that time period.

Along with what  [NS94943](/hc/en-us/profiles/4557122515863-NS94943)  suggests I would recommend  trying out various trade_when conditions that you think may work with the particular datafield. You should also try implementing your alpha idea in different risk-based neutralizations like "Fast", "Slow", "Crowding", and "Slow and Fast"

- Experiment with varying time windows (e.g., 30, 60, 90 days) to see if shorter windows allow your alpha to adapt more quickly to local market conditions.
- Ensure that the shorter time period doesn’t lead to overfitting—sometimes very short time windows can make the model too sensitive to noise.

Improving the  **2-year Sharpe ratio**  for your alphas, even when they have a higher Sharpe ratio in shorter time frames, requires refining your strategy to ensure consistency and robustness over the longer horizon.

A low 2-year Sharpe ratio despite high alpha values might indicate that the model is not capturing risk-adjusted returns consistently over the long term.

It sounds like you're facing a common challenge with the two-year Sharpe ratio. One approach might be to analyze the volatility of your returns during that period closely. Adjusting your investment strategy to minimize drawdowns or incorporating different asset classes could also help enhance your Sharpe ratio. Have you considered backtesting with different parameters or diversifying your alpha sources?

To improve  **2-year Sharpe** , reduce overfitting by testing across regimes, adjust decay to balance signal longevity, and ensure proper  **neutralization** . Lower turnover to reduce noise, blend  **fundamental & technical signals**  for stability, and run  **rolling-window tests**  to check consistency.

When facing challenges in alpha development, I explore alternative approaches:

1. **Adjust feature selection**  – Instead of relying on traditional factors, experiment with unconventional signals like alternative datasets or event-driven indicators.
2. **Optimize signal weighting**  – Rather than equal weighting, use dynamic weighting techniques based on market conditions or regime shifts.
3. **Refine execution strategy**  – Consider liquidity constraints and slippage impact when designing an alpha, ensuring practical implementation.
4. **Incorporate non-linear transformations**  – Applying techniques like sigmoid scaling or piecewise functions can sometimes enhance signal robustness.

If none of these yield improvements, I pivot to a fresh perspective or rethink the core hypothesis. Flexibility is key!
