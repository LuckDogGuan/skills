**Super Alpha & My SAC Journey**

In the recent SAC competition, I was honored to place 4th globally. More than the result itself, what I truly valued was the process of learning and experimenting with Super Alpha. I’d like to share some of my experiences and hope to exchange ideas with others who are also exploring this space.

### What Super Alpha Means to Me

Super Alpha is essentially a combination of regular Alphas within the same region, where weights are assigned and a new Alpha is generated. What makes it exciting is that in many cases, the performance is stronger than that of the individual Alphas, and it often increases the weight factor as well.

### How I Approach Building a Good Super Alpha

From my experience, the most critical step is selection. My general process looks like this:

- Start broad: select around 200 Alphas without conditions, then review key indicators such as Sharpe, fitness, turnover, return, and margin.
- Narrow down gradually:
  - Begin with constraints like  `datafield_count`  and  `operator_count` .
  - Add filters such as long/short count or  `prod_corr > 0.02`  to remove overly extreme Alphas.
  - Take author-related metrics into account, for example, author fitness.
  - Use expressions to set priorities, such as  `if_else(favorite,1.2,1)`  or  `/turnover` .
- Once the pool is refined, check the raw performance as a whole. If it still looks solid, then proceed to combine.

### Combining Alphas

- For backtesting, I often use mode 1 first. It is the fastest and works well in regions like GLB where the selection count can be large.
- A practical and effective expression is:
  `combo_a(alpha, nlength = 252, mode = 'algo1')
  `
  It is simple, performs well, and is less prone to overfitting.
- For deeper evaluation, I turn to  `generate_stats(alpha)` , which provides detailed metrics such as drawdown and PnL. One important reminder here: avoid overfitting. Good in-sample performance does not guarantee strong out-of-sample results.

### Final Thoughts

These are just some of my personal takeaways on building Super Alphas. I’m sure others have developed their own strategies and approaches, and I would be very interested to learn from different perspectives.

For me, the best part of this journey has been the exploration itself. Sharing experiences, learning from one another, and continuously improving is what makes the process both rewarding and enjoyable.

This is an  **uber good** share! From my observation, when Selecting we should mainly go with simpler Alphas — e.g., Fields ≤ 2 and Operators ≤ 8 (can actually be even simpler than PPAs). Occasionally mixing in larger Alphas — like Fields ≥ 3 and Operators ≥ 9 — tends to yield better results. And I’d also recommend applying a certain level of decay after combo_a — it helps stabilize the signal and prevent excessive short-term noise. (jzc

[YZ51589](/hc/en-us/profiles/28971098588567-YZ51589)  May I ask, how do you view Self_Corr versus Prod_Corr? Do you usually consider both together? If you’d like, we could also connect and grow together via  **LinkedIn**  (jzc

Hi  [JC84638 ,](/hc/en-us/profiles/28348489344151-JC84638)

There was performance score during the competition. My focus was get the highest score so I can stay on top of the leader board. As long as my self_corr and prod_corr are below 0.7.

The performance score was a good indicator for os. however this doesn't mean prod_corr and self_corr are lower.

So for me during the competition performance score is what I am after.

However after the competition if you vf is high prod_corr would effect your base income.  If the sa is good on Sharp and Fitness , then the lower prod_corr the higher the payment would be. That's my observation please don't count me on it

Thanks for sharing your detailed process and insights! I agree that selection is the most critical part of building a Super Alpha. In my case, I also try to diversify across signal types (fundamental, sentiment, technical) before combining, since this reduces correlation and improves stability. Using  `combo_a`  with algo1 is indeed simple and effective, but I sometimes experiment with different nlength values to balance short-term vs. long-term signals. Great takeaways here!

Thanks for sharing such a detailed walkthrough of your Super Alpha process — it’s really helpful to see the full selection-filtering-combination pipeline laid out. I especially like the emphasis on starting broad, then narrowing down with metrics like Sharpe, fitness, turnover and correlation before combining. Diversifying across different signal types and keeping an eye on prod/self corr, as you mentioned, seems key to stability and OS performance. Great insights!

Appreciate you sharing your detailed process and insights! I agree that selection is the most crucial step in building a Super Alpha. Personally, I also focus on diversifying across different signal types (fundamental, sentiment, technical) before combining, as this helps lower correlation and enhance stability. While using combo_a with algo1 is a straightforward and effective approach, I sometimes experiment with varying nlength values to balance short-term and long-term signals. Lots of valuable takeaways here!

### 评论 #21 (作者: LB76673, 时间: 9个月前)

I appreciate how you emphasized the importance of careful Alpha selection, starting broad and gradually narrowing based on metrics like Sharpe, fitness, turnover, and correlation. Your process of combining Alphas with simple expressions like combo_a and using generate_stats to monitor drawdown and PnL is very practical. I also like the reminder about avoiding overfitting and focusing on out-of-sample performance.

### 评论 #22 (作者: PY38056, 时间: 9个月前)

Congratulations on the 4th place finish — that’s a fantastic achievement!your approach to  *Super Alpha* —careful selection, layering constraints, combining intelligently rather than blindly—is exactly the kind of disciplined creativity I admire. Thanks for the suggestions ...

### 评论 #23 (作者: NT34170, 时间: 9个月前)

This is an insightful walkthrough highlighted with clear rationale and solid practical experience. Your articulations on alpha selection strategies and modular refinement establish a strong framework that advocates a thoughtful and systematic mindset throughout the algorithm construction process.

### 评论 #24 (作者: HN45379, 时间: 9个月前)

This is a fantastic post. I really like how you emphasized selection as the most critical step, since building Super Alphas isn’t just about stacking signals but about choosing complementary ones with balanced metrics. Your use of filters like  *prod_corr > 0.02*  or turnover adjustments shows a disciplined approach to reducing redundancy. I also agree with your point that mode 1 works especially well for GLB—speed and scale matter in that region. Overall, your framework strikes a great balance between practical technique and caution against overfitting, which makes it very insightful.

### 评论 #26 (作者: TK30888, 时间: 8个月前)

It’s inspiring to see a clear and methodical approach applied consistently across both selection and validation stages. The emphasis on filtering Alphas, to refine performance and structure cohorts sensibly before aggregate creation, illustrates insightful practical understanding.

### 评论 #28 (作者: TV53244, 时间: 8个月前)

Your approach highlights a deep understanding of modeling processes and effective evaluation metrics throughout all stages. That steady balance between empirical experimentation and stringent monitoring of pitfalls like overfitting carries real value, particularly at scale.
