Hello everyone,

I have been experimenting with different alpha ideas on Worldquant BRAIN and trying to improve their overall performance. I've noticed that when I try to make my signals stronger, the turnover tends to increase, which then negatively affects fitness. On the other hand, when I reduce turnover, the alpha sometimes becomes too weak and loses predictive power. I would like to understand how experienced researchers manage this trade-off. Are there specific approaches or operator techniques that help balance signal strength while keeping turnover under control? Any insights or examples would be very helpful. Thankyou

Welcome to the most common, and arguably the most important, challenge in alpha design! The trade-off you are experiencing is the exact reason the "Fitness" metric exists. When a signal is too "fast," it reacts to daily market noise, causing stocks to constantly flip positions and destroying your score through implied transaction costs. The most reliable way to fix this is by applying smoothing operators like  `decay_linear`  or  `ts_decay_exp`  to your raw expression  *before*  you apply your final ranking. This preserves the core predictive trend while filtering out the daily static. Have you experimented with applying a 3-day or 5-day linear decay to your highest-Sharpe signals to see how the turnover reacts?

Great discussion, Lucy – and PD97561, your point about smoothing operators is spot on.

Another technique I've found helpful is applying  **truncation**  (e.g.,  `truncate` ) before ranking, especially when using z-score or winsorization. Extreme values often cause positions to flip violently from period to period. By capping them, turnover can drop noticeably without a big hit to signal strength.

Also, combining a  **slow trend**  (e.g., 10‑day decay) with a  **fast confirmation**  (e.g., 2‑day change) – then using  `ts_rank`  on the composite – sometimes keeps fitness high while reducing unnecessary churn.

Curious if others have tried using  `ts_sum`  over a short window as a lightweight smoother instead of full exponential decay.

Thanks for bringing up this trade‑off – it’s really at the heart of robust alpha design.
