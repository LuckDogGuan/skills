I am trying to create alphas in CHN region, but in most of the cases, the sharpe remains under 2.6 even after trying all simulation settings. Trends in US region doesn't seem to work in CHN region. 

Are there any resources for CHN region, that can help as a starter? Maybe something like things to keep in mind.

Hello, thanks for your questions. For the threshold of 2.6 as you mentioned, I assume you are referring to a D0 alpha in CHN region since the D1 requirement is 2.0. Thus, I would suggest you kindly try out some D1 idea first.

Besides, trying simulation settings is not a very sufficient way to improve an Alpha; I would suggest you try to apply  [these 21 Alpha examples](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/create-alphas/19-alpha-examples)  in CHN region and you can apply some changes or modification by referring to the hint. One thing to note is that the dataset name can be different between USA and CHN region, so you may want to double check the dataset.

Last but not least, you can refer to our learn section for more resource like the article:  [Getting started on the China Research Region for Users](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/advanced-topics/china-region) , to know more about CHN region.

Since illiquid stocks such as small capital ones are difficult to short in the real-world CHN market, you can think about how to make profit on the long positions rather than short. Fundamental and analyst datasets can be good choice for selecting good stocks to long.

All my china alphas even with sharpe above 3 are failing the robust returns test and robust sub universe test... please share more examples of China alphas other than the two examples already available on this site.

Again, high Sharpe does not necessarily mean that your Alpha will pass the test. There are multiple reasons for not passing the test. For example, if your Sharpe/return is mainly from shorting stocks, then you will be more likely not be able to pass the test due to the short selling restriction in CHN market.

Thank you for your insightful advice. I would like to kindly ask if there are any specific datasets that are known to perform well in the  **China region** , particularly in zero delay.

Your guidance on this matter would be highly appreciated.

**In the China region, fundamental and analyst datasets are often good choices. For zero - delay, you might want to look at datasets related to real - time news or order - flow data. But always remember to check their quality and relevance to your alpha strategy. Also, keep in mind the short - selling restrictions which can impact how you use the data.**

Creating alphas in the CHN (China) region can indeed be challenging due to different market dynamics, volatility patterns, and data characteristics compared to more mature markets like the US. Here are some considerations and resources that could help you refine your approach:

### Key Considerations for CHN Region Alphas:

1. **Market Behavior** : The Chinese market has different driving forces, such as government policy, domestic sentiment, and regulatory influences. These factors may not be as pronounced in Western markets, and thus, trends and factors that work in the US may not apply directly in China.
2. **Volatility and Liquidity** : The Chinese market can be more volatile with occasional liquidity issues. These factors can affect the reliability of certain alpha models, so it's important to factor in risk management techniques specific to the region.
3. **Sentiment and News Impact** : The influence of government statements, policy changes, and news related to economic data or geopolitical events is often more pronounced in China. Incorporating sentiment data, particularly related to these factors, can help improve model accuracy.
4. **Data Availability and Quality** : Access to high-quality, region-specific data is crucial. While global datasets can be useful, regional and local datasets (e.g., China-specific news, financial reports, and market sentiment) are essential for better predictions.
5. **Behavioral Factors** : Retail investor behavior can be more prominent in China, and certain technical indicators or strategies based on retail sentiment might perform better in this market compared to institutional-driven markets like the US.

### Resources for CHN Region Alphas:

- **China-Specific Sentiment Data** : Datasets like "China Social Media Sentiment Data" (e.g., sentiment32) and "China Fundamentals and Technicals Models" provide insights into market sentiment and fundamentals specific to Chinese companies.
- **Analyst Revisions** : Look into datasets like "Analyst Revisions Model Data" (e.g., model216) to track changes in analyst ratings or target prices specific to Chinese stocks.
- **Macroeconomic Data** : China's macroeconomic indicators, including GDP growth, industrial output, and other government-driven reports, should be incorporated to capture broader economic trends.
- **Government Policies** : Stay updated on regulatory changes and government policies, as they can have a direct and significant impact on stock movements. Tools that track Chinese regulatory news or updates, such as "Ravenpack News Data" (e.g., news18), can be particularly useful.
- **Regional Risk Factors** : Consider datasets that account for risk factors unique to the region (e.g., "Factors Dislocations Data" during periods like the COVID-19 pandemic). These could be used to adjust strategies for periods of market stress or uncertainty.

### Things to Keep in Mind:

- **Short-Term Focus** : Short-term price movements may be more predictable in China, particularly for retail-driven stocks. Therefore, strategies that focus on short-term momentum could be more effective than long-term trend-following strategies.
- **Sector Rotation** : The Chinese market experiences distinct sector rotations, often driven by government policy shifts (e.g., focus on tech, green energy, or infrastructure). Using sector-specific factors and rotating between them based on market conditions could enhance alpha generation.
- **Technological Trends** : As China leads in areas like e-commerce, fintech, and technology, incorporating these trends into your alpha models can be a source of significant insights.
- **Risk Management** : Due to the higher volatility, ensure that your models have robust risk management strategies in place, especially to handle large drawdowns or high levels of uncertainty.

By adjusting your focus to these specific factors and using regionally tailored datasets, you may increase your chances of achieving higher Sharpe ratios and generating successful alpha in the CHN region.

China's stock market is significantly influenced by government policies, domestic sentiment, and regulatory changes. Unlike Western markets, these factors can drive market movements more profoundly. For instance, active government intervention is a notable feature of the Chinese stock market, which can impact market dynamics and investor behavior.

While trends and factors in the US region may not perform as well in China, tailoring your alpha strategies to the local market conditions is crucial. Focus on understanding the unique market dynamics in China, particularly the influence of government policy, retail investors, and sector-specific risks. Experiment with sentiment analysis, alternative data, and local factor models, and always be prepared to adjust strategies as you gather more insights into the CHN market.
