A common challenge in alpha design is  **turnover** . Too much trading eats into performance through transaction costs and slippage. The  `hump`  operator offers a simple way to keep it in check.

`hump(x, hump = 0.01)`  smooths out small fluctuations in a signal so that trading only happens when there is a  **meaningful move** . Minor daily noise does not trigger trades, which keeps turnover low and helps improve  **after cost performance** .

Think of it as a  **filter** :

- If today’s change is smaller than the hump threshold → stick with yesterday’s value.
- If the change is larger → adjust gradually, limiting how much the signal can move.

**Example (Price-based signal):**

`hump(-ts_delta(close, 5), hump = 0.00001)  
`

Avoids unnecessary trades caused by tiny 5-day price shifts.

**Example (Fundamentals):**

`hump(eps/close, hump = 0.001)  
`

Stabilizes earnings yield so small EPS updates do not lead to excess trading.

**Quick Comparison:**

- Without hump: Signal jumps daily → high turnover → higher costs.
- With hump: Signal adjusts smoothly → controlled turnover → better after cost performance.

In short,  `hump`  helps make alphas  **less noisy, more stable, and cost efficient** .

The  **hump operator**  reduces turnover by filtering out small signal changes, preventing unnecessary trades. It smooths signals, making them more stable, cost-efficient, and effective after transaction costs.

Very insightful! I’ve found the hump operator especially useful when working with volatile signals prone to overtrading. It strikes a nice balance between responsiveness and cost control. Have you tested adaptive hump values based on recent volatility?

Great explanation! I’ve also found that  `hump()`  works well not only for reducing turnover, but also for stabilizing signals before applying further transformations like  `zscore()`  or  `neutralize()` . By filtering out micro-noise first, the downstream operations become cleaner and less sensitive to daily fluctuations.

In some of my experiments, a small hump threshold combined with decay functions (e.g.,  `decay_linear` ) produced smoother signals with both lower turnover and better Sharpe ratios. Curious if others have tried combining hump with decay or purify functions?

I really like how you framed  *hump*  as a simple filter for reducing unnecessary trades — the practical examples (price-based vs. fundamentals) make it very clear. It’s an underrated operator, and this breakdown shows exactly why it matters for after-cost performance.

One suggestion that might add even more value: maybe include a quick backtest snapshot (with vs. without hump) to show the impact on turnover or cost-adjusted returns. A visual comparison could make the benefit stand out even more.

This is an excellent breakdown of hump() because it addresses one of the most overlooked aspects of alpha design—controlling turnover before it eats away at after-cost performance. By filtering out micro fluctuations, hump essentially builds a tolerance band that prevents overreaction to noise, which is especially important for high-frequency signals or those based on volatile datasets. I’ve found that hump works particularly well when paired with decay functions like  `ts_decay_linear`  or  `ts_decay_exp` , since it first removes the tiniest shifts and then applies a smoother weighting to meaningful moves. Another interesting application is combining hump with  `purify()`  or mild winsorization, so outliers and micro-noise are both controlled simultaneously. Choosing the hump threshold is critical: too tight, and you overtrade; too wide, and you risk missing meaningful moves. One adaptive approach is scaling the hump value by recent volatility (e.g., ATR or rolling std_dev), which makes the threshold dynamic across regimes. Overall, hump is a deceptively simple but very powerful operator for improving alpha stability and cost efficiency.

The hump operator has been really effective for me when dealing with noisy, overactive signals. It seems to balance reactivity and trading costs nicely. Have you tried adjusting the hump dynamically based on short-term volatility

I appreciate you giving this knowledge. It's really helpful to hear how the hump operator reduces turnover and filters out minor fluctuations.

Hump works well to smooth noisy signals while limiting excessive trading. Dynamically adjusting it to short-term volatility can improve responsiveness during high-volatility periods and reduce overtrading in calmer markets, enhancing both stability and efficiency.
