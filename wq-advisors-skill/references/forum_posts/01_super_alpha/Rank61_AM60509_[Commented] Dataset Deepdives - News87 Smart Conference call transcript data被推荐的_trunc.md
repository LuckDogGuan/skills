## 帖子正文

Conference calls, also known as analyst/earnings calls, are significant events for public companies and investors to discuss in detail the firm’s fiscal quarter, as well as projected financial performance and future business insights. Thus, these events may contain impactful information related to the firm’s stock price such as new information, sentiment, surprise, reaction, etc.

This article will discuss potentially unique Alphas using "News87" dataset named “Smart Conference Call Transcript Data” for Global region.

**Dataset Highlight**

- The "News87" dataset is classified under the Analyst category > Analyst Estimate subcategory.
- Data Type: VECTOR type only
- Regions: USA D-1 & D-0. GLB D-1
- At the time of writing, "News87" is quite under-explored by the consultant community in GLB region compared to Analyst category in general (table below). This makes "News87" potential source for creating low-correlation Alphas. Info on GLB Alphas in the dataset at the time of publishing:

- The ideas discussed below can be used to create Alphas in both USA and GLB Regions. It is encouraged for consultants to submit Alphas especially in GLB Region for this dataset.

**Dataset Feature**

1. **Low frequency, low coverage.**  Conference calls aren't mandatory, but most public companies hold them, usually within one month after the completion of the quarter, following the quarterly earnings announcement. Thus, a quarterly frequency is typically observed, and at least a 63-day backfill is recommended.
2. **Participants and Sections concepts.** Given the conference calls' nature in business presentations & discussions, there are various objects regarding the call participants and presentation sections that are seen across the "News87" dataset.
3. **Structured into three statistical groups: Basic Stats, Readability Score, and Sentiment Score.**  These metrics are extracted from calls that are recorded and broadcasted live on the internet. Vendors transcribe the calls into written text for investors to consume, and advanced measurement such as NLP algorithm are applied to derive various statistics.

1. Basic Stats:General basic count and its derived values of information including:

*Ex: "mws87_numvswordsratioceoqa" is the Number of numerical words divided by number of all words spoken by CEO in Q&A*

1. Readability Score:There are many numeric test indices, calculated from the number of characters, words, sentences, etc... from textual transcript, indicating linguistic complexity across Participants and Sections. The values of these data ranging from 0 to 100 and specific test indices provided by "News87 dataset are listed below:

*Ex: "mws87_oper_fre_qa" is The Flesch Reading Ease score of the operator in Q&A*

1. Sentiment Score:for various Participants under different Sections.

*Ex: "mws87_corppart_sent_score_qa: is The sentiment score of corporate participants in Q&A*

**Usage Advice**

1. Check coverage, as different fields within the dataset may vary given their economic implications. For example, analysts may seldom talk, or the CEO not attending the meeting may lead to lower coverage for certain fields.
2. It is always advisable to use ts_backfill() operator for all datafields in this dataset. Backfilling at least one or two quarters and removing outliers by winsorize, truncating, etc.., especially for sentiment data, are recommended.
3. Time series operators may be useful given the different base value of sentiment of different markets, companies and individuals.
4. Earnings conference data can serve as a long-term signal, similar to fundamental data as its contain sentiment, reaction, etc.. factors derived from latest business and financial discussion information.
5. Try applying this to different universes in the GLB region to achieve low correlation and maximize value scores.

- **Sample Alpha Ideas**

1. Tone and Sentiment: Conference call linguistic tone of the dialogue between management and analysts may predict abnormal returns. The below can be starting points:

See Papers:  [Earnings conference calls and stock returns: The incremental informativeness of textual tone](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1625863)

1. Financial reporting readability: Consistent and low financial report readability impeding the efficient and accurate assimilation of information into stock prices, less understandable reporting are associated with greater equity mispricing and momentum effect.

See Papers:  [Annual report readability and equity mispricing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1815566923000188)

**Alpha Performance and Correlation** Below is the performance of a Single Dataset Alpha idea implemented on this dataset in the GLB Region. 
High Margin with Low production correlation is easily achievable if one creates Alphas using this dataset.

Thank you for the detailed and insightful post on the 'News87' dataset! The breakdown of dataset features, usage advice, and Alpha ideas is incredibly helpful, especially for exploring low-correlation opportunities in the GLB region.

One Alpha idea that comes to mind is leveraging changes in the sentiment scores of management participants during Q&A sessions across consecutive quarters. A sudden positive shift, especially after a series of negative tones, could signal improved outlooks that aren't yet priced in.

Additionally, experimenting with the interaction between readability scores (e.g., FKGL) and sentiment scores might reveal patterns related to clarity and optimism, particularly in highly regulated sectors.

Looking forward to diving into this dataset further and contributing some unique ideas!

### 评论 #51 (作者: 顾问 ZH78994 (Rank 11), 时间: 1年前)

Conference calls, also known as earnings or analyst calls, are pivotal events where companies discuss their financial performance and future projections. These calls provide valuable insights that can influence a company’s stock price, including new information, sentiment, and surprises in performance. Investors keen on uncovering Alpha—excess returns beyond the market—can use conference call transcripts to identify these market-moving factors.

The **“News87” dataset**, titled "Smart Conference Call Transcript Data," offers a rich source of information from global companies. By analyzing these transcripts, investors can apply **sentiment analysis** and **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques to detect shifts in tone, sentiment, and key themes that may precede stock price movements. For instance, positive sentiment in the tone of the call, unexpected earnings surprises, or strong forward guidance can signal potential investment opportunities.

Machine learning models can be trained to correlate specific linguistic patterns or sentiment changes with stock price reactions. Investors can leverage these insights to create **event-driven strategies**, predicting stock price movements based on the content of earnings calls.

While promising, this approach requires careful risk management to avoid pitfalls like **overfitting** and **market volatility**. By combining these methods, the "Smart Conference Call Transcript Data" can help uncover unique Alpha signals and provide a competitive edge in quantitative investing.

This article provides valuable insights into leveraging the "News87" dataset, specifically for generating low-correlation Alphas based on conference call transcript data. Here are some key takeaways and potential Alpha ideas:

### Key Features of "News87" Dataset:

1. **Data Types** : VECTOR type, with specific regions and limited coverage, making it an under-explored yet promising dataset for Alpha generation.
2. **Low Frequency** : Typically quarterly data, but with varying participant involvement (e.g., CEO, CFO, operators, sell-side analysts), making it essential to backfill data using operators like  `ts_backfill()` .
3. **Statistical Groups** : Basic Stats, Readability Score, and Sentiment Score, which can be used to gauge linguistic complexity, sentiment trends, and participation patterns during conference calls.

### Alpha Ideas Derived from Conference Calls:

1. **Tone and Sentiment** :
   - **Change in Sentiment** : Track the change in the tone (positive vs. negative) in the Q&A section and how it relates to stock performance. For example:
   scss
   複製程式碼
   `subtract(ts_zscore(mws87_numvswordsratioceoqa), ts_zscore(mws87_oper_fre_qa))
   `
   This could capture discrepancies between CEO sentiment vs. operator readability scores in Q&A, predicting future price moves.
   - **Sentiment vs. Forward Sentiment** : Measure how sentiment in the conference call compares with forward sentiment scores. A high discrepancy could signal a mispricing opportunity.
   scss
   複製程式碼
   `subtract(ts_mean(mws87_corppart_sent_score_qa, 63), ts_mean(mws87_forward_sentiment, 63))
   `
2. **Financial Reporting Readability** :
   - **Readability vs. Mispricing** : Use indices like CLI (Coleman-Liau Index) to gauge the complexity of the CEO's financial reporting and its impact on stock mispricing. Low readability often correlates with greater stock mispricing.
   scss
   複製程式碼
   `ts_zscore(mws87_ceo_cli_presentation)
   `
   This might highlight stocks with potential mispricing based on the readability of their quarterly presentations.
3. **Earnings Surprises and Reaction** :
   - **Positive/Negative Surprise** : Measure earnings surprise based on sentiment metrics and how the market reacts to the tone and readability of the call. A quick market reaction post-call could provide insights into potential stock moves.
   scss
   複製程式碼
   `ts_corr(mws87_sentiment_score, stock_return)
   `

### Practical Considerations:

- **Backfilling and Winsorizing** : Given the quarterly nature of conference calls, ensure data continuity by backfilling, especially for sentiment data, and use winsorization or truncation to deal with outliers.
- **Exploring Universes** : Apply the Alpha ideas across different stock universes in the GLB region to capture diverse market behaviors and maximize low-correlation Alpha opportunities.

### Actionable Steps:

- **Explore the Dataset** : Begin with basic sentiment analysis and readability scores for key participants (CEO, CFO) and sections (presentation, Q&A).
- **Experiment with Sentiment Shifts** : Focus on changes in sentiment over time and how these correlate with stock returns or earnings surprises.
- **Test Cross-Component Alphas** : Combine sentiment, tone, and readability measures to construct multi-faceted Alphas.

This dataset offers rich opportunities to create unique, low-correlation Alpha signals, especially in under-explored regions like GLB. Happy experimenting!

Thank you for sharing this comprehensive and insightful post on leveraging the "News87" dataset for Alpha generation! The detailed breakdown of the dataset's features, including Basic Stats, Readability Scores, and Sentiment Scores, provides an excellent framework for creating innovative and low-correlation Alphas.

One question I have is about the interplay between sentiment scores and readability indices. For example, could a high sentiment score coupled with low readability (e.g., low Flesch Reading Ease or high Gunning Fog Index) indicate potential misinterpretation of positive management sentiment by investors? Additionally, when using time series operators like  `ts_backfill()` , how do you ensure robustness when backfilling sparse data across varying frequencies in the GLB region?

The suggestions for using sentiment and tone in Q&A sessions are particularly intriguing. Have you explored combining changes in sentiment logits with management's numerical word usage as an additional signal of confidence or uncertainty?

This post is an excellent resource, and I look forward to experimenting with these ideas. Thanks again for this valuable guidance—looking forward to similar notes on other datasets!

Dynamic Weighting: Instead of static metrics, consider integrating time-varying weights for Profit Margin, Asset Turnover, and Equity Multiplier based on macroeconomic conditions or industry cycles.

Leverage Sensitivity: Explore alphas capturing changes in the Equity Multiplier across different leverage thresholds. Highly leveraged companies might exhibit different alpha behavior in volatile markets.

Industry-Specific Adjustments: Adjust Profit Margin components based on industry-specific norms (e.g., tech vs. manufacturing) to refine the group_zscore normalization.

Momentum & Mean Reversion: Combine ROE momentum with mean-reversion tendencies in Profit Margin or Asset Turnover to capture potential divergences.
