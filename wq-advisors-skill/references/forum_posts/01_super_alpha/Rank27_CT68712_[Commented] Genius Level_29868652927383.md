**After-Cost Combined Alpha Performance**  is a key metric used to assess the effectiveness of a trading strategy or investment model after accounting for costs such as transaction fees, slippage, and other operational costs. It essentially measures the real, net profitability of a strategy after all the costs involved in executing the trades have been deducted from the gross alpha (which is the raw return or excess return relative to a benchmark).

**After-Cost Combined Alpha Performance**  refers to the performance of an investment strategy, trading model, or alpha factor after accounting for all associated costs. These costs can include transaction costs (e.g., broker fees, slippage, commissions), management fees, and other expenses that may reduce the theoretical returns of a strategy when applied in the real world.

[VS18359](/hc/en-us/profiles/4730368641431-VS18359)  Previously, combined alpha performance did not take into account transaction costs. If you watched the webinar at the beginning of the year, there was a part where the WQ team said: 'if transaction costs are included, the returns of infinite alpha will be negative'. After-cost combined alpha performance has taken into account transaction costs, and some ways to increase this index are:
- Reduce turnover.
- Increase margin
- Increase returns.

To enhance this metric, consider:

- **Reducing Turnover:**  High turnover increases transaction costs, so optimizing execution and adjusting rebalance frequency can help.
- **Liquidity Management:**  Allocate capital evenly across liquidity buckets to avoid excessive costs from trading illiquid assets.
- **Risk-Neutralization Techniques:**  Using  `group_neutralize()`  or  `vector_neut()`  can help mitigate the impact of liquidity risk factors.
- **Strategic Order Execution:**  Minimizing market impact through better trade scheduling and execution algorithms can lower costs.

#### **What is After-Cost Combined Alpha Performance?**

After-Cost Combined Alpha Performance refers to the realized performance of a set of alpha signals after accounting for transaction costs such as slippage, bid-ask spreads, market impact, and execution fees. While raw alpha signals may look strong in simulations, real-world trading costs can significantly erode their profitability. The goal of optimizing After-Cost Alpha Performance is to design alphas that maintain their effectiveness while minimizing trading expenses.

### **Steps to Improve After-Cost Combined Alpha Performance**

#### **1. Reduce Turnover Without Losing Predictive Power**

- High turnover can lead to excessive trading costs, reducing net performance.
- Use  **longer-term signals**  to capture sustainable price movements instead of short-term fluctuations.
- Smooth signals using  **exponential moving averages (EMA)**  to avoid excessive trading on small price changes.

#### **2. Improve Signal Stability and Robustness**

- Use  **rank-based alphas**  instead of raw price differences to reduce noise and sudden position shifts.
- Apply  **neutralization techniques**  (e.g., sector or volatility neutralization) to make signals more stable across market conditions.

#### **3. Optimize Rebalancing Frequency**

- Rebalancing too frequently increases trading costs, while rebalancing too infrequently may lead to missed opportunities.
- Conduct  **cost-benefit analysis**  to find an optimal rebalancing schedule that balances performance and costs.

#### **4. Implement Smart Execution Strategies**

- Use  **VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price) or TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)**  execution to minimize market impact.
- Consider  **liquidity-aware trading**  to avoid executing large trades in illiquid stocks.

#### **5. Diversify Alphas to Reduce Correlation and Redundant Trading**

- Combining uncorrelated alphas can lead to smoother returns with fewer unnecessary position changes.
- Use  **cross-sectional ranking**  instead of absolute signals to ensure a balanced portfolio approach.

By focusing on signal robustness, trading efficiency, and execution optimization, one can significantly enhance After-Cost Combined Alpha Performance, leading to better real-world profitability.

### Steps to Boost After-Cost Combined Alpha Performance (ACC Alpha):

1. **Improve Model Alpha** :
   - **Refine Signal Generation** : Ensure the underlying alpha signals (factors driving returns) are robust and predictive. This can involve exploring new data sources, feature engineering, and better model selection techniques.
   - **Reduce Overfitting** : Ensure that the model is generalizing well to out-of-sample data and not overfitting to historical noise, which can lead to poor real-world performance.
   - **Use Alternative Data** : Incorporate more diverse and predictive datasets, such as satellite imagery, sentiment analysis, or alternative financial indicators, to improve alpha generation.
2. **Optimize Trading Strategy** :
   - **Reduce Turnover** : A high turnover rate (frequent trades) increases transaction costs. Strategies that are less reliant on high-frequency trading can lower these costs and thus improve after-cost alpha.
   - **Smarter Order Execution** : Use execution algorithms that minimize market impact and optimize trade size to avoid large slippage. Techniques such as  **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)** ,  **TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price)** , and  **smart routing**  help reduce market impact.
   - **Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA)** : Conduct thorough TCA to analyze the impact of trading costs on performance. By understanding the cost breakdown, you can adjust strategies to minimize these costs.
3. **Factor in Liquidity Constraints** :
   - **Liquidity Filtering** : Focus on liquid instruments with tight bid-ask spreads. Illiquid assets often have higher transaction costs due to greater slippage.
   - **Limit Large Orders** : Ensure that the model does not recommend excessively large positions that could cause significant market impact.
4. **Slippage Management** :
   - **Pre-Trade Analysis** : Estimate potential slippage before executing trades using historical data or predictive models.
   - **Limit Order Usage** : Where appropriate, use limit orders instead of market orders to reduce slippage, although this might impact execution speed.
5. **Dynamic Transaction Cost Models** :
   - **Adapt to Market Conditions** : Transaction costs, including slippage and liquidity, can vary with market conditions. Implement dynamic models that adjust trading behavior based on real-time market data, such as volatility, trading volume, and bid-ask spread conditions.
   - **Market Impact Modeling** : Build market impact models to better predict the effect of large trades and adjust positions dynamically.
6. **Leverage Execution Algorithms** :
   - **Adaptive Algorithms** : Use algorithms that adjust the size and timing of trades based on real-time market conditions. These algorithms aim to minimize execution cost and improve overall performance.
   - **Multi-Strategy Execution** : Combine different types of trading algorithms to reduce the risk of front-running or adverse market movements when executing large trades.
7. **Monitoring and Backtesting** :
   - **Continuous Backtesting with Transaction Costs** : Always backtest strategies with realistic transaction costs to understand their potential after-cost performance. Adjust for changes in cost structures over time.
   - **Iterative Improvement** : Continuously monitor and iterate the model to ensure that the after-cost alpha remains strong. This includes improving factors related to execution and adjusting models as market conditions evolve.

4. **Blend Smartly** : Combine alphas with complementary styles to balance performance and costs.
5. **Think Long-Term** : Medium- to long-term alphas tend to have lower costs than high-frequency strategies.
6. **Use Cost Models** : Simulate transaction costs during alpha testing to design more efficient signals.
7. **Refine Regularly** : Replace underperforming alphas and tweak parameters to improve stability.
