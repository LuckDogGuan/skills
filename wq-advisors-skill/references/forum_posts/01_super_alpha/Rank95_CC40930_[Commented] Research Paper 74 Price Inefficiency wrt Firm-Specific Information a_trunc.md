**Abstract**

I develop a Price Efficiency wrt Firm-specific Information (PEFI) measure motivated by the momentum theory literature and examine its relation with 205 momentum and other anomalies. The crossover interaction term between the anomaly variable and PEFI completely subsumes the return predictability of more than 70 percent of anomaly variables that still predict returns in recent data and significantly weakens the return predictability for an additional 10 percent. Results are stronger for last two decades. The empirical evidence suggests that incorrect incorporation of firm-specific information into prices lies at the core of the return predictability of most prevalent asset market anomalies.

Hi,

Thank you for the great paper.

Since mdf_prm is not currently available in BRAIN datafields when trying the search functions,

Can we use some alternative datasets from Model Data to reflect the momentum such as:

1. From Fundamentals and Technical Indicators Model (model109) with the following datafield:
a. mdl109_d252_ntr (Price Momentum, 12M)
b. mdl109_d981_ntr (Price Momentum, 9M)
c. mdl109_d621_ntr (Price Momentum, 6M)
d. mdl109_m1m21_ntr (Price Momentum, 12M-1M)

2. From Stock Reports Plus (model56) with the following datafield:
a. srp_price_momentum_score (price momentum score)

In Region GLB, Delay 1?

Thank you.

Hi!

Absolutely, the datasets listed in the post are just recommendations and alternatives can be used. If mdf_prm isn't available, the alternative datasets from Model Data, specifically from model109, can be used to reflect momentum.

The model109 datasets capture price momentum over different periods and can indeed be used to generate momentum-based trading signals.

Remember, many of these ideas can be applied across different regions, including USA and GLB. So, keep exploring and innovating! 😊

Hey,  [TN67143](/hc/en-us/profiles/14032371578903-TN67143) ! That's a good thought. Yeah, when mdf_prm isn't available in BRAIN datafields, those alternative datasets you mentioned can be used to reflect momentum. For example, the ones from model109 like mdl109_d252_ntr, mdl109_d981_ntr, etc., and from model56 like srp_price_momentum_score. Just keep in mind to test them thoroughly in your strategies to see how well they perform compared to what you initially aimed for. Good luck!

By leveraging alternative momentum datasets like model109 or model56, we can better explore these dynamics. Have you found any specific strategies that amplify the predictive power of anomalies when using these alternative datasets?

Regarding the SSRN link issue, it seems there might be a temporary network problem or an issue with the URL itself. I recommend checking the link's validity and trying again later. If the problem persists, it could be due to temporary issues on the platform's side. Either way, I'm here to help you explore the ideas from the paper without relying on the link.

As for your question about alternative datasets to reflect momentum when mdf_prm is not available, absolutely, you can use datasets from Model Data to capture momentum. The datasets you mentioned from model109, such as mdl109_d252_ntr (Price Momentum, 12M), mdl109_d981_ntr (Price Momentum, 9M), and mdl109_d621_ntr (Price Momentum, 6M), can be used to generate momentum-based trading signals. Additionally, the dataset from model56, srp_price_momentum_score, which provides a price momentum score, can also be a valuable resource.

Hey, this research paper by Bharat Raj Parajuli is quite interesting. The PEFI measure it develops based on momentum theory is really something. It shows how the crossover interaction term with anomaly variables impacts return predictability. When it comes to key data fields like returns and the Price Volume Data for Equity, they're crucial for analyzing these effects. The mdf_prm model data might also play an important role in further exploring the relation between PEFI and those anomalies. It's definitely worth digging deeper into those pointed-out pages to understand better.

The Price Efficiency with respect to Firm-specific Information (PEFI) measure, inspired by momentum theory, evaluates how effectively individual stock prices reflect company-specific data. By analyzing PEFI's interaction with 205 momentum and other anomalies, researchers aim to understand its impact on return predictability.

### 评论 #11 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

The interaction term between anomaly variables and PEFI significantly influences return predictability. Empirical evidence indicates that this interaction subsumes the return predictability of over 70% of anomaly variables that previously forecasted returns, suggesting that PEFI plays a crucial role in asset pricing models.

---

### 评论 #12 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

In addition to subsuming return predictability for a majority of anomalies, the PEFI-anomaly interaction term notably weakens the return predictability for an additional 10% of anomaly variables. This finding underscores the pervasive influence of firm-specific information efficiency on various market anomalies.

### 评论 #13 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

The impact of PEFI on anomaly return predictability has intensified over the past two decades. This trend suggests that as markets evolve, the efficient incorporation of firm-specific information into stock prices becomes increasingly critical in understanding and potentially mitigating asset market anomalies.

### 评论 #14 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

The empirical evidence implies that many prevalent asset market anomalies may stem from the incorrect incorporation of firm-specific information into stock prices. This mispricing could lead to predictable return patterns, challenging the Efficient Market Hypothesis and highlighting areas where market efficiency can be improved.
