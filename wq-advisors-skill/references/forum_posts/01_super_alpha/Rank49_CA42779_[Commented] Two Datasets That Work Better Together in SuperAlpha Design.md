## 帖子正文

Looking to build stronger, more stable SuperAlphas? Sometimes the secret isn’t in a fancy formula — it’s in combining the  **right datasets**  that capture different dimensions of market behavior.

Here are two powerful datasets that  **synergize extremely well** :

### 🔹 1.  `fundamental6`  — Deep Company Financials

This dataset offers rich signals like ROE, gross margins, earnings yield, and leverage ratios — perfect for building  **quality, value, and profitability signals** .

- ✅ Captures  **slow-moving fundamentals**  that drive long-term returns
- ✅ Low turnover, OS-friendly
- ✅ Great for themes like capital efficiency, margin expansion, or valuation re-rating

### 🔹 2.  `pv3`  — Price & Volatility Signals

Includes 1-day to 252-day price returns, moving averages, volatility measures, and more — ideal for  **timing, risk, and structural behavior**  of price.

- ✅ Useful for adding  **risk filters** , signal confirmation, or breakout detection
- ✅ Pairs well with fundamental signals to  **improve entry/exit timing**
- ✅ Enables low-correlation enhancement of slow-moving indicators

### 💡 Why They Work So Well Together

- `fundamental6`  gives you the  **"what to buy"** ,
- `pv3`  helps determine  **"when and how" to act** .
  This combo creates  **alpha that’s both smart and tradable**  — quality signals with built-in risk awareness and timing logic.

What are your favorite dataset pairs for building resilient SuperAlphas?
Let’s crowdsource some underrated combinations 👇

Great post! I really like how you highlighted the synergy between  `fundamental6`  and  `pv3`  — combining deep fundamentals with price-based timing makes a lot of sense for building tradable, stable SuperAlphas. I’d like to propose adding a third dataset into the mix:  `estimize` , which brings in forward-looking expectations from the crowd. For example, we could design an alpha that selects stocks with high ROE ( `fundamental6` ), low volatility ( `pv3` ), and improving EPS forecasts ( `estimize` ). This layered approach helps identify fundamentally strong companies that are underpriced and gaining positive sentiment. To refine the signal, we could apply  `group_rank`  by sector and use  `limit_volume`  to enhance investability. Combining quality, risk control, and market expectations can create alphas that are both robust and execution-friendly. Would love to hear how others are blending these datasets to uncover edge!

This pairing makes a lot of sense — it’s like aligning conviction with precision. fundamental6 lays the structural foundation, and pv3 provides the tactical finesse. I’ve also seen interesting results when layering  `analyst_8`  on top of fundamental6 for sentiment confirmation.

Curious — have you experimented with adding  `others128`  into the mix? Especially for regions with lower data density, it sometimes brings unique cross-sectional signals that fundamental-pv3 alone might miss.

Sorry to bother you — is it OK to use a wide variety of mixed data sets when creating Super Alphas, or is there anything else I should be aware of?

This is a solid combo — pairing  **fundamental6**  with  **pv3**  really balances signal strength and timing finesse. I’ve found that using fundamental6 to anchor long-term conviction and pv3 to finesse entries/exits minimizes whipsaws while keeping the portfolio aligned with structural trends. Another underrated pair I’ve been exploring is  **valuation_ratios**  with  **alpha101**  — lots of potential when you want to blend classic fundamentals with quirky price behavior. Curious to hear what others are experimenting with!

Combining fundamental6 and pv3 is indeed a powerful strategy for enhancing SuperAlpha design, as it effectively integrates long-term value signals with dynamic price behavior. Another compelling pair to consider is fundamental5, which focuses on earnings revisions and growth forecasts, alongside sentiment data from sentiment1. This combination allows for a comprehensive view of market expectations and investor sentiment, providing insights into potential price movements. By leveraging the predictive power of earnings revisions with real-time sentiment shifts, you can create a more responsive alpha that captures both fundamental strength and market psychology, ultimately leading to more robust trading strategies.

Really appreciate this breakdown — fundamental6 and pv3 are a smart pairing, especially for building conviction-driven signals with precise execution timing. I’ve also seen strong results combining fundamental8 (cash flow metrics) with tech2 (technical flow signals). Using free cash flow margins as the anchor and layering in short-term accumulation triggers has helped reduce drawdowns and avoid value traps, particularly during sideways markets. This kind of hybrid design adds both stability and responsiveness to SuperAlphas.

Great post! Combining fundamental6 and pv3 really makes sense — you get strong conviction from fundamentals and precise timing from price signals. I’ve found that adding sentiment data like sentiment1 or analyst_8 can make the alpha more adaptive and robust.

Has anyone experimented with lagging fundamental data or mixing datasets differently to reduce signal overlap? I’d love to hear more ideas!

I usually use the whole alpha instead of separating it into components like you guys. Using the super combo function and calculating each parameter in detail can improve daily money and weight.

Combining fundamental6 and pv3 smartly balances what to buy and when to buy, creating robust, low-turnover SuperAlphas with strong timing and risk edges!

Fantastic insight! The pairing of  `fundamental6`  and  `pv3`  is indeed a classic blend of strategic conviction and tactical precision. I’ve found that layering in  **group-neutralization**  (e.g., sector or country) when combining these datasets significantly improves cross-sectional signal robustness. One approach I’ve used is applying  `group_rank(fundamental6.roe)`  within sectors, then filtering with  `pv3.volatility < threshold`  to isolate stable performers. You can also test  **asymmetric decay**  on the pv3 side—e.g., using 5-day vs. 60-day momentum—to differentiate signal timing for entries vs exits. Curious if anyone has tried combining this with  **turnover caps**  during alpha simulation to further enhance after-cost performance?

Combining  **fundamental6**  with  **pv3**  merges long-term value signals and price dynamics for stronger SuperAlpha design. Similarly, pairing  **fundamental5**  (earnings revisions and growth forecasts) with  **sentiment1**  adds insight into market expectations and sentiment, creating responsive alphas that blend fundamentals with real-time psychology for improved strategy performance.
