Hi  [AS29868](/hc/en-us/profiles/22379131461143-AS29868) , These reduce operators are available only for combo expressions, not for regular alpha submissions. If you are submitting a super alpha, you will then have access to use reduce operators within your combo expressions.

Hi  [AS29868](/hc/en-us/profiles/22379131461143-AS29868)

You can use the reduce operator only in a Super Alpha Combo Expression. I believe you're attempting to use it in a Regular Alpha Expression, which is why you're unable to use the reduce operator.

Hi AS29868, Reduce operators are only available for super alpha (combo expressions) and cannot be used in regular alpha submissions.

it works similar to reducing dimension from vector to matrix, now change stock dimension to alpha, also value and time dimension

You can only use reduce operators on self corr data in combo expressions. Also cannot be used in selection and regular alpha

Hi  [AS29868](/hc/en-us/profiles/22379131461143-AS29868)

You can try using the reduce operator in a combo expression for super alpha. For example, with the reduce max operator:

`stats = generate_stats(alpha);  
innerCorr = self_corr(stats.returns, 500);  
ic = if_else(innerCorr == 1.0, nan, innerCorr);  
maxCorr = reduce_max(ic);  
1 - maxCorr  
`

This expression assigns weights to each Alpha based on the maximum correlation it has with all other selected Alphas over a two-year period. Alphas with higher correlations are assigned lower weights.

Hi  @SM58724

"Good to know! So, to clarify, reduce operators are only available for combo expressions within super alpha submissions, and not for regular alpha submissions. Thanks for pointing out this important distinction!"

For the list of operators in the "Reduce" group, you can refer to the  **learn/operators**  section. In the Scope column in the table, you will see the Scope of these operators is "Combo", which means you can only use these operators in the "Combo Expression" section to simulate  **Super Alphas** .

In addition, in the / **learn/documentation/superalpha/combo-expression**  section, the system also provides sample examples of Combo Expressions using reduce operators that you can refer to, for example:

stats = generate_stats(alpha); innerCorr = self_corr(stats.returns, 500); ic = if_else(innerCorr == 1.0, nan, innerCorr); maxCorr =  **reduce_max** (ic); 1 - maxCorr

Hope it helps you

The  **reduce**  operator is a powerful tool for aggregating data across multiple dimensions, but its availability depends on your Genius level and dataset permissions. If it’s visible in the Learn section but inaccessible, it could be due to restrictions tied to your account level or region-specific datasets.

For  **2D and 3D data fields** , these typically involve matrices or tensors, like time-series data across multiple assets or sectors. These fields are often found in datasets focused on multi-dimensional financial data (e.g., correlation matrices or rolling factor exposures).

To access and use the  **reduce**  operator:

1. Verify your Genius level and dataset permissions.
2. Consult your advisor to confirm if this feature is available for your account.
3. If access is limited, explore alternative operators that might achieve similar results, like  `aggregate`  or  `group_rank` .

If anyone has experience working with 2D/3D data fields or bypassing such limitations, feel free to share your insights!

Hi  [AS29868](/hc/en-us/profiles/22379131461143-AS29868)

Just go through operators page in learn section and you will be able to see that you can only use reduce operator in Super Alpha Combo Expression .

How do you calibrate the rough Bergomi volatility model for pricing exotic derivatives, and what are the challenges in estimating fractional Brownian motion-driven volatility surfaces?

Make sure you're using the correct version of the library or tool where the reduce operator is supposed to be available. Sometimes, certain features may be accessible only in specific versions of the software or library you're using.

These principles form the backbone of any long-term, successful investment strategy. By ensuring that your strategy is  **adaptive**  to market changes,  **diversified**  across multiple risk factors and asset classes, and  **mindful**  of transaction and management costs, you can maximize the likelihood of achieving consistent returns and minimizing the risks of drawdowns.

**Signal Cleaning** : This technique can be useful when you want to  **filter out irrelevant data**  in alpha generation models. For example, if you're working with momentum strategies, you might want to keep only the days where price momentum is positive and ignore the rest.

**`ts_mean(close, 120)`** : This computes the 120-day average of the stock's closing price. By smoothing the price over a longer time period, it helps to reduce the effect of short-term price fluctuations and provides a more stable measure of the stock's trend.

- **Stocks with high  `vol_trend`**  may be considered to have stronger upward momentum or favorable predictive characteristics.
- **Neutralization**  ensures that subindustry trends don't skew the signals, and the final ranking should reflect more intrinsic stock characteristics.

**Sentiment Analysis** : Implement  **Sentiment Analysis**  using models like  **VADER**  (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) for financial sentiment, or more advanced models like  **BERT**  if you have the computational resources.

**Regression Models** : Begin with simple models like  **linear regression**  to predict stock prices or asset returns. As you grow, explore more advanced models such as  **ARIMA**  for time-series forecasting or  **machine learning models**  for prediction.

The  **reduce operator**  in WorldQuant BRAIN is available only for  **Super Alpha Combo Expressions**  and cannot be used in  **regular Alpha submissions** . If you're unable to access it, it's likely because you're trying to use it in a standard alpha instead of a Super Alpha.

Regarding  **2D and 3D data fields** , these are typically used in  **multi-dimensional financial datasets** , such as:

- **2D:**  Time-series data across multiple stocks
- **3D:**  Factor exposure matrices, correlation matrices, or multi-sector data

You can use the reduce operator only in a Super Alpha Combo Expression not for regular alpha submissions. If you are submitting a super alpha, you will then have access to use reduce operators within your combo expressions.

For Example:

```
stats = generate_stats(alpha);ic = reduce_norm(self_corr(stats.returns, 120));    1/(1+ic)
```

It sounds like you're encountering some challenges with the reduce operator. It could be helpful to look into the specific requirements or permissions needed to access that feature. Also, regarding 2D and 3D data fields, they often depend on the context or framework you are using. Could you provide more details about the platform or application you are working with? This might help clarify the issues.

Optimizing operator selection is key to refining alpha construction. Focus on high-impact signals, removing redundant operators, and leveraging PCA to retain only the most influential ones. Simplify factor combinations by clustering related elements and using a single representative operator per group. Pre-screen operators through correlation analysis to eliminate those that add little value or duplicate existing signals.

It’s worth checking the specific requirements or permissions needed to access that feature. Additionally, the use of 2D and 3D data fields often depends on the context or framework being used. Could you share more details about the platform or application you're working with? This would help in identifying potential issues and finding the best solution.

It looks like the confusion around the reduce operator is common, especially since it's only accessible in super alpha combo expressions. This limitation can definitely impact how you structure your submissions. As you work towards creating a super alpha, what specific strategies or combinations are you considering to effectively leverage the reduce operator, and how do you think it will enhance your overall alpha generation?
