## 帖子正文

Linear regression is a statistical method that helps to understand the relationship between two variables, usually denoted as `x` (independent variable) and `y` (dependent variable).

Linear regression uses the equation `y = ax + b + error`, where `a` is the slope (showing the effect of `x` on `y`), `b` is the y-intercept, and `error` is the residual or unexplained variance.

In the context of time-series analysis, you might use linear regression to understand and seek to predict future data points. Here's how you can apply it:

### Time-series Linear Regression

Set x as ts_step(1):

```
ts_regression(y, ts_step(1), d, lag=0, rettype)
```

Here, ts_step(1) generates a sequence of time steps, d is the window over which the regression is calculated, and  [rettype](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/operators/detailed-operator-descriptions#ts_regressiony-x-d-lag-0-rettype-0) specifies the type of value returned by the function. Depending on the rettype value, the function can return a prediction of y (rettype=3), the slope (rettype=2), the error term (rettype=0), or the y-intercept (rettype=1).

### Auto-Regression

Auto-regression uses a variable's past values to determine its future values. The lag parameter is essential for this. For example, to determine x based on its own past values, use:

```
ts_regression(x, x, d, lag=1, rettype)
```

Here, lag=1 indicates that the function should use the previous value of x to determine its next value.

### Linear Regression Between Two Variables

You can also use linear regression to understand how well one variable explains another. For instance, to see how x explains y, use:

```
ts_regression(y, x, d, lag=0, rettype)
```

As an example, to find the market beta, which measures a stock's volatility in relation to the market:

```
ts_regression(returns, group_mean(returns, 1, market), 252, lag=0, rettype=2)
```

Here, group_mean(returns,1,market) calculates the average market return, and rettype=2 indicates that the function should return the slope of the regression line, which is the market beta in this case.

### Predicting `y` Using `x`

To predict y using x, use x, y, and lag>0. For instance,

```
a = ts_regression(ts_product(1 + returns, 5) - 1, x, 63, lag=6, rettype=1)b = ts_regression(ts_product(1 + returns, 5) - 1, x, 63, lag=6, rettype=2)a + b*x  # This is the prediction of returns
```

To learn more about what ts_product(1 + returns, 5) - 1 means, check out post  [4 ways to calculate returns]([L2] 4 ways for you to calculate returnsResearch_23977710448663.md)

### Manually Creating a Linear Regression

Linear regression parameters can also be calculated manually using the formulas for a and b.

```
b = (n * sum(x*y) - sum(x) * sum(y)) / (n * sum(x^2) - sum(x)^2)a = mean(y) - b * mean(x)
```

Here, ts_sum and ts_mean operators can be used to find the sum and mean of a sequence.

what is the meaning of ts_step? like could you please elucidate on what a time step is? Thanks in advance!

Hi  [SK72105](/hc/en-us/profiles/8203727051799-SK72105) !

Thank you for your question.

`ts_step(n)`  serves as a day counter in simulations.

- **Outside  `ts_operator`** : it simply returns  `n` .
- **Inside  `ts_operator`** : it returns  `n`  for today,  `n-1`  for yesterday,  `n-2`  for the day before, and so on.

For example:

`ts_sum(x * ts_step(n), n)`  calculates as:

```
x * n + ts_delay(x, 1) * (n-1) + ... + ts_delay(x, n-1) * 1
```

Hi LI36776!

Thank you for the question. Here are some examples:

1. You can use the above formula as a starting point for modifications. For example you can substitute ts_mean with ts_decay_linear to put more weight on recent observations.
2. You can use this formula to build cross-sectional regression (by using group_sum and group_mean). To find number of observations (n) you can use group_count operator.
3. Furthermore you can use both time-series and group by combining ts_sum and group_sum. :

b = (group_count(x, group)*d * group_sum(ts_sum(x*y, d), group) - group_sum(ts_sum(x,d) * ..and so on. - Here you'll need to think about how to handle NaNs correctly.

This is a thoughtful and detailed approach, skillfully combining time-series and group-based aggregations while considering the importance of recent data and proper handling of NaNs.

Thank you

Hi TN48752!

You can nest regressions, but you can not achieve neural network model because you can't train model using expressions.

### 评论 #10 (作者: TT55495, 时间: 1年前)

As I understand the effects of tanh and sigmoid are as follows

Sigmoid: The sigmoid function has an output value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification problems. However, it has the vanishing gradient problem, when the output value is close to 0 or 1, the gradient is very small, slowing down the learning process.

Tanh: The tanh function has an output value between -1 and 1, which helps to neutralize the input values ​​around 0. This helps to reduce the vanishing gradient problem more than sigmoid, but can also encounter the same problem if the input value is too large.

However, when nesting these 2 functions into ts_regression, I almost do not see any improvement for alpha. Why does this happen? Looking forward to receiving an answer

[TN48752](/hc/en-us/profiles/13714359745431-TN48752)  for me ts_vector_neut, and proj work for lookback periods till ~350 (although they take a lot of time) and have worked in AMR, KOR, JPN, and TWN. Haven't tried using it in larger universes like GLB/ASI MINVOL1M, and USA Top3000

### 评论 #18 (作者: HS48991, 时间: 1年前)

Hi,

Linear regression is a method used to understand the relationship between two variables:  `x`  (independent) and  `y`  (dependent). The basic equation is  `y = ax + b + error` , where  `a`  is the slope, showing how  `x`  affects  `y` , and  `b`  is the y-intercept.

In time-series analysis, you can use linear regression to predict future values. For example, with the function  `ts_regression(y, ts_step(1), d, lag=0, rettype)` , you can predict  `y`  using time steps as  `x` . The  `lag`  controls how much past data influences the prediction.

You can also use regression to examine how one variable influences another. For example, to calculate the  **market beta** , you can regress a stock’s returns against the market’s returns to see how much the stock moves with the market.

Additionally, manual calculations for  `a`  and  `b`  use formulas based on sums and means of data.

This post provides a clear explanation of how linear regression can be applied in time-series analysis, especially in the context of financial data. The breakdown of different scenarios, such as using linear regression for auto-regression or between two variables, is helpful for understanding its application. I particularly appreciate the example of calculating market beta, as it highlights a practical use of regression in financial analysis.

I think it would be interesting to also discuss potential pitfalls when using linear regression in time-series data, such as issues related to stationarity or autocorrelation, which can affect the model's assumptions. Looking forward to the post about the ts_partial_corr operator!

Hi  [TN48752](/hc/en-us/profiles/13714359745431-TN48752) ! Operators like ts_theisen, ts_vector_neut, ts_vector_proj are more computationally intensive. Take ts_vector_neut for example, it will perform vector neutralization on the time series vector for each stock, before taking the latest date's value as the output for each stock.

Thanks for the advice! I’ll keep it in mind and focus on a more streamlined approach for future submissions, especially considering the constraints on the alphas I’ve already submitted. I also appreciate the useful information you shared about efficiently using the  `ts_regression`  operator and other relevant topics

### 评论 #23 (作者: CS12450, 时间: 1年前)

Linear regression helps analyze the relationship between two variables,  `x`  (independent) and  `y`  (dependent). In time-series, you can use  `ts_regression`  to predict future values or assess correlations. The slope ( `a` ) indicates the relationship's strength, while the intercept ( `b` ) shows where the line crosses the y-axis. You can also apply auto-regression or analyze relationships between two variables, such as calculating market beta.

### 评论 #24 (作者: ND68030, 时间: 1年前)

Thank you for sharing. In linear regression, multicollinearity is a key issue, especially when there are multiple independent variables in the model. When the independent variables are strongly correlated with each other, this can cause instability in the estimation of the regression coefficients, reducing the reliability of the results
