## 帖子正文

The data field  **`mws59_event_time_value`**  is described as having  **86% coverage**  in the dataset documentation. However, an examination of the raw data shows that  **approximately 76% of the entries are NaN** , leaving only  **about 24% non-NULL values** .

This leads to a clarification question:

👉  **How should the reported “coverage” be interpreted in this context?**

Does coverage indicate the percentage of instruments that have at least one valid observation at any point in history, rather than the consistency or density of data across time? If that is the case, it would explain why a field can show high coverage while still being very sparse in day-to-day observations.

Any clarification on how coverage is defined and best practices for interpreting it would be appreciated.

Coverage refers to the breadth of instruments, not time density.

An 86% coverage means 86% of securities have at least one valid observation at some point in history. It does not imply frequent or daily availability. Event fields often show high coverage yet remain temporally sparse.

Here is the simplest way to understand why the "Coverage" is high (86%) but the raw data looks empty (76% NaN):

Imagine you are looking at your bank statement.

1. The Raw Data (Events): You only see rows for days where you actually bought something (e.g., Coffee, Rent, Netflix). Most days are blank (NaN) because you didn't spend money. This is sparse.
2. The Coverage (State): Even though you didn't buy coffee today, you still have a Bank Balance today. Your balance "covers" every single day, carrying over the number from the last time you spent money.

What is happening in WQB: The documentation is likely telling you, "We know the 'balance' for 86% of these stocks" (because you can forward-fill the previous value). However, when you look at the raw data, you are only seeing the "transactions" that is, the specific moments new information arrived.

Just a hunch!

Coverage describes how wide the data spans across instruments, not how often values appear through time. When a field shows 86% coverage, it simply means that 86% of securities have at least one valid data point somewhere in the historical record. It does  **not**  imply that the field is populated regularly or on a daily basis. This is why event-driven fields can report high coverage while still being extremely sparse in time—many names are touched eventually, but updates occur infrequently and irregularly.
