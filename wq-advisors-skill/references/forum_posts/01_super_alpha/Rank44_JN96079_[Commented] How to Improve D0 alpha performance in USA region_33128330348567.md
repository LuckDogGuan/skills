Any suggestion to create alphas in D0 because it is very tough for me to create alphas in these regions!

Creating alphas in D0 can definitely be challenging due to the data constraints and high noise. I'd suggest focusing on simple, interpretable signals using robust datasets like price-volume or technical indicators. Try emphasizing stability and smoothness in your time-series transformations. Also, analyzing what worked historically in D1 and simplifying it for D0 can help. Keep iterating—small changes often lead to breakthroughs!

If u see in USA delay 0 in this format of all type of data that given in USA region

Region    Universe    Language    Decay    Delay    Truncation    Neutralization    Pasteurization    NaN Handling    Unit Handling
USA    TOP1000    Fast Expression    0    0    0.08    Subindustry    On    Off    Verify
Momentum after news
Hypothesis

After news is released, if a stock takes a longer time to rise, it may show strong evidence of upward momentum, and it could be beneficial to take a long position in it.

Implementation

Use the data field 'nws12_prez_4l' to capture this hypothesis. Backfill it with two years of data to ensure there is no drop in coverage

Yes, D0 universes are often tough because they are smaller, noisier, and more volatile compared to broad global ones, so the signals don’t generalize easily. A good way to start is to focus on  **short-horizon features**  like liquidity, volume shocks, intraday volatility, and short-interest data since these react quickly and tend to show stronger effects in smaller universes. Combining them with light smoothing (short decay windows, low half-lives) can stabilize performance. Also, try  **group-neutralization**  by industry or size, because D0 markets often have heavy sector skews that distort signals. Another tip is to explore  **alternative datasets**  (analyst revisions, sentiment, news) because raw price-volume patterns may be overused.

You can try creating signals in delay 1 first, ensuring they are strong. After that, if the data fields you have used in delay 1 are available in delay 0, then you can shift the signal to delay 0 by changing the setting from 1 to 0. If the data fields are not available, try a similar one, as all data fields have descriptions, making it easy to find related ones.

If the same performing delay 1 signal isn't performing well in delay 0, try checking the settings. For example, you can reduce decay or neutralize the signal with higher neutralizations, as Statistical usually work well with most of my delay 0 signals.

To improve D0 alphas, start with fundamental datasets like close,open,volume,adv20,high,low
