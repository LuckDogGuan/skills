When the platform calculates the alpha backtest PnL curve, does it take into account transaction costs and slippage?

I haven’t been able to find any relevant explanation.

If anyone has insight into this, I would really appreciate you sharing. Thank you!

The Brain/WebSim simulator calculates your alpha's PnL by assigning portfolio weights to stocks each day based on your signal, then measuring the returns of those weighted positions. The resulting PnL curve represents the  *theoretical gross profit*  of that weighting scheme — it is not net of brokerage commissions, bid-ask spread, or market impact slippage. These costs are not explicitly subtracted from the curve.

Hi DT49505, that's a crucial question for realistic alpha backtesting! Generally, WorldQuant BRAIN's platform *does* account for transaction costs and slippage to provide a more accurate PnL curve, though the exact model might not be publicly detailed. It's always a good practice to test your alpha's robustness under various cost/slippage scenarios if the platform allows for that customization.

Hi DT49505, that's a crucial point for realistic backtesting! Generally, BRAIN's platform *does* attempt to model transaction costs and slippage to provide a more accurate PnL curve. You'll often find parameters within the backtest settings that allow you to adjust these assumptions, reflecting typical market conditions. It's definitely worth checking the detailed documentation or experimenting with different cost settings to see their impact on your alpha's performance.

KP is spot on here. Just to clarify the other points: Brain's raw PnL curve and Sharpe ratio do  *not*  explicitly deduct slippage or commissions. However, the platform accounts for these real-world frictions indirectly through the  **Fitness**  metric. Fitness heavily penalizes high turnover precisely because high-frequency trading eats your returns in live execution. The PnL looks perfect, but the Fitness score tells you if it's actually tradable. Have you ever had an alpha with a massive Sharpe get rejected purely because its turnover dragged the Fitness score below the submittable threshold?

I found that GrandMaster JC84638’s Medium article is also a masterpiece that helps us understand the complexity of the system. Of course, his comments on cost control in the Taiwan forum are also exceptionally sharp.

I’d love to be one of the core followers. (nok

Hi DT49505, that's a really critical question for any alpha development! Generally, platform backtests often make simplifying assumptions and might not fully capture realistic transaction costs and slippage unless explicitly configured. For a true picture of an alpha's viability, especially for high-frequency strategies, you'll likely need to incorporate these factors yourself or understand the platform's specific methodologies. Have you looked into whether there are any parameters for setting custom cost/slippage models in the platform's backtesting engine?

Properly factoring in transaction costs and slippage is essential for any realistic backtest. On BRAIN, PnL calculations generally  *do*  include simulated costs and slippage based on the settings defined for your universe and trading approach. If the results appear unusually strong, it’s a good idea to revisit those assumptions and verify that your execution parameters are set appropriately.
