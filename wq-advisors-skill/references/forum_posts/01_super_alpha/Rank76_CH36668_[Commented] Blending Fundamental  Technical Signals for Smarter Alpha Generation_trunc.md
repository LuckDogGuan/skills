🚀  **Introduction** 
In quantitative finance, traders often debate  **fundamental vs. technical analysis** , but why choose one when you can blend both? Combining fundamental indicators like earnings growth with technical factors such as momentum can unlock  **stronger and more resilient alphas** .

📊  **Why Combine Fundamental & Technical Signals?**

- **Fundamentals provide long-term value insights**  (e.g., undervalued stocks with strong earnings).
- **Technical indicators capture short-term price action**  (e.g., breakout momentum or mean reversion signals).
- **Hybrid models adapt to different market conditions** , reducing overfitting to specific regimes.

💡  **Example Alpha Idea: Fundamental Momentum Hybrid**

### **1. Factor Selection**

- **Earnings Momentum** : Identify stocks with  **positive earnings revisions**  over the past quarter.
- **Price Momentum** : Select assets with  **strong relative strength vs. industry peers** .
- **Liquidity Adjustments** : Normalize signals by trading volume to avoid small-cap noise.

### **2. Alpha Formula Implementation**

Using a  **grouped z-score approach** , we can construct a hybrid alpha:

α=group_zscore(earnings_growth)+group_zscore(momentum_12m)\alpha = \text{group\_zscore}(\text{earnings\_growth}) + \text{group\_zscore}(\text{momentum\_12m})

This captures both  **fundamental strength and technical trends** , making it robust across different market conditions.

📌  **Optimization & Testing**

- **Cross-validate across different market regimes**  to ensure robustness.
- **Apply decay functions**  to dynamically adjust weightings when one signal weakens.
- **Explore machine learning models**  (e.g., decision trees) to  **dynamically switch between factors**  based on market state.

💬  **Discussion Prompt** 
What are your thoughts on blending fundamentals with technical signals? Have you experimented with hybrid strategies in your alpha research? Share your insights below! 🔥📉

Great post! Blending fundamentals (e.g., earnings momentum) with technicals (e.g., price momentum) creates more resilient alphas. A grouped z-score approach captures both long-term value and short-term trends, adapting to different market regimes. Optimizing with cross-validation, decay functions, or machine learning further enhances robustness. Consider dynamic weighting, as signal strength may shift across cycles.

###### A grouped z-score approach effectively balances long-term value with short-term trends, adjusting to various market regimes. Optimizing this method through  **cross-validation** ,  **decay functions** , or  **machine learning**  enhances signal robustness. Dynamic weighting is crucial, as signal effectiveness fluctuates across different market cycles. By incorporating  **price momentum**  from technical analysis and  **earnings momentum**  from fundamentals, alphas become more resilient to changing conditions. This fusion of diverse factors strengthens predictive power and mitigates overfitting. Refining signals through adaptive weighting, feature selection, and rigorous validation ensures that the alpha remains stable, capturing meaningful market inefficiencies over time for better trading performance.

Your post effectively explains the power of hybrid strategies, but here are some refinements:

✅  **Stronger Hook**  – Start with a real-world success case of hybrid alphas.
✅  **Formula Clarity**  – Break down and format the equation for better readability.
✅  **More Examples**  – Add variations like value + momentum or sentiment + price action.
✅  **Engagement Boost**  – Ask about challenges in blending signals.

Great insights overall!

Instead of a static blend, using a volatility-adjusted weighting scheme can optimize hybrid alphas. During high-volatility periods, fundamentals may be more stable, while in trending markets, momentum may dominate. A dynamic weighting approach can improve adaptability.

### 评论 #8 (作者: DD24306, 时间: 1年前)

I suggest using this approach with the  **Data Analyst dataset** , as it provides a rich set of both  **fundamental and technical metrics** , making it ideal for constructing and validating hybrid signals. This can help refine factor selection and improve signal stability.

One challenge I’ve faced in hybrid models is ensuring that fundamental and technical factors aren’t just proxies for the same underlying effect. For example, strong earnings growth often correlates with price momentum. I try using orthogonalization techniques or PCA to ensure each factor adds unique predictive power.

### 评论 #12 (作者: DS39810, 时间: 1年前)

One way to test the robustness of a hybrid alpha is by stress-testing it across different market regimes. Running rolling out-of-sample tests or using walk-forward optimization ensures the strategy remains effective across various cycles. Additionally, integrating sentiment data (e.g., news or earnings call sentiment) can complement fundamental and technical factors by capturing investor perception, especially during earnings season or market stress.

Together, these strategies provide a framework for identifying high-potential stocks with solid fundamentals, dependable liquidity, and market momentum. This lowers risk and increases rewards by enabling you to more precisely capture alpha. These suggestions are unquestionably a fantastic method for creating quality alphas!

### 评论 #15 (作者: TN10210, 时间: 1年前)

Technical analysis can also predict the long-term insights too, and for me, it is especially useful. But anyway, it will always be good if we can combine both fundamental and technical analysis in our strategy though, everyone knows it

While hybrid models reduce reliance on a single signal, they can still suffer from overfitting if too many features are used without robust validation. A walk-forward optimization framework where models are retrained on past data and tested on future data can help. Rolling out-of-sample testing and cross-validation across multiple market regimes can further ensure robustness.

### 评论 #17 (作者: SS63636, 时间: 1年前)

Blending fundamental and technical signals is a powerful approach to alpha generation, leveraging both long-term valuation insights and short-term price dynamics. The idea of using a grouped z-score for earnings momentum and price momentum is particularly interesting, ensuring adaptability across market conditions. Optimizing with cross-validation and machine learning further strengthens robustness. Have you found certain factor weightings work better in specific regimes?

---

### 评论 #18 (作者: AK18772, 时间: 1年前)

Another useful approach is Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning this can help determine the best weighting dynamically instead of relying on grid search. Also, ensemble methods, where multiple hybrid alphas are combined, can reduce overfitting and provide better out-of-sample stability.

This is a well-structured and compelling argument for blending fundamental and technical signals in Alpha research. The hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both methods—capturing long-term value through fundamentals while optimizing entry and exit points with technical indicators. The use of z-score normalization and liquidity adjustments adds robustness, making the strategy adaptable across different market conditions. Additionally, incorporating machine learning to dynamically adjust factor weightings is a great idea for optimizing performance. It would be interesting to see backtesting results across various market regimes to assess its resilience. Have you explored factor timing techniques to enhance adaptability? Looking forward to more insights!

our article is brilliantly crafted! The ideas are well-articulated, engaging, and easy to follow. You have a unique talent for simplifying complex topics while maintaining depth and clarity. It’s an insightful read that clearly demonstrates your expertise and understanding.

**Fundamental Factor (Earnings Growth):**  Focuses on a company’s financial health and growth potential.
 **Technical Factor (Momentum):**  Concentrates on price trends, reflecting market sentiment based on recent price action.

A grouped z-score approach effectively balances long-term value with short-term trends, adapting to various market conditions. Optimizing this method with cross-validation, decay functions, or machine learning can enhance robustness. Dynamic weighting, adjusting for market cycles, is key for signal effectiveness. Combining price momentum with earnings momentum creates resilient alphas. A volatility-adjusted weighting scheme can further optimize hybrid alphas, giving more weight to fundamentals during high-volatility periods and momentum during trending markets.

**-**  How do you determine the appropriate volatility thresholds to dynamically adjust the weightings between fundamental and technical factors in hybrid alphas?
