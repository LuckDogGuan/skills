HI PH82915 , I think you should try to make a dataset price and see if it gets a pretty high tunover. I think tunover should be from 40-50% to be suitable for combos too.

Focus on short-term price and volume dynamics, like: ts_delta(close, 1) or ts_delta(volume, 1). Use group_rank(..., country) or group_zscore(..., country) to normalize fast signals and maintain country neutrality (important for global universes).

You should try short term-momentum signals, volatility based-signals and liquidity/volumes spikes, then u will see High turnover alpha made.

Great question! For GLB TOPDIV3000, turnover in the  **40–60% range**  is often effective — it keeps the alpha responsive without overwhelming transaction costs. Try combining  **short-term signals**  like  `ts_delta(price, 1–5)`  or  `ts_rank(volume, 20)`  with  **normalization by country or sector**  using  `group_zscore(...)` . Also, test fast-mean-reversion structures or volatility-adjusted momentum for sharper turnover profiles. Keep an eye on stability metrics while optimizing for speed!

A turnover rate above 40% seems quite risky to me. My main concern is that the margin would be too low after accounting for trading costs, which could be a fatal blow to the Value Factory's performance. For the experienced consultants here, how do you manage to keep a healthy margin with such high-turnover alphas?

Great question, For high-turnover alphas in the GLB TOPDIV3000 universe, a daily turnover between 0.5 to 1.5 is usually a good range. This means your alpha is trading often but still staying stable. High-turnover alphas work well with short-term signals like quick price changes, volume jumps, or market sentiment. But be careful too much trading can lead to high costs and lower profits. So, test your ideas well and check how much trading costs affect performance. Keep your logic simple and clear. With some trial and error, you’ll find what works best. Keep improving and testing!

Try to keep margin as high as your turnover.

Just starting out with GLB TOPDIV3000 high-turnover myself, and I’ve been wondering the same thing as 顾问 JR23144 (Rank 6). If you’re pushing turnover to 50–60%, are there any tips for preserving margin? Do you rely mostly on sharp mean-reversion ideas, or is it more about smart combos?

High-turnover alphas on the GLB TOPDIV3000 universe require a different mindset compared to slower-decaying, low-turnover strategies. Since this universe focuses on top dividend-paying stocks globally, liquidity is generally high, but dividend yield can introduce more stable, slower-moving price components. To make high-turnover ideas work here, you may want to rely on short-horizon signals such as intraday volatility patterns, short-term reversal effects, or rapid sentiment/volume shifts. Operators like  `delta()` ,  `ts_rank()`  over small windows, or event-driven triggers can help generate frequent position changes while still maintaining signal quality. However, excessive turnover without predictive power can erode performance due to transaction cost assumptions in simulation. A typical “high turnover” range in other universes might be 200–400%, but for GLB TOPDIV3000, a more moderate but still active range (e.g., 150–300%) could balance responsiveness and stability. Testing in-sample and OOS is critical to avoid overfitting to short-term noise.

Thanks for raising this topic — high-turnover alpha design is already a nuanced challenge, and tying it to the GLB TOPDIV3000 universe adds even more interesting constraints. Your question is timely because many consultants tend to focus on low- to medium-turnover approaches in dividend-rich universes, often overlooking that short-horizon strategies can still be effective when designed carefully. Asking about preferred turnover ranges is also valuable because it invites others to share empirical results and benchmark ranges they’ve observed in practice. I really appreciate you opening this conversation, as it will likely surface different perspectives on balancing trading frequency, transaction costs, and predictive power in this specific universe.

For the GLB TOPDIV3000 universe, building high-turnover alphas can be effective because the broader coverage allows short-horizon signals like liquidity, order-flow imbalance, intraday volatility, and fast-moving sentiment to express themselves more clearly. When targeting high-turnover, it’s usually better to focus on operators that react quickly to recent price and volume changes (such as decay-based functions or short-window ranks) and pair them with neutralization to avoid excessive sector or country concentration. In terms of range, many contributors have found that  **daily to sub-weekly turnover levels**  are effective for GLB high-turnover themes, but stability still matters—extremely high turnover can increase noise and transaction costs, making OS performance unstable. A practical balance is to design signals that adapt quickly while still producing consistent PnL paths over the OS period.
