Hi Consultant Vietnam,

Normally, I build single alphas with only 2–3 operators.
Because of that, I notice the system automatically puts them into the Power Pool after simulation.

However, I’d like to submit without having them go into the Power Pool. Is there a way to do this?

I’ve tried removing the tag, but after simulation there’s no tag shown, and once submitted, the tag appears — so that’s not feasible.

Currently, I usually have to increase the number of operators, but that makes the Op/Alpha ratio high.

I’d appreciate any advice. Thanks!

Alphas having prod corr>0.7, fitness <1 and not passing 2yr sharpe test <1.58, op count >8, datafields >3, then such alphas are powerpool alphas only. System puts such alphas in powerpool only unless you clear all the above criterias. 
Only thing is if you use single dataset, then these are powerpool+atom alphas and not pure powerpool alphas.

The “Power Pool” tagging is an automated classification mechanism on the platform, so avoiding it entirely isn’t something you can control directly with a single setting. The system evaluates factors like operator count, structural similarity, and performance patterns to determine whether an alpha is classified into Power Pool. Increasing operator count is one workaround, but as you mentioned, it can raise the Op/Alpha ratio unnecessarily. Another approach is to add meaningful transformations or neutralizations that alter the alpha’s profile without simply inflating operator count—e.g., applying sector-neutralization, introducing decay smoothing, or combining orthogonal features from a different dataset. This can shift the alpha’s structure enough to avoid triggering the Power Pool classification while potentially improving robustness. You can also test alternative expressions in a Super Alpha environment to verify if they bypass Power Pool tagging before full submission. However, in many cases, if the signal is inherently simple and fits Power Pool rules, the tag may be unavoidable.

The Power Pool assignment is based on certain structural criteria in your alpha, and operator count is one of them. When your alpha is simple (e.g., only 2–3 operators), the system flags it for Power Pool because such designs are often used for fast benchmarking and diversification. Unfortunately, there is no manual override to completely bypass Power Pool tagging once the alpha meets those rules. Increasing operator count is one workaround, but as you mentioned, it can push up the Op/Alpha ratio, which may not be ideal for efficiency. An alternative is to rethink the design by incorporating small but meaningful transformations — for example, adding a normalization, ranking, or conditional operator that enhances the alpha’s robustness without dramatically increasing complexity. This way, you maintain predictive intent while meeting the system’s criteria for non-Power Pool submission. That said, sometimes letting a high-quality alpha sit in Power Pool can still be beneficial if it performs well in that group.

Hey  [UG81605](/hc/en-us/profiles/5342475745559-UG81605) , I was experiencing the same issue as  [TP19085](/hc/en-us/profiles/7969854259351-TP19085) , but I believe if an alpha passess all the alpha metric thresholds, they will be submittable without power pool issues? For instance, I get the error that the powerpool alpha quota submission for the day is reached.

The Power Pool tagging is  **automatic**  based on alpha structure, operator count, and performance patterns. To avoid it, you can try  **adding meaningful transformations or neutralizations** —like sector-neutralization, decay smoothing, or combining features from different datasets—without simply increasing operator count. This can shift your alpha’s profile enough to bypass Power Pool classification, though for very simple alphas, the tag may still appear.
