Hii,

I need advise in the understanding how operator per alpha and operator used are calculated. As today I have submitted 1st alpha for current quarter using the following 4 operators:

ts_backfill

ts_rank;

trade_when

quantile

But in the tie breaker criteria it shows 7 operator used as shown below

It looks like the discrepancy between the 4 operators you used and the 7 operators shown in the tie-breaker criteria might be due to underlying system dependencies or automatic operators used in the background. Certain operators, like  `ts_rank`  or  `quantile` , might involve additional operations not immediately visible. You may want to check the platform's documentation or reach out to support for a detailed breakdown.

I'm guessing you also had things like +, -, *, /, >, <, >=, <=, etc. in your alpha. These each count as unique operators in your alphas.

[SD99406](/hc/en-us/profiles/21041140594071-SD99406)  Hello! I think you could have used multiple logical operators while using trade_when like those mentioned by  [KS24487](/hc/en-us/profiles/25338264452119-KS24487) .

Oh, that's true @SK72105, I often see the ternary `a ? b : c` operator used in trade_when and I left that one out of my list. It's effectively the same as using if_else(a,b,c).  [顾问 CC40930 (Rank 95)](/hc/en-us/profiles/17789930292503-顾问 CC40930 (Rank 95))  's response is just an AI-generated message, and it's totally incorrect.

Hi SD99406,

The discrepancy between the 4 operators you used and the 7 shown in the tie-breaker likely comes from  **implicit operators** . For instance,  `trade_when`  often involves logical operations like  `>` ,  `<` , or  `if_else`  equivalents. Additionally, some operators like  `ts_rank`  or  `quantile`  may invoke underlying computations that count as separate operators.

This behavior is common and aligns with how the Genius program calculates "operators used." To confirm, you could review your alpha structure for hidden logical or arithmetic operations. Reaching out to platform support for clarification on how the system tracks these would also be helpful!

The increase in the multiplier to 2 times in most regions raises an important question about its impact on base pay. If the multiplier directly affects base pay calculations, it would logically result in doubling the base payment. However, if other factors (like alpha performance or region-specific adjustments) are also considered in the final payout formula, the impact might not be as straightforward.

To get clarity, I recommend checking the latest announcements from the program or contacting support for details on how the new multiplier affects payments. Hopefully, this change brings positive outcomes for all contributors! 🚀

It's essential to closely monitor operators like +, -, *, /, ^, >, <, ==, etc., as they are also counted and can impact the outcome significantly.

Instead of rushing to create a large number of pyramids, prioritize those that are high-value in terms of their potential impact. These pyramids should not only meet geographical constraints but should also provide high diversity, robustness, and predictive power.

Hi,
Does multiple instances of operator like ts_rank or ts_zscore in single alpha would be counted as one or greater than one? Any clarification would be helpful.

---

### 评论 #11 (作者: PP87148, 时间: 1年前)

Hi,

An operator in an alpha will be counted only once regardless the no of times it is used in alpha, means if you use ts_corr 3 times in an alpha, it will be count as 1 operator.

Hope this clarifies your query.

Hey, PP87148

"Thanks for clarifying how operator usage is counted in Alphas! It's good to know that even if an operator like ts_corr is used multiple times, it's only counted as one operator. Helps me optimize my Alphas more effectively!"

Understanding how operator counts are calculated can be tricky sometimes! Keep exploring and experimenting; you'll get the hang of it soon. 😊

The  **quantile operator**  tracks the frequency of its usage within the alpha dataset, offering insights into how often specific thresholds are applied. It segments alpha values into defined groups based on their rank in the distribution. For example, using  `quantile(x, 0.25)`  divides the data into four equal parts, with each group containing 25% of the values. This method is particularly useful for categorizing and analyzing data by separating it into ranked segments.

I find your advice interesting. More specifically, how would you suggest defining a "high-value" pyramid?

I also share the same question as the original poster.
Perhaps Brain should have an article that describes in detail how each tie-break criterion is calculated.
Regarding hidden operators, I believe the inst_pnl() operator is considered as utilizing the pv1 dataset (Price Volume Data for Equity) since it relies on pv1 data for calculations.

I have a question: In super alpha in combo expression and selection expression what are the operators which get counted?

[RB20756](/hc/en-us/profiles/1532012574042-RB20756)  Hello, they would only be  **counted once**  in the operators per alpha calculation. That is, only DISTINCT operators are counted. So lets say your alpha is (df = datafield)

```
add(rank(ts_rank(df,255)),rank(ts_rank(df,22)),rank(ts_zscore(df,66)) 
```

So in this alpha 4 distinct operators are used - i.e. "add","rank","ts_rank", and "ts_zscore"; So, your operator per alpha for this alpha = 4.

[DP14281](/hc/en-us/profiles/25913729314967-DP14281)  Hey! In my observations so far only operators used in the combo expression are counted while the selection expression doesn't cause any increase in operator per alpha metric or the total operator used count. "universe_size", and "in" operators are the only operators unique to selection expression ; however I think they are still not counted

I suspect you might have missed counting some operators. Carefully review your alpha formula and compare it with the operator list to count the operators in your alpha accurately. A more efficient approach would be to develop a script to perform this task automatically. This helps you control the number of operators in your alpha before submission.

What is the significance of convex optimization techniques, such as second-order cone programming (SOCP), in risk parity portfolio construction, and how does it enhance stability compared to traditional quadratic programming?

Hi  [SK72105](/hc/en-us/profiles/8203727051799-SK72105) ,

Thanks for providing light on this, Can anyone confirm with full sureity , which operators are being counted in SuperAlpha Selection Expression, so that we can use the remaining operators.

Since "In", "Universe_Size" and "OWN" these operators are selection specific, they should be counted in selection expression.

I think the arithmetic operator are counted individually due to this the number of operators per alpha increases. Understanding how operator counts are calculated is difficult .

---

### 评论 #24 (作者: ND68030, 时间: 1年前)

The presence of additional operators in the alpha calculation process may stem from factors such as model optimization, risk management, or the combination of different alphas. External factors, such as market conditions and responses to new information, can also increase the number of operators used, thereby affecting the alpha's outcome.

### 评论 #26 (作者: AS16039, 时间: 1年前)

It looks like operators per alpha are counted based on distinct functions used, including implicit logical and arithmetic operators. The Genius program may count hidden operations within functions like  `trade_when`  and  `quantile` . Operators such as  `+` ,  `-` ,  `*` ,  `/` ,  `>` ,  `<` , and ternary conditions can also increase the count. If an operator (e.g.,  `ts_rank` ) is used multiple times, it still counts as one distinct operator. Checking the documentation or reaching out to support for exact tie-breaker calculations would be the best way to clarify discrepancies.

### 评论 #27 (作者: PT27687, 时间: 1年前)

Understanding the nuances of operators can be quite challenging! It would be helpful to clarify how each operator plays a role in your calculations, especially in the tie-breaking situation. Have you checked documentation specific to these operators or consulted with peers who may have insights on their interactions? Your experience with ts_backfill and ts_rank could reveal more interesting patterns, too!

---

### 评论 #28 (作者: RB20756, 时间: 1年前)

The discrepancy between the 4 operators you used and the 7 shown in the tie-breaker likely arises from implicit or background computations. Operators like ts_rank or quantile may involve additional steps, and logical functions within trade_when can add hidden operations. Checking documentation or platform support can clarify the exact operator count methodology.

---

### 评论 #29 (作者: PT27687, 时间: 1年前)

It sounds like you're navigating some complex calculations with operators in your submission. To clarify, could you explain a bit more about the criteria or framework you're working within? Understanding that might help in identifying how the additional operators are being factored into your results. It's an intriguing topic!
