## 帖子正文

I have been trying to come up with good alphas though slight research from the IQC learning. The following are my findings;

1. Try to come up with a marketwise idea

2. Use appropriate Fast Expression Language operators available, not any operator

3. In most times, remember to group neutralize your alpha to avoid bias such as sector biases

4. While simulating your alphas, be sure to have the best combination of the settings, such as decay, universe, truncation etc.

In the end of your research activities, come up with an alpha that has;

i. High Sharpe

ii. High fitness

iii. High returns to drawdown ratio

iv. High margin if possible

v. Low turnover to avoid transaction costs

please what do you mean by appropriate fast expression

The platform uses Fast Expression language operators, like tsbackfill, zscore, grouping operators and others.

Thanks for this detailed explanation. It gives a clear roadmap for anyone trying to develop better alphas step by step.

Thanks for sharing these practical takeaways, MK96099. The reminder to group neutralize alphas is especially important—sector biases can easily creep in and hurt out-of-sample performance.

One question: when you optimize decay, truncation, and other simulation settings, do you have a preferred method for avoiding overfitting to the historical period? I’ve found that small changes in decay can drastically change Sharpe, so I’d be curious how you balance robustness vs. performance.

Great post!
