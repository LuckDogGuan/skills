As its name suggests, "Fields Per Alpha" is a metric that evaluates how many fields you use in a single alpha.

**Example 1:**

> -returns

=> Your alpha uses 1 field (the "returns" field from Pv1).

**Example 2:**

> rank(ts_decay_linear(adv20/ts_sum(volume,120),20))

=> Your alpha uses 2 fields: adv20 and volume.

This means that the fewer fields you use, the more "pure" your alpha is, and it might be more powerful.

#### **Hi TV59277**

**This simply means that how many fields you use in one alpha.**

**Try to use different data fields and minimum data fields in one alpha.**

For optimal performance, you should aim to use fewer than 5 datafields within each alpha criteria. This generally implies that lower datafield counts within each alpha are preferable.

**Fields Per Alpha**  sets the maximum number of input fields that a given alpha model can utilize, thereby influencing how complex or simple a model can be. This restriction helps ensure that the alphas created are robust and generalizable, improving their effectiveness in predicting asset returns.

### 评论 #14 (作者: TL16324, 时间: 1年前)

Fields per alpha is an evaluation tie breaker measuring the number of fields that you used in creating both regular and super alphas. You can understand it through an example like this: Your first alpha submitted uses 3 fields --> Fields per alpha = 3. Then you submit an alpha using 4 datafields --> Fields per alpha now is (3+4)/2 = 3.5, and so on. That is how this tie breaker is calculated.

Everyone realize how important it is to reduce fields per alpha when making alphas, but not many actually know how to improve this tie breaker score. I have recently posted on this topic, you can check it here.

The significance of distributing the quantity of data fields in a single "alpha" (perhaps referring to an experiment, data strategy, or alpha model). In summary:

Diversity in Data Fields: To discover novel insights and investigate wider links, use a variety of data fields.
Minimalism: To minimise complexity, prevent overfitting, and enhance interpretability, a single alpha should include as few fields as possible.
In conclusion, to keep things simple while optimising your alpha, aim for a deliberate selection of necessary but varied data fields.

**Fields Per Alpha (FPA)**  is a metric that reflects the  **diversity and complexity**  of data inputs (fields) utilized during the construction of an alpha. Here's a more detailed explanation:

### **Fields Per Alpha (FPA):**

- **Definition** : It represents the  **average number of unique data fields**  or variables used in the generation of a single alpha. These fields might include price, volume, volatility, fundamentals, sentiment, or other custom dataset features.
- **Purpose** : This metric provides insight into the  **breadth of data utilization**  in alpha creation.

---

### 评论 #18 (作者: AG73209, 时间: 1年前)

### **Optimal Use of FPA** :

- **Balance Complexity** : Strive for an FPA that balances model complexity and predictive power. Avoid unnecessarily inflating FPA, as it might reduce the alpha's uniqueness and increase operational challenges.
- **Improve Diversity** : Analyze the relationship between FPA and alpha uniqueness (reducing correlations among alphas) to foster diversity within the alpha pool.
- **Field Selection** : Carefully select fields that are relevant, complementary, and minimally redundant to improve signal quality.

Ultimately, FPA is a valuable diagnostic tool for optimizing alpha design by ensuring diverse yet efficient field utilization in line with trading objectives.

Fields Per Alpha 其實是一個評估你在單一alpha中使用的field數量的度量。越少的field，會使你的alpha更加「純粹」，也可能使其更強大。根據前面的例子，你可以看到使用不同的data field和盡量減少data field的使用，可以使你的alpha表現更好。而且，有人提到，Fields Per Alpha這個度量可以幫助你構建和優化你的alpha，讓它更有效地預測資產的回報。因此，了解Fields Per Alpha的概念是非常重要的，可以幫助你創建更強大和有效的alpha。

謝謝大家的分享和解釋，現在我對 Fields Per Alpha 的概念有了更深入的了解。根據前面的討論，可以看到 Fields Per Alpha 是一個衡量 alpha 中使用的字段數量的指標，越少的字段可能使 alpha 更加純粹和強大。同時，也有人提到，選擇相關且互補的字段可以提高信號質量，減少冗餘字段的使用可以使 alpha 表現更好。在創建 alpha 時，應該在複雜度和預測力之間找到平衡，避免不必要的字段使用，而是更有效地利用字段來提高 alpha 的效率。感謝大家的幫助和分享，對於我創建更強大和有效的 alpha 有很大的幫助！

"Fields Per Alpha" measures how many data fields are used in an alpha. For example, if your alpha uses only one field, like "returns," it’s simpler. If it uses multiple fields, like "adv20" and "volume," it’s more complex. The fewer fields you use, the more focused and potentially stronger your alpha could be.

he "Fields Per Alpha" parameter defines the maximum number of input fields an alpha model can use, directly influencing the model's complexity and simplicity. By limiting the number of fields, this restriction helps:

1. **Promote Robustness:**  Fewer input fields reduce the risk of overfitting, ensuring the alpha model performs well on out-of-sample data.
2. **Encourage Generalizability:**  A leaner model can adapt more effectively across various market conditions, improving its consistency in predicting asset returns.
3. **Foster Creativity:**  Constraints on field usage encourage participants to find innovative ways to extract meaningful signals using limited inputs.
4. **Maintain Fairness:**  Standardizing the number of fields levels the playing field, allowing comparisons between alphas of similar complexity.

By striking a balance between simplicity and effectiveness, the Fields Per Alpha rule contributes to creating alphas that are not only competitive but also resilient in real-world applications.

"Fields Per Alpha" measures the number of data fields used in an alpha, influencing its complexity and focus. For instance, a single-field alpha, such as one based on "returns," is simpler and more concentrated, while a multi-field alpha leveraging inputs like "adv20" and "volume" introduces complexity. Using fewer fields often results in a more focused and potentially stronger alpha, encouraging robust and efficient signal generation. By carefully selecting fields, you can strike the right balance between simplicity and predictive power, maximizing your alpha's effectiveness.

Optimize your alpha to increase your edge in tie break and the easiest way is to diversify across different datasets to achieve low field perc alpha and do more alpha.

Hi  [TV59277](/hc/en-us/profiles/14331182990615-TV59277) ,

Simply put, " **Fields Per Alpha** " refers to the number of unique data fields used in creating a single alpha. Striking the right balance—using minimal yet effective fields—can enhance the alpha's focus, efficiency, and predictive power.

---

### 评论 #27 (作者: 顾问 LN62753 (Rank 73), 时间: 1年前)

For the "fields per alpha" metric, an effective way to reduce it is by submitting multiple super alphas. Additionally, for regular alphas, you can use datasets with fewer fields while still staying within the same dataset to maintain alpha efficiency.

---

### 评论 #28 (作者: 顾问 CC40930 (Rank 95), 时间: 1年前)

Fields per alpha represent the number of unique fields or data inputs used to construct an alpha. A lower number typically means the alpha is simpler and less likely to overfit, while a higher number might capture more complex relationships but could also lead to overfitting. Hope this helps clarify things! 😊

### 评论 #29 (作者: NT63388, 时间: 1年前)

I also notice two points to pay attention to regarding Fields Per Alpha (FPA):

1. Fields will not account for duplication.
For example,  *ts_delay(returns,5)-returns*  is considered as just one field.
This point can help adjust the strategy for generating Alphas with fewer FPAs.

2. If the inst_pnl operator is used, it will automatically count one field of Pv1.

"Fields Per Alpha" refers to the number of data fields included in an alpha model, affecting its complexity and focus. For example, a simple alpha based on a single field like "returns" is more concentrated, while a more complex alpha that uses multiple fields such as "adv20" and "volume" increases its complexity. A smaller number of fields often leads to a more focused and potentially stronger alpha, facilitating more reliable and efficient signal generation. By carefully selecting the right fields, you can find the optimal balance between simplicity and predictive strength, enhancing the performance of your alpha. 💡📊

You should use less number of datafields to reduce the value of Fields per alpha, Below 5 it is good and you should also use less explored fields to increase the number of total fields used.

Hi,
Fields per alpha are the number of data fields used to create an alpha. Fewer fields make it simpler and less likely to overfit, while more fields can capture more details but might overfit.

### 评论 #36 (作者: AB15407, 时间: 1年前)

Fields per Alpha (FPA) is an important and difficult criterion to achieve.
For skilled consultants, they can reach an average FPA threshold of 2–5, but in return, the "Fields used" criterion will not be high.
I believe FPA should have a higher weighting due to its level of difficulty.

### 评论 #37 (作者: PT82759, 时间: 1年前)

"Fields per Alpha" (FPA) simply measures the number of data fields used in an alpha. A lower number means your alpha is simpler and potentially more robust, avoiding overfitting. For example, if your alpha uses "returns," it's one field. If it uses "adv20" and "volume," it's two fields. The goal is to balance simplicity with predictive power—use as few fields as possible while still capturing the necessary signals.
