High turnover is one of the most common "alpha killers" on Brain. You might find a signal with a brilliant Sharpe ratio, only to watch it fail out-of-sample because it demands buying and selling the entire portfolio every two days.

To tame erratic signals and reduce transaction costs, you need to apply  **time-series smoothing** . Here are the most effective operators and techniques to bring your turnover down to acceptable levels:

- **Use Decay Operators:**  Apply  *`ts_decay_linear`*  or  *`ts_decay_exp`*  to smooth out daily spikes. These are the most effective tools, as they keep recent data relevant while dampening volatility.
- **Apply Moving Averages:**  Use *`ts_mean`* for steady, equal-weighted smoothing, or  *`ts_median`*  to ignore single-day extreme outliers.
- **Add a Delay:**  Use  *`delay(x, 1)`* to deliberately slow down fast-moving signals and desensitize them to intraday noise.
- **Optimize Structure:**  Smooth your signals  *after*  ranking them (e.g.,  *`ts_decay_linear(rank(x), 5)` )* , or group your raw signals into discrete buckets (like deciles) so the portfolio only trades on meaningful, larger moves.
- Ultimately, time-series smoothing prevents your algorithm from overreacting to daily market noise and getting eaten alive by transaction costs.

i had an issue with an issue in creating my alphas that they had high turnover above 70%,but this post indeed it has helped me navigate. I'm somewhere now atleast.

thank you for this post
