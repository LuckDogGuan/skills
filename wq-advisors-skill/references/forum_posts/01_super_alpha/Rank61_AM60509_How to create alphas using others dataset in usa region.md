**Market Data** : Stock prices, volumes, P/E ratios, earnings reports, and other financial data specific to companies in Europe. You can find these from sources like Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, or local exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange (LSE), Euronext, etc.

Hi [顾问 AM60509 (Rank 61)](/hc/en-us/profiles/25127049757975-顾问 AM60509 (Rank 61)) ,
Creating alphas with other datasets in regions like the USA can be easier compared to Europe. However, try to select high-coverage data from these datasets. Experiment with different neutralization settings to see what works best. Also, apply various operators and explore different ones to improve your results.

Take time to analyze what’s holding you back at the Gold level. Is it a specific area where you’re underperforming (e.g., risk management, selecting alphas, etc.)? Identifying and addressing these gaps can help you move forward.

Filter  **USA region**  datasets in  **Data Explorer**  and pick underutilized ones. Analyze  **type, nature, and coverage** , then transform with  `zscore` ,  `diff` , or  `group_rank` . Backtest, refine with time-series ops, and optimize execution.

there are lot of good datasets in usa region use api and  find best working data using it. you will easily get the more 10 good signals in other dataset. make sure coverage using the ts_backfill.

That's all I can suggest....

Happy Learning!!!

Instead of practicing without a goal in mind, practice strategically. Identify areas where you are weak, and concentrate your effort on improving those areas. Whether it’s studying past Grand Master strategies or refining a particular skill, focused practice tends to yield better results.

To create  **alphas using alternative datasets**  in the  **USA region** , follow these steps:

1. **Data Selection** : Use high-coverage datasets like earnings reports, sentiment data, and options flow.
2. **Feature Engineering** : Apply  `zscore()` ,  `diff()` , and  `group_rank()`  for transformation.
3. **Alpha Generation** : Use  `ts_rank()` ,  `ts_zscore()` , and  `neutralize()`  for robustness.
4. **Backtesting & Optimization** : Validate out-of-sample, apply  `adv_ratio()`  for execution efficiency.

**Diversification** : Allocating across various asset classes (e.g., equities, bonds, commodities) in the EUR zone can help improve performance by reducing unsystematic risk.

To create alphas using other datasets in the USA region:

1. **Select Diverse Data:**  Use earnings reports, sentiment data, options flow, or insider trading from  *Data Explorer* .
2. **Feature Engineering:**  Apply  `zscore()` ,  `diff()` , and  `group_rank()`  to transform data and use  `group_neutralize()`  to reduce biases.
3. **Generate Signals:**  Combine features with  `ts_rank()` ,  `ts_zscore()` , and use  `combo_a()`  for blending multiple signals.
4. **Backtest & Optimize:**  Validate using  `ts_backfill()` , monitor Sharpe ratio, turnover, and correlation.
5. **Diversify:**  Mix different strategies to reduce correlation and improve performance

Hi  [顾问 AM60509 (Rank 61)](/hc/en-us/profiles/25127049757975-顾问 AM60509 (Rank 61)) ,
In response to your question, I believe you're asking how to incorporate other dataset categories. There’s a strong relationship between traditional alpha signals and AI/ML-enhanced datasets, which can be leveraged to improve neutralization. Using these datasets effectively can help refine alphas by reducing unwanted biases and making them more robust across different market conditions

Use  `zscore` ,  `ts_mean` , or  `group_rank`  on  `other176`  in the USA region. Combine with  `historical_volatility_180`  or  `mdl135_vlc`  for better Sharpe. Normalize using  `group_zscore(country)` .

Hi  [顾问 AM60509 (Rank 61)](/hc/en-us/profiles/25127049757975-顾问 AM60509 (Rank 61)) !

Great to see you exploring the Others dataset category! Some steps to get you started:

**1) Choose a dataset:** USA region typically has the challenge of overcoming production correlation. You can choose a dataset based on how many alphas have already been found in that dataset (e.g. the lower the number of alphas, the less utilized the dataset, the higher the likelihood of overcoming production correlation), how well you understand the dataset, and perhaps how good the data is (e.g. high coverage).

**2) Start simulating:** You can start simulating the data fields in the chosen dataset using simple operators first (e.g. cross-sectional and time series). This could work well with model and fundamental datasets in the Others category. For other types of datasets in the Others category, you may need to create ratios or do other manipulation to the raw data to form potential signals.

**3) Improve your alphas:**  For expressions that display some level of potential (e.g. good sharpe), you can work on improving them further by adding other operators to resolve issues such as missing data, outliers, and currency differences.

Creating alphas in the USA using alternative datasets offers several advantages, as data availability and coverage tend to be higher. Here’s a structured approach to enhance alpha generation:

1. **Dataset Selection** : Use  **Data Explorer**  to filter and identify underutilized datasets with high coverage. Consider  **fundamental, alternative (e.g., credit card transactions, satellite imagery), and sentiment-based data** .
2. **Feature Transformation** : Apply techniques like  **z-score normalization, differencing (diff), or group ranking**  to refine raw data into meaningful signals.
3. **Neutralization & Optimization** : Experiment with  **different neutralization settings** , incorporating  **time-series operations**  to improve robustness across varying market conditions.
4. **Backtesting & Execution** : Run rigorous  **backtests** , adjust  **execution strategies** , and ensure  **low correlation**  with existing alphas to maintain uniqueness and effectiveness.

By systematically integrating these steps, you can develop  **high-performing, well-optimized alphas**  for the USA market.

Creating alphas with external datasets in regions like the USA can sometimes be more straightforward than in Europe, as there is often more data availability and liquidity. However, to enhance performance, it's essential to select high-coverage datasets that capture diverse market signals. By experimenting with different neutralization settings and applying various operators, you can refine your alphas and uncover valuable insights.

When you're at the Gold level, take time to analyze where you're underperforming. It could be an area such as risk management, alpha selection, or testing. Identifying the gap is the first step toward overcoming it. Addressing these weak points allows for continuous improvement and can help you advance further.

Have you considered combining alternative datasets (like sentiment or macroeconomic data) with traditional factors to create more robust alphas?
