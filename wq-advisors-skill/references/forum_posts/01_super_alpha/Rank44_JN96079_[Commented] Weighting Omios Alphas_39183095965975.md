## 帖子正文

Hello everyone,

I would like to ask for your advice on how to assign weights to Omios alphas. Currently, I mainly allocate weights to alphas with high OS Sharpe ratios, but some alphas that have been submitted recently do not yet have OS results available.

So, should I assign weights to those alphas? If I do include alphas without OS data, would there be any differences compared to the others?

Thank you everyone.

It is generally risky to assign equal weight to an alpha with only In-Sample (IS) data compared to one with a proven OS track record. IS metrics are often over-optimistic due to the natural tendency to overfit during the research phase. A common practice is to apply a "haircut" to new submissions-for example, assigning them only 10% or 20% of the weight you would give a proven OS alpha. This allows them to contribute marginally while they prove their robustness. How heavily do you typically rely on IS Sharpe when initially sizing a brand new signal?

**On whether to assign weights to alphas without OS data:**

The honest answer is yes, but with conservative sizing relative to your alphas that have established OS track records. Completely ignoring new submissions until OS data accumulates means you're systematically underweighting your most recent and potentially most relevant research — which is a real opportunity cost especially if your newer alphas are built on improved methodology compared to older ones.

**How to think about weighting without OS data:**

For alphas without OS history, you're essentially making a prior probability judgment about quality based on available information. The IS metrics, robustness checks you ran before submission, the economic soundness of the hypothesis, and whether the signal passed your personal pre-submission checklist — these become your quality proxies in the absence of OS confirmation.

A practical tiering approach that works well: assign your full target weight to alphas with strong confirmed OS performance, assign 40-50% of target weight to new alphas with strong IS metrics and solid robustness characteristics, and assign minimal or zero weight to new alphas where IS metrics were borderline or robustness checks were inconclusive. As OS data accumulates over the following weeks, adjust weights based on whether live behavior is confirming or contradicting your IS expectations.

Building on the idea of conservative sizing, I’d add that you shouldn't treat all new alphas equally. If a new IS-only alpha is highly correlated to your proven OS alphas, it’s safer to leave its weight at zero for now. However, if the new alpha utilizes a completely orthogonal dataset or a fundamentally different concept, it immediately deserves a small allocation simply for the diversification benefit it brings to the pool. Do you run a strict cross-sectional correlation check against your active book before deciding to weight a new alpha?

To KP26017's point about opportunity cost, the market regime is always shifting. A hidden risk of relying solely on historical OS Sharpe is that older alphas might be actively decaying, while your brand-new submissions are perfectly tuned to current market dynamics. I like to slowly scale up the weights of new, uncorrelated alphas while simultaneously scaling down older signals that are showing signs of recent OS fatigue. Have you noticed if your newer methodologies tend to perform better in the current market environment than your older established ones?

Hi BH48458, that's a great question about balancing OS Sharpe with incorporating newer alphas. It's definitely a common challenge. Have you considered a hybrid approach, perhaps assigning a smaller, more conservative weight to alphas with no OS data, and then re-evaluating their weights as OS results become available? This could allow you to capture potential upside while mitigating early-stage risk.

Give weight mainly to alphas with strong OS Sharpe—that’s your most reliable signal.

For newly submitted alphas without OS:

- Include them, but assign  **small exploratory weights**  .
- Prioritize those with strong IS robustness (ladder Sharpe, low turnover, stability).
- Scale them up only after OS confirms performance.

Hi BH48458, that's a common dilemma in alpha weighting. It's a great question about balancing potential with proven performance. I'd be interested to hear if others have experimented with assigning a small, preliminary weight to promising new alphas before OS data is fully available, perhaps with a cap until they demonstrate stability.

Hi BH48458, that's a great question about weighting Omios alphas. It's common to rely on OS Sharpe for initial weighting, but for new alphas without that data, you might consider their predictive power based on backtesting metrics beyond just Sharpe, like information coefficient or turnover profiles, as a proxy for potential OS performance. Have you experimented with any alternative weighting schemes for these nascent alphas, perhaps based on feature importance or correlation with market factors?

### 评论 #10 (作者: DT49505, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great question that many of us grapple with! While prioritizing alphas with strong OS Sharpe is a sensible starting point, for new alphas without OS data, I'd suggest a cautious approach. Perhaps consider a small, initial weight and monitor their performance closely, potentially adjusting as OS data becomes available. Have you experimented with any proxies for alpha quality in the absence of OS data, like backtest statistics or correlation to existing strong alphas?

### 评论 #11 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a common dilemma! While relying on OS Sharpe is a solid baseline, it's risky to completely ignore promising new alphas lacking that data. Perhaps consider a small, cautious allocation to those, weighted by factors like recent backtest performance or developer conviction, and monitor their OS results closely. Have you found any correlation between early backtest metrics and subsequent OS Sharpe that might inform this initial weighting?

I am also looking for this .I also want to know

What should be ideal ratio of super alphas and regular alphas to maximize the osmosis performance.

That’s a thoughtful question about assigning weights to Omios alphas. While out-of-sample Sharpe is often used as a primary guide for newer alphas without a track record, it can be helpful to consider other indicators of predictive strength. Metrics such as the information coefficient, turnover characteristics, or overall backtest stability can serve as useful proxies for estimating potential out-of-sample performance.

Great question, BH48458! It's a common challenge to balance established alphas with promising new ones. Have you considered incorporating a "potential" or "discovery" weight for alphas without OS data, perhaps based on factors like concept novelty or backtest performance, which then scales up as OS data becomes available? This could allow you to capture early upside while still prioritizing robust, tested strategies.

### 评论 #15 (作者: NS62681, 时间: 3个月前)

Hi BH48458, that's a common challenge when incorporating new alphas. It's wise to be cautious about weighting alphas without OS results, as their true performance and stability are yet to be validated. Perhaps a small, introductory weight could be considered for those newer alphas, with the understanding that this weight would be subject to significant adjustment (or even removal) based on incoming OS data and their observed correlation with your existing portfolio. What are your thoughts on a potential initial weighting strategy for these unproven alphas, perhaps a small fraction of the total allocation?

---

### 评论 #16 (作者: TL72720, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great point, BH48458. Relying solely on OS Sharpe for weighting can indeed be tricky with newer alphas. Have you considered incorporating other metrics like theoretical R-squared, factor exposure stability, or even just a small, equal-weighted allocation to new alphas as a starting point for initial observation before OS data becomes available? It's a trade-off between optimizing for current data and allowing promising new ideas a chance to prove themselves.

### 评论 #17 (作者: HN97575, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great question, BH48458! It's a common dilemma when trying to incorporate new alphas. While relying on OS Sharpe is a solid starting point, you might consider a hybrid approach: assign small, initial weights to new alphas with strong theoretical underpinnings or compelling backtest metrics, while giving larger weights to those with established OS performance. This allows you to capture potential upside from promising new ideas without overexposing your portfolio to unknowns. Have you experimented with any qualitative factors or look-ahead metrics to help filter these new alphas before they have OS data?

---

### 评论 #18 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a classic dilemma when dealing with new alphas! It's understandable to lean on OS Sharpe as a primary metric, but for nascent alphas, I'd recommend a blended approach. Consider incorporating other available metrics like in-sample performance, Sharpe ratio improvements over a rolling window, or even the theoretical soundness of the alpha's premise. Perhaps a small, exploratory weighting for alphas without OS data could be justified, with the understanding that their allocation will be significantly adjusted as OS results become available.

### 评论 #19 (作者: ND24253, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, BH48458! It's a common dilemma when onboarding new alphas. While high OS Sharpe is a strong indicator, I'd caution against solely relying on it for new alphas, especially those without OS results yet. Perhaps a small, exploratory allocation to promising new alphas, based on their in-sample performance and fundamental logic, could be a way to gather initial out-of-sample data without excessive risk. Have you considered any alternative metrics or qualitative factors to assess alphas that haven't accumulated OS history?

### 评论 #20 (作者: BM18934, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, BH48458! It's a common challenge balancing established alphas with promising new ones lacking OS data. I've found that a diversified approach, perhaps assigning a small initial weight to new alphas based on their backtest performance and intuition, can be a good strategy, but it's crucial to monitor their out-of-sample performance closely once it becomes available to avoid over-allocating to unproven ideas. What factors, besides OS Sharpe, do you consider when evaluating alphas for potential weighting in your current allocation?

---

### 评论 #21 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

Hi BH48458, this is a classic dilemma! It's understandable to lean on OS Sharpe, but for newer alphas lacking that history, consider a more conservative, equal-weighting approach initially. Perhaps a short-term validation period with limited capital could provide the data needed to build confidence before increasing allocation, while also helping to isolate any unexpected behavior of these unseasoned alphas.

---

### 评论 #22 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a crucial question for building robust portfolios! While OS Sharpe is a strong indicator, consider incorporating other signals for nascent alphas. Perhaps a blended approach, giving a small initial weight to newer alphas based on their fundamental logic and individual factor characteristics, could mitigate risk while still allowing them to prove their worth. What metrics are you using to assess the *fundamental logic* or *individual factor characteristics* of these new alphas before OS data is available?

---

### 评论 #23 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, BH48458! It's a common dilemma navigating the trade-off between OS Sharpe and introducing novel alphas. My general approach is to cautiously allocate a small, "exploration" weight to new alphas without OS data, perhaps by sector or correlation, to gauge their live behavior without significantly impacting portfolio risk. This allows for early detection of potential issues or early wins. Have you considered any methods for estimating potential OS Sharpe before full deployment, or perhaps using shorter lookback periods for initial weighting?

### 评论 #24 (作者: NN29533, 时间: 3个月前)

Hi BH48458, that's a crucial question in alpha construction! While it's tempting to solely rely on OS Sharpe for weighting, consider a hybrid approach. Perhaps assigning small, exploratory weights to newer alphas based on their in-sample performance or theoretical soundness could be beneficial, with the understanding that these weights would be adjusted rapidly as OS data becomes available. Have you experimented with any metrics beyond Sharpe ratio to gauge a new alpha's potential before OS results?

---

### 评论 #25 (作者: NM98411, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great question about balancing established performance with the potential of new Omios alphas! While OS Sharpe is a strong indicator, it's worth considering if there are other metrics or qualitative aspects of newer alphas (e.g., sector focus, data sources used, simplicity of logic) that might justify an initial allocation, even without OS results. Have you experimented with a small "exploration" allocation for promising new alphas to gather early data, or do you find it's generally better to wait for OS validation?

---

### 评论 #26 (作者: HT71201, 时间: 3个月前)

While out-of-sample Sharpe is a common starting point for newer signals, it’s useful to look at additional indicators of predictive strength. Metrics like information coefficient, turnover, and backtest stability can provide better insight into expected out-of-sample performance.

### 评论 #27 (作者: BM18934, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, BH48458! It's a common dilemma. While OS Sharpe is a strong signal, consider a diversified approach. Perhaps a smaller, more exploratory allocation to newer alphas with a hypothesis-driven rationale (even without OS data) could be beneficial for uncovering hidden gems. Have you experimented with any qualitative factors or domain expertise when evaluating these nascent alphas?

---

### 评论 #28 (作者: DT49505, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, BH48458! It's a common dilemma. While OS Sharpe is a strong indicator, I've found that considering factors like alpha correlation and signal duration can offer a more robust weighting scheme, especially for newer alphas. For those without OS data, have you considered assigning a small, uniform weight initially and then adjusting it as OS results become available, perhaps using a Bayesian approach to incorporate prior beliefs?

---

### 评论 #29 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, BH48458! It's a common challenge balancing established alpha performance with the potential of new ideas. You're right to prioritize OS Sharpe, but I'd suggest considering other factors for nascent alphas, like the strength of the underlying economic intuition or the diversity of the signal's universe. Perhaps a small, experimental weighting could be applied, with a strict review trigger tied to their initial OS performance to avoid significant drawdowns.
