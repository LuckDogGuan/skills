Hi  [JK98819](/hc/en-us/profiles/4935450091415-JK98819) ,

Building alphas in Europe (EUR) is more challenging than in other regions due to its multi-country landscape. To succeed, you’ll need to adjust your approach and fine-tune several factors. Here are some key strategies:

- **Optimize Dataset Usage** : Focus on highly utilized datasets to pinpoint strong signals, but be mindful of keeping the number of fields per alpha minimal.
- **Implement Custom Neutralizations** : Standard neutralizations might not always work well in EUR because of regional variations. Experiment with custom techniques to enhance your signals.
- **Fine-Tune Decay & Truncation** : The selection of decay and truncation settings is crucial for alpha performance in the EUR region. Test different configurations to find the best ones.
- **Backfill Data for Better Signals** : Ensure you backfill data correctly to improve signal quality and capture key historical patterns that might otherwise be missed

You can try these approaches to improve alpha in EUR:

- **Focus on liquidity and volatility**  – The European market differs from the US and Asia, so try focusing on  *volume*  to see if it helps.
- **Use macroeconomic data**  – Europe is heavily influenced by PMI, ECB interest rates, unemployment, etc. These factors might improve alpha performance.
- **Optimize operators**  – Some operators like  *Decay* ,  *TS_Rank* , and  *TS_Correlation*  may work better. Avoid using too many complex operators.

Quantitative trading strategies for the EUR region, with a focus on developing alpha signals using time-series operators and neutralization techniques.

Your approach of leveraging  **ts_mean, ts_rank, and group_neutralize**  with longer lookback periods (20-60 days) makes sense, especially given the lower liquidity in some European markets. This helps smooth out noise and capture more persistent signals.

A few points to refine and optimize the approach:

1. **Trend & Momentum Signals**
   - **ts_decay_linear**  is excellent for capturing smoothed momentum effects, but consider using it in conjunction with  **z-scored returns**  to avoid overweighting extreme movements.
   - You could also test  **ts_winsorize**  to eliminate outliers before applying momentum-based transformations.
2. **Correlation-Based Signals**
   - **ts_corr(price, volume, 20-60)**  helps understand demand shifts. If price and volume move together strongly, it can indicate accumulation/distribution patterns.
   - Consider cross-asset correlations (e.g.,  **ts_corr(stock, index, 30)** ) to measure relative strength within sectors.
3. **Neutralization & Residualization**
   - **group_neutralize(signal, country)**  ensures that country-level macro effects don’t distort stock-level insights.
   - If focusing on industry-wide effects, also try  **group_neutralize(signal, sector)** .
   - To adjust for market-wide risk exposure,  **beta-neutralize(signal, market_returns)**  can help.
4. **Liquidity & Market Microstructure Adjustments**
   - Use  **ts_rank(volume, 60)**  to filter out illiquid stocks that could distort signals.
   - Leverage  **volatility-adjusted signals**  (e.g.,  **returns/ts_stddev(returns, 30)** ) to ensure stability.

According to my personal experience, I suggest trying model, risk, and fundamental datasets with a lower decay. To cover multiple pyramids, try identifying some booster alphas from these datasets. When you add those booster alphas to low-signal datasets like analysts or earnings, they will enhance the signal and meet the given criteria.
Thank you,

Hi,
Building alphas in Europe (EUR) is harder because it has many countries. To do well, try these simple strategies: First, use important datasets with fewer fields to find strong signals. Standard methods might not work in EUR, so create custom approaches for better results. Adjust the decay and truncation settings carefully, as they affect alpha performance. Test different options to see which works best. Finally, make sure to backfill data properly to capture important past trends and improve your signals. I suggest you to create alpha using model, fundamental and analyst dataset.

Unlike the U.S., where a single currency dominates, European markets are heavily influenced by currency fluctuations and interest rate differentials across the region. If you are not already incorporating FX-adjusted returns or ECB policy signals, doing so could significantly enhance alpha robustness. Try adding ts_corr(stock_returns, EUR/USD, 30) or neutralizing against interest rate shocks using macroeconomic datasets.

Hi JK98819,
Building alphas for the European market can be tricky, but you might improve performance by integrating macroeconomic signals and liquidity factors. Here are some key approaches to consider:

- **Cross-market correlations** : Use ts_corr between stocks and major economic indices like DAX, FTSE, or Stoxx 600 to capture regional trends.
- **FX-adjusted signals** : Since Europe has multiple currencies, incorporating ts_corr(stock_returns, EUR/USD, 30) can help reduce currency fluctuation noise.
- **Sector-specific decay tuning** : Some European sectors are more stable than their US counterparts, so lower decay values might work better in specific cases.
- **Flexible neutralization techniques** : Instead of only neutralizing by country, try group_neutralize based on broader regions (Nordic, Western Europe, Eastern Europe) to get a clearer market-wide perspective.

Hope these insights help in optimizing your alpha strategies for the EUR region!
