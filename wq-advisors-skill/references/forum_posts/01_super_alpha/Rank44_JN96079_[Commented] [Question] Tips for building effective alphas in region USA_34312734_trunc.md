Hi everyone, I’ve been working on alphas for the USA region recently, but I’ve noticed that performance isn’t very stable especially when I turn on the investability constraint, the Sharpe ratio drops quite a lot. Do you have any tips or strategies to keep performance more stable?

Hi there, when working on USA region alphas, especially under investability constraints, one key challenge is the impact of liquidity and turnover restrictions. Many signals that look strong in raw simulations lose stability once you account for tradability. A practical approach is to focus on signals that naturally align with more liquid universes—such as factors derived from larger-cap names or relative strength measures within liquid peer groups. Another useful strategy is to test robustness by applying quantile-based ranking instead of raw values, which helps smooth out sensitivity to extremes. You might also consider blending complementary signals (e.g., value + momentum) to reduce dependency on one style, which often improves Sharpe stability. Lastly, don’t underestimate the role of longer holding horizons: sometimes lengthening the rebalance period helps reduce turnover and mitigates the performance hit when constraints are active.

You could try focusing on datasets where a significant number of strong alphas have historically been built, such as  **Price-Volume** ,  **Fundamental** , or  **Model-based datasets** . These datasets tend to provide more reliable signals and are generally easier to work with when constructing alphas.

By using these, you’ll likely find it easier to maintain good performance  **even after applying investability constraints** , as these datasets are widely tested and have proven robustness under real-world conditions. Once you have a stable base, you can then experiment with more niche datasets for diversification.

recently i have also facing some difficulties in USA region ,but you trying to use  **Price-Volume** ,  **Fundamental** , and  **Model-based datasets** . These datasets are well-tested, robust under real-world conditions, and easier to work with compared to niche datasets. Once a stable base is established, niche datasets can be explored to diversify and enhance overall performance. thanks

Great question! 🇺🇸 When building alphas in the USA region, stability often depends on balancing innovation with robustness. A few tips: (1) Pay attention to sector and liquidity biases, since investability constraints can weaken raw signals. (2) Focus on low-correlation features, as highly overlapping ideas tend to wash out under constraints. (3) Use normalization or purify-type operators to reduce noise and improve signal consistency. (4) Patience—USA alphas usually need longer horizons to prove stability compared to smaller regions.

From my point of view, USA alphas might look unstable, but as long as your signal is market sensible and has a good perspective, then try to make the metrics at least meet the eligibility for submission, I'm sure if it is submittable, then US signals are strong. That is why the platform values US signals compared to others. So, make sure your signals pass the required thresholds, and it's all good!

Interesting point—investability constraints often impact stability. I’d also like to learn tips on handling this trade-off. Thanks for raising this valuable question!

看到大佬提到在USA区域构建alpha时，开启investability约束后Sharpe ratio下降明显，这个问题确实很常见。在WorldQuant Brain平台上回测时，我也遇到过类似情况。investability约束会限制可投资标的范围，可能过滤掉一些高收益但流动性较差的股票，导致策略收益分布发生变化。建议可以尝试调整约束的严格程度，或者结合其他风险控制手段来平衡收益与稳定性。另外，可以考虑在因子构建阶段就融入流动性指标，比如结合volume、turnover等算子，这样可能有助于提升策略在约束条件下的表现。不过这些都只是基于回测的经验，具体效果还需要进一步验证。
