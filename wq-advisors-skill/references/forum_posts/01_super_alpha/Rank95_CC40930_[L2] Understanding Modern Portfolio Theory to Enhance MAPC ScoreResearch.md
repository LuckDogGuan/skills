**Introduction:**  In MAPC, all Alphas submitted by you are combined together in an equal weighted fashion to created a merged performance series. The PnL Chart of this series is then used to calculate metrics like Sharpe, Returns/Drawdown ratio and turnover. The detailed Scoring of MAPC 2024 is provided here:  [https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/articles/11924784817047-What-is-the-scoring-criteria-for-MAPC](/hc/en-us/articles/11924784817047-What-is-the-scoring-criteria-for-MAPC)

This article explores how Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) can provide insights into understanding MAPC scoring and suggests ways to improve the Merged Performance Score.

**Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and MAPC** : Modern Portfolio Theory offers a mathematical framework for constructing portfolios that aim to maximize expected returns while considering the associated risk. It suggests that by combining assets with different risk and return profiles, an optimal portfolio can be constructed to achieve a desired level of risk. In MAPC, the portfolio consists of multiple Alphas submitted by you, each with its unique risk and return characteristics. By combining these Alphas in an equal-weighted fashion, you generate a merged performance series with an expected return and expected risk profile.

**Expected Return Calculation:**  The expected return of the merged Alpha portfolio in MAPC can be mathematically expressed as the weighted average of the expected returns of individual Alphas.

Since all Alphas are equally weighted, the weight for each Alpha is 1/n, where n is the number of Alphas submitted.

**Variance Calculation and Risk Reduction** : The variance of the merged portfolio determines its overall risk. The variance of the same merged portfolio (let’s say with 2 assets) can be calculated as follows:

Generalizing for N assets, the variance calculation becomes:

Note that from the formula for variance calculation, by incorporating Alphas with lower or negative correlations, the merged portfolio's risk can be reduced. This is because non-synchronous movements among Alphas can offset each other's risks, resulting in a smoother return profile. Hence, submitting Alphas with low correlation improves the Merged Performance Score.

**Why do you get a negative expected score if you submit correlated Alphas in MAPC?**

Submitting highly correlated Alphas increases the susceptibility of the merged portfolio to higher overall risk. This leads to a decrease in the Sharpe ratio of the Merged Portfolio (Returns/Standard deviation of returns), which explains the negative expected score. To avoid this, it’s advisable to submit Alphas with low correlation.

**Besides lowering correlation, can anything else help improve Merged Performance Score?**

The Merged Performance Score is directly proportional to Returns/Drawdown Ratio. Major drawdowns in the merged performance series may arise from factor-specific risks. Eg – Crowding Risk. Neutralizing Alphas to crowding risk factors such as hedge fund ownership, short interest, and momentum factors can help mitigate these risks. Data Explorer can be utilized to identify such risk factors and neutralize Alphas to these risks effectively. Additionally, neutralizing Alphas to well-documented risk factors like size, volatility also aids in diversification. Besides this, lowering Alpha turnover using operators that help maintain or improve Alpha signal can be helpful. Eg – Using ts_decay_exp_window instead of linear decay can be a useful tool! Instead of increasing decay to reduce turnover, Alpha signal can be refined much better by using various operators. Do you use any such operators in your Alpha Expression, feel free to post them in the comments!

**Conclusion:**  In the above article, you understood that by submitting Alphas with low correlation, you may enhance your Merged Performance Score in MAPC. Besides neutralizing to risk factors may also be helpful for diversification.

Do you have any other questions or observations from your experience while submitting Alphas in MAPC? Feel free to ask/share in the comments!

This is an insightful analysis of how Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and portfolio diversification strategies can enhance the Merged Performance Score in MAPC. 🤔

The core idea of reducing risk through low correlations between Alphas is crucial—by diversifying the risks, the portfolio becomes less susceptible to sharp drawdowns. As you mentioned, factors like crowding risk can heavily impact performance, so neutralizing Alphas to avoid such risks could definitely improve the overall score.

I also appreciate the mention of turnover optimization. Using operators like  `ts_decay_exp_window`  to adjust the decay function helps to manage turnover without compromising Alpha signal strength. This is an important strategy to fine-tune the balance between signal reliability and trading activity.

On a practical note, I’ve found that incorporating factors like momentum and volatility in neutralizing strategies can yield more stable returns. By reducing high turnover while still maintaining a sharp signal through targeted decay, you can achieve more consistent results over time.

Looking forward to more discussions on techniques for improving the Merged Performance Score!

**Risk (Volatility)** : The risk profile of the merged performance series is influenced by the individual risks of each Alpha, but more importantly, by the correlation between the Alphas. If the Alphas are highly correlated, combining them may not reduce risk significantly. However, if they are less correlated or uncorrelated, the overall portfolio risk can be reduced, leading to a more favorable risk-adjusted return.

Use the scoring metrics like Sharpe, Returns/Drawdown ratio, and turnover as tools to fine-tune your submissions. If your merged performance series has a low Sharpe ratio or a high drawdown, consider rebalancing the Alphas in your portfolio, potentially replacing those that are underperforming or too volatile.

### **nderstanding Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to Enhance MAPC Score**

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is a widely-used framework for constructing investment portfolios in a way that optimizes expected return relative to risk. MPT emphasizes the importance of diversification, stating that a well-balanced portfolio can reduce risk without sacrificing returns. By understanding and applying MPT, investors can maximize their  **MAPC (Maximum Active Portfolio Contribution)**  score.

#### **Key Concepts of MPT:**

1. **Risk and Return:**
   - MPT suggests that the expected return of a portfolio should be maximized for a given level of risk. Risk is measured using the standard deviation of the portfolio’s returns, and return is measured by the average expected returns of the assets in the portfolio.
2. **Diversification:**
   - Diversification is a fundamental principle of MPT. The theory holds that by holding a diverse range of assets, investors can reduce the overall risk of the portfolio. By combining assets that are not perfectly correlated, the volatility of the portfolio is less than the sum of individual asset volatilities.
3. **Efficient Frontier:**
   - The Efficient Frontier is a curve representing the set of portfolios that offer the highest expected return for each level of risk. Portfolios that lie on the Efficient Frontier are considered optimal portfolios.
4. **Covariance and Correlation:**
   - MPT uses the covariance between asset returns to determine how assets move in relation to each other. Low or negative correlation between assets can be used to reduce overall portfolio risk.
5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - MPT involves selecting the right mix of asset classes (equities, bonds, commodities, etc.) to achieve the desired risk-return tradeoff. The allocation should be based on the assets’ expected returns, volatilities, and correlations with each other.

#### **MAPC Score and Its Connection to MPT:**

The MAPC score measures the contribution of each asset or strategy to the overall active return of a portfolio. The goal is to construct a portfolio that maximizes the MAPC score while managing the overall risk.

- **Active Return:**  The return that exceeds the benchmark return. It is generated by actively managing the portfolio, choosing investments that are expected to outperform the market or a relevant benchmark.
- **MAPC:**  The Maximum Active Portfolio Contribution score evaluates how well a strategy or asset contributes to achieving a positive active return. Higher MAPC means the asset/strategy has a larger positive impact on the portfolio’s active return.

#### **Enhancing MAPC Score Using MPT Principles:**

1. **Maximizing Diversification:**
   - By diversifying the portfolio, you reduce the risk of overconcentration in specific assets or sectors. This enables more consistent and stable returns, which can boost the MAPC score by minimizing portfolio volatility.
   - Utilize low-correlation assets that complement each other to minimize the portfolio’s overall risk.
2. **Optimizing Asset Allocation:**
   - MPT helps identify the optimal asset allocation based on the correlation and risk of assets. By finding the ideal mix of asset classes, you can maximize returns without taking on excessive risk.
   - The right allocation helps improve active returns, which directly impacts the MAPC score.
3. **Utilizing the Efficient Frontier:**
   - By constructing a portfolio that lies on the Efficient Frontier, you ensure that your portfolio is optimized for risk-adjusted returns. This not only helps with maximizing returns but also minimizes unnecessary risk, which can enhance the MAPC score.
   - Focus on selecting assets that lie on or near the Efficient Frontier to balance risk and return effectively.
4. **Factor in Risk-Adjusted Returns:**
   - In addition to simply focusing on returns, MPT emphasizes risk-adjusted returns (e.g., Sharpe ratio). Strategies that focus on achieving better risk-adjusted returns can help you build a portfolio that contributes to a higher MAPC score, as the active return will be more robust over time.
5. **Minimizing Risk Exposure:**
   - MPT’s focus on reducing risk exposure through diversification and selecting assets with low or negative correlation helps enhance the portfolio’s risk-return profile.
   - By minimizing risk without sacrificing return, you ensure that active returns contribute positively to the MAPC score.
6. **Monitoring and Adjusting:**
   - MPT involves continual monitoring and adjustments to ensure the portfolio remains optimal. This may involve rebalancing the portfolio when market conditions change or when new information becomes available.
   - Regular adjustments can help maintain or improve the MAPC score over time, ensuring that the portfolio remains aligned with its goals.
7. **Applying Advanced Optimization Techniques:**
   - You can use advanced portfolio optimization techniques (like quadratic programming) to find the best possible portfolio weights that maximize active returns while maintaining the desired risk level.
   - Optimization techniques that balance multiple factors can help boost the MAPC score by making the portfolio more efficient.

#### **Practical Steps to Apply MPT for Enhancing MAPC:**

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather historical data for the assets in your portfolio, including returns, volatilities, and correlations.
2. **Risk and Return Estimation:**
   - Estimate the expected returns and standard deviations for each asset, and calculate their correlation and covariance.
3. **Construct the Efficient Frontier:**
   - Use optimization techniques to generate the Efficient Frontier for your portfolio. Determine the optimal asset allocation that maximizes returns for the given level of risk.
4. **Portfolio Construction:**
   - Build a portfolio using the optimal allocation found on the Efficient Frontier. Use low-correlation assets to reduce risk and increase diversification.
5. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Continuously monitor the performance of the portfolio, adjusting asset weights as needed based on market changes or shifts in asset correlations.
6. **Maximize Active Return:**
   - Focus on strategies that can generate active returns, such as sector rotation, factor investing, or market timing, while maintaining a diversified portfolio.

By incorporating Modern Portfolio Theory into your portfolio construction and management process, you can maximize the potential for high MAPC scores. This approach helps you balance risk and return, leading to a more optimized portfolio that contributes positively to active returns.

MAPC evaluates the merged performance of your submitted Alphas by combining them equally, calculating metrics like Sharpe ratio, Returns/Drawdown ratio, and turnover. By applying principles from  **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** , you can enhance your Merged Performance Score.

### **Key Insights from MPT**

1. **Expected Return Calculation**
   - The expected return of the merged portfolio is the  **weighted average of individual Alphas’ expected returns** . With equal weighting, each Alpha contributes equally (weight = 1/n, where n = number of Alphas).
2. **Variance and Risk Reduction**
   - Portfolio variance determines overall risk. By including  **low or negatively correlated Alphas** , risks can offset each other, leading to a smoother return profile.
   - **Lower correlation = Reduced portfolio variance = Higher Sharpe ratio.**

### **Why Correlated Alphas Hurt Your Score**

- Submitting highly correlated Alphas increases portfolio risk and reduces the Sharpe ratio, leading to  **negative scores** . Diversifying by submitting  **uncorrelated Alphas**  minimizes this risk and improves the portfolio's performance.

### **Additional Ways to Improve the Merged Performance Score**

1. **Neutralizing Factor Risks**
   - Major drawdowns may arise from specific risk factors like:
   - Hedge fund ownership.
   - Short interest.
   - Momentum factors.
   - **Solution** : Neutralize Alphas to these risks using tools like  **Data Explorer** . Neutralizing size, volatility, and other well-documented risks also improves diversification.
2. **Lowering Turnover**
   - High turnover increases costs and instability. Instead of raising decay, refine Alpha signals with tools like:
   - **ts_decay_exp_window** : Applies exponential decay for smoother signals.
   - Explore operators that maintain signal quality while reducing turnover.
