## 帖子正文

I am currently at the gold genius level. I want to reach to grandmaster level.
I have figured out that it is achievable, just need regular hard work and dedication. But apart from hard work and dedication i will also need strategy to achieve the grandmaster level with more surety.

I need to  **atleast**  submit more than  **220 alphas**  with  **60 pyramids,** along with keeping up  **2+ alpha performance score**  and simultaneously working to better my scores in  **tie breaker criteria.**

I need help with strategies, so i can do all the work efficiently and also keep up atleast one of my alpha performance score. I request to consultants who have already achieved it to guide for the current scenarios:

- How to get more than  **220 alphas and 60 pyramids with a tittle less effort**  ?
- How to  **better alpha performance score**  ?
- What should be done to achieve  **better score in tie breaker**  criterias ?
- How to achieve  **most possible operators and fields count**  ?

Here’s how to meet the Grandmaster level criteria from Gold level, in clear point form:

✅ Alpha Quality

High Information Coefficient (IC)

Consistently positive performance

Works across different time periods (robust)

🔁 Turnover Requirements

Match GLB High Turnover standards (e.g. Multiplier ≥ 2)

Tune parameters like ts_decay, ts_delay, ts_rank to control turnover

🎯 Low Production Correlation

prod_correlation < 0.3

self_correlation < 0.6

Ensure diversity vs existing production alphas

⚙️ Simplicity

Keep operator count < 10

Avoid deep nesting and overly complex formulas

📊 Data Diversity

Use different data categories:

mdl110_* (analyst & technical)

mws* (sentiment/alternative)

anl14_*, fnd23_* (fundamentals)

star_*, oth* (machine learning, alternative)

🧪 Backtest Robustness

Use:

ts_backfill(...)

group_zscore(...)

group_neutralize(..., sector/subindustry)

Test over long periods

🧠 Alpha Innovation

Avoid redundancy (don’t copy existing production alpha logic)

Create original, uncorrelated signals

📈 Combo & Portfolio Impact

Your alpha should add value in combo (SuperAlpha, ProdPool)

Track Portfolio Contribution Score (PCS) – needs to exceed set threshold

---

🧭 Action Steps

Improve top-performing alphas

Create 10+ new diverse alphas

Use combo tests to evaluate portfolio value

Monitor IC, turnover, correlation in stats

Apply for promotion when ready (on WebSim)

This is quite a big and nuanced question — I say this as someone who just promoted  **directly from Gold to GrandMaster** .

Here are four things you absolutely need to ensure:

1. Is your output volume sufficient?
2. Is your alpha quality consistently strong?
3. Can you fill most of the pyramids — including both D0 and D1? (This is essential at the Gold and Expert level.)
4. Do you fully understand the decisive impact of the Tie-Breaker on Genius Level promotions?

Once you’ve got those covered, it's all about developing a strong intuition for Combined Performance — understanding what’s noise vs. signal, and how to build clean, simple, meaningful Alphas that really contribute. (JZC)

Also, be prepared to:

- **Endure face scans every four hours**
- **Join every Brain Opportunity Webinar**  for Community Score
- **Keep your Max Sim Streak alive at all costs**

Thanks for the detailed tips! Focusing on alpha quality, diversity, low correlation, and robust backtesting makes sense. I’ll also prioritize filling pyramids and monitoring combo contribution to improve my chances of reaching Grandmaster.

Reaching Grandmaster from Gold in the current platform environment requires balancing  **quantity** ,  **quality** , and  **diversity** . For the alpha and pyramid targets (220+ alphas, 60+ pyramids), batching your research process is key—design thematic “alpha families” where multiple variants are created by tweaking parameters, operators, or universes. This accelerates count without reinventing from scratch. To keep alpha performance scores ≥2, maintain a core set of robust templates and apply rigorous validation (e.g., Sub-universe Sharpe, turnover control, correlation checks) before submission. For tie-breakers, maximize  **operator variety**  by intentionally incorporating less-used but stable operators (e.g., hump, decay variations, group-neutralization) into otherwise solid signals. Also, diversify  **fields count**  by tapping underutilized datasets—microstructure, fundamentals, sentiment—and rotating through different universes. Time management matters: allocate fixed daily/weekly slots for idea generation, backtesting, and curation so the work remains consistent over months without burnout.
