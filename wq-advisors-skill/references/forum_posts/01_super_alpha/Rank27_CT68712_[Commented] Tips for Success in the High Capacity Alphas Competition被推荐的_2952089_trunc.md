## 帖子正文

In High Capacity Alphas Competition (HCAC), it's important to focus on submitting high-scoring Alphas. Here are some tips:

1. **Keep Turnover Less Than 10%:**

- Alphas need to have a turnover of less than 10%.
- For turnover < 5%, Sharpe should be >= 1.75 to get a score > 0.
- For turnover between 5% and 10%, Sharpe should be >= 2.0 to get a score > 0.

1. **Submit High-Scoring Alphas:**

- It's important for your total score to submit Alphas with a score > 0.
- The total score formula is (sum of all Alphas' scores) / sqrt(count of Alphas), so submitting an Alpha with a score of 0 can significantly impact your overall score.

## Actionable Tips to Increase Your Score:

1. **Revise Your Simulated and Submitted Alphas:**

- Select those with Sharpe > 2 or > 3 in the GLB or USA region.

1. **Implement Techniques to Lower Turnover:**

- Use ts_decay_linear, hump and trade_when operators.
- Check new operators available for HCAC participants, regardless of their Genius Level:

1. **Control Turnover:**

- Use ts_target_tvr_hump(), where the target_tvr parameter will be the turnover you want to achieve. This operator can help reduce turnover without a significant drop in Sharpe:
  ts_target_tvr_hump(signal, lambda_min=0, lambda_max=1, target_tvr=0.05)

1. **Use Risk Neutralizations:**

- Apply risk neutralizations in settings but manage turnover, as some neutralizations might increase the turnover of your original signal.

Hi, According to the formula you presented, if you want a high IS score, each alpha submitting an assignment must have a high score and prioritize quality over quantity, is that correct?

Used the operators ts_target_tvr_hump , ts_target_tvr_delta_limit , ts_decay_exp_window,hump and saw that the revenue was quite low but my sharpe decreased from the original by quite a large amount, about 30%. Will this affect the Combie Performent Alpha score in Genius?

### 评论 #6 (作者: LK40143, 时间: 1年前)

Thank you for the tips. Now I understand the operators that reduce turnover, as it has been the problem for most of the alphas.

---

### 评论 #7 (作者: DP11917, 时间: 1年前)

**Turnover < 5%** : Aim for a  **Sharpe ratio of >= 1.75** . This is essential for making sure your Alpha is in a high-performing range. **Turnover between 5% and 10%** : To maintain a high score, your  **Sharpe ratio should be >= 2.0** . The goal is to keep turnover low while maximizing the risk-adjusted return.

### 评论 #15 (作者: XX42289, 时间: 1年前)

Thanks for sharing these tips—they’re incredibly helpful! I’ve been experimenting with  `ts_target_tvr_hump`  and  `ts_decay_exp_window`  to reduce turnover, but I’ve noticed a slight drop in Sharpe ratios. Are there specific parameter tweaks or combinations of operators you’d recommend to minimize this trade-off? Also, are there certain types of data or regions that tend to produce Alphas with naturally lower turnover? Excited to refine my approach further!

### 评论 #18 (作者: NT63388, 时间: 1年前)

Thank you for your detailed analysis and sharing.
In my case, I can control low turnover by selecting appropriate DFs combined with the ts_ operator, using day with quarterly or yearly frequencies.

### 评论 #19 (作者: AB15407, 时间: 1年前)

In the Seminar on January 7, 2025, I noticed that the Alphas with high OS performance tended to have quite high turnover!
This goes against the criteria of the HCAC2025 competition, so I’m a bit concerned. If I submit too many Alphas for the competition, will it affect the overall quality of my Alphas?

[AB15047](/hc/en-us/profiles/13803349177495-AB15047)  If you have a high pool of alphas in USA and GLB already it will probably improve your overall combined alpha performance, however if you have only a few - the sharpe may decrease if you are not confident in your alphas to have a high OS score. Also, even if you have a few alphas in the aforementioned regions it would make sense to submit HCAC alphas that lead to a high merged performance - this will likely not cause too much of a decrease in overall quality!

### 评论 #30 (作者: SC43474, 时间: 1年前)

**Great discussion on risk neutralizations and turnover!**  I recently tried applying  `ts_decay_exp_window`  to stabilize my signals, but it unexpectedly amplified turnover when combined with event-driven Alphas. I suspect it’s due to abrupt signal shifts during earnings season. Have you encountered similar issues, and if so, how do you mitigate turnover spikes in event-based strategies?

1. **Optimize Position Sizing** : Adjust the size of your positions based on the strength of your signals and associated risks. Smaller positions can help reduce turnover while still allowing you to capture market opportunities, minimizing transaction costs and market impact.
2. **Implement Trade Filters** : Set specific criteria for executing trades, such as minimum expected returns or maximum volatility. This helps you focus on higher-quality trades, reducing unnecessary turnover and enhancing overall decision-making.
3. **Strategic Rebalancing** : Instead of rebalancing at fixed intervals, consider doing so based on market conditions or performance thresholds. This approach can lower turnover by reducing the frequency of trades while maintaining a balanced portfolio.
4. **Focus on High-Quality Signals** : Ensure your trading signals are robust and reliable. Invest in backtesting to understand how different turnover levels affect performance metrics. By prioritizing high-quality signals, you can achieve better results with fewer trades, mitigating turnover's impact.

[NM12321](/hc/en-us/profiles/9541480653463-NM12321)

Decay is the only method in settings that you can use to reduce turnover. Alternatively, you can try different operators in your Alphas, such as  **trade_when**  or  **hump**  to reduce turnover. Since these approaches serve different purposes, they will produce very different results.

**Impact of Low-Scoring Alphas**  – Submitting Alphas with a score of 0 significantly reduces your total score due to the formula: (sum of all Alphas' scores) / sqrt(count of Alphas). Prioritize high-scoring Alphas to maximize performance.

**Turnover Constraints and Sharpe Ratio**  – Alphas with a turnover > 10% are not viable. If turnover < 5%, ensure Sharpe ≥ 1.75; if turnover is 5%-10%, aim for Sharpe ≥ 2.0 to maintain a positive score.

In addition to controlling turnover and optimizing Sharpe, the stability of an alpha over time and its scalability are also crucial. Alphas should maintain strong performance across different market conditions and be applicable on a larger scale without losing effectiveness. Additionally, checking the correlation between alphas helps avoid signal redundancy and minimizes transaction costs resulting from high turnover
