**Hello everyone,**

Many of you have shared your approaches to building alpha, but for new consultants, it can still feel quite challenging. In this post, I’d like to share the process I’ve been using to create alpha.

### **1. Simulate Raw Data**

The first step is to simulate raw data instead of collecting real-world data.

**Objective:**  Create a standardized dataset that accurately reflects the structure and characteristics of the financial market to serve as input for alpha development.

**Method:**

- Use simulation tools or historical data as sources to generate price and trading volume data.
- Include basic components such as opening price (open), highest price (high), lowest price (low), closing price (close), and trading volume (volume).

### **2. Build Alpha Signals Using Mathematical Operators**

From raw data, alpha signals are generated using quantitative operations:

**Steps:**

- Utilize basic operators from a list, such as  `log_diff` ,  `abs` ,  `nan_out` ,  `max` ,  `min` , or  `multiply` , to transform raw data into signals.
- Combine nonlinear functions like  `exp` ,  `log` , or conditional logic ( `cond ? expr1 : expr2` ) to create more complex and market-appropriate signals.

**Example:**

- `alpha_1 = log_diff(close)`
- `alpha_2 = max(high, low)`
- `alpha_3 = multiply(log_diff(close), log_diff(volume))`

### **3. Inner Correlation Testing**

Once the alpha signals are built, conduct an inner correlation test to eliminate redundant signals.

**Implementation:**

- Use the  **inner correlation index**  (pre-calculated in the alpha list) to evaluate the degree of correlation between alpha signals.
- Remove redundant or overlapping signals with a correlation higher than 0.7.

**Principles:**

- Retain complex or effective alpha signals.
- Remove simple signals, such as raw data ( `log_diff` ,  `abs` , etc.), if they don’t provide additional value.

### **4. Combine Alpha Signals to Create New Signals**

After filtering the alpha signals, I combine the remaining ones using basic mathematical operations to create new alpha signals.

**Basic Operations:**

- **Addition (+):**  Aggregating signals.
- **Subtraction (-):**  Analyzing differences.
- **Multiplication (*):**  Amplifying signals.
- **Division (/):**  Calculating ratios.

This combination process helps uncover more complex relationships between signals and enhances predictive value.

### **Benefits of This Process**

1. **Signal Optimization:**  Reduces redundancy and focuses on independent, effective signals.
2. **Improved Predictive Value:**  Combining alpha signals generates stronger and more flexible predictive signals.
3. **Increased Submission Count:**  By creating new alpha signals through the combination of existing ones, the number of alpha submissions increases significantly while maintaining low redundancy.
4. **Systematic Process:**  A clear, repeatable, and scalable process that can adapt to new market conditions.

This framework ensures that the final alpha portfolio is both streamlined and highly independent, optimizing the quality and quantity of signals, thereby enhancing effectiveness in financial markets.

"Combine Alpha Signals to Create New Signals" can introduce noise or, in riskier cases, create extremely poor-performing Alphas in Out-of-Sample (OS) due to potential strong reversals. This is particularly true when using operators like (*) and (/). Be cautious with such combinations and apply them only when you have a clear and well-supported idea, rather than simply trying to create qualifying Alphas for submission.

Hi  [VP21767](/hc/en-us/profiles/26211615431319-VP21767)   ,while combining alphas enhances predictive power, an excessive number of transformations or combinations can introduce noise and lead to overfitting. Applying techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or autoencoders can help identify the most orthogonal and informative signals, maintaining a diverse yet robust alpha pool. It’s also worth testing alphas across multiple market regimes to ensure their stability over time.
