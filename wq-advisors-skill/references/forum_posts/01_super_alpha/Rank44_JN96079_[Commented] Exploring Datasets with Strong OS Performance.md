Hi All,

I’m curious about which datasets have historically produced the most consistent  **out-of-sample (OS) performance** . Beyond the commonly used  **fundamental**  and  **model**  datasets, I’m interested in learning whether other, less frequently explored sources might carry untapped potential.

For example:

- Have people seen durable results from  **sentiment**  or  **news-based**  datasets?
- Do  **risk metrics**  or alternative factors play a meaningful role in boosting robustness?
- Are there overlooked datasets that tend to generalize better OS despite not being “popular” starting points?

Would love to hear from anyone who has experimented broadly and can share insights on which dataset families seem to add the most  **diversification and stability**  beyond the standard options.

Thanks in advance!

From my experience, the datasets that deliver the most consistent OS performance are those adding  *orthogonal information*  rather than overlapping with fundamentals or model features—for example, risk and volatility metrics (like beta or idiosyncratic risk) tend to improve robustness even if they don’t generate standalone alpha, while sentiment or news datasets can work but require heavy preprocessing to avoid regime-specific noise; alternative sources such as supply chain or analyst revisions may generalize well if carefully normalized; and even overlooked basics like liquidity or turnover often prove surprisingly stable, especially for scaling—so overall, durability tends to come less from novelty and more from how datasets are transformed and integrated into the broader framework.

You can do a datafield combination, where you use price-volume data fields to boost your signal strength.

Consistent out-of-sample (OS) performance often comes from datasets that add unique, non-overlapping/not overused dataset , information rather than simply expanding on fundamentals or models.

Risk and volatility metrics, for example, tend to improve robustness and stability, even if they don’t deliver standalone alpha. Sentiment and news-based datasets can be valuable but require careful preprocessing to reduce noise and regime dependence. Alternative sources—like supply chain data, analyst revisions, or liquidity/turnover fields—can also prove surprisingly durable when properly normalized.

By strategically combining multiple price and volume data fields, you can significantly enhance the robustness and strength of your trading signal.

Really interesting question. From what I’ve seen, the datasets that hold up best out-of-sample are usually the ones that  **add orthogonal information**  rather than just more of the same. For example, risk/volatility measures (like idiosyncratic risk or factor betas) often don’t shine as standalone signals, but they consistently improve robustness when layered into a framework.

Sentiment/news can work too, but they’re very  **regime-sensitive** —if you don’t normalize properly or account for structural shifts, you end up chasing noise. On the flip side, I’ve been surprised by how durable some “basic” fields like  **liquidity, turnover, and supply-chain exposures**  can be when treated thoughtfully. They’re not flashy, but they often travel well across time and markets.

Curious to hear if others have found similarly “boring” datasets outperform the trendy ones once you get to OS testing.

Great question! Historically, fundamentals and model datasets are solid, but I’ve heard sentiment/news-based signals can add incremental value if smoothed properly. Risk metrics sometimes help with stability rather than pure alpha. Curious to see if others have had success with alternative or niche datasets—thanks for raising this.

Great question! Beyond fundamentals and model datasets, exploring sentiment, news, alt-data, and risk metrics often reveals hidden OS robustness. These can enhance diversification, stability, and help uncover overlooked edges in building stronger signals.

- **Sentiment/News:**  Short-term headline sentiment often decays, but earnings tone, guidance language, and analyst revision sentiment can hold up OS.
- **Risk/Style Metrics:**  Not strong alpha drivers alone, but they improve robustness and help condition other signals. Style factors (quality, leverage, profitability) generalize better than expected.
- **Overlooked Sources:**  Ownership/flow data (institutional holdings, ETF flows, insider trades) and liquidity proxies often add diversification and stability.

👉 In short: combining fundamentals with sentiment, risk metrics, and ownership/flow datasets usually yields the most consistent OS performance.

Great topic, While fundamentals and model datasets are solid, adding less common ones often improves results. Sentiment and news data can help if cleaned properly, while risk measures like volatility give more stable out-of-sample performance. Alternative sources such as supply chain data, ESG factors, or online behavior trends can also add steady value when combined with the basics. The key is mixing different datasets to avoid over-relying on one type and to make models more robust and diversified.

Great question! Exploring less common datasets such as news, sentiment, or risk metrics can indeed add valuable diversification and stability in out-of-sample performance. In practice, these datasets may not always outperform on their own, but when thoughtfully combined with fundamentals and model-based data, they can reduce reliance on a single source and enhance long-term robustness.

Great question—besides fundamentals and model sets, I’ve seen sentiment, news, and risk datasets add OS robustness and diversification.

Great question! 👍 From what I’ve seen, the datasets that hold up best out-of-sample are usually the ones that add something  *different*  instead of repeating what fundamentals or models already cover. Risk and volatility measures often make signals more stable, even if they don’t create alpha on their own. Sentiment and news can work too, but they need careful cleaning to avoid noise. Interestingly, even simple things like liquidity or turnover data can be surprisingly reliable when used well. Mixing these kinds of datasets with the standard ones often gives a more balanced and durable performance.

Excellent point! While datasets like news, sentiment, or risk metrics may not consistently outperform in isolation, they can be powerful when integrated with fundamentals and model-driven data. This combination reduces dependence on any single source and often leads to stronger diversification, improved stability, and greater resilience in out-of-sample performance.

In addition to fundamentals and model datasets, looking into sentiment, news, alternative data, and risk metrics can often uncover hidden OS robustness. Incorporating these elements helps improve diversification, enhance stability, and reveal overlooked edges when developing stronger signals.

Great Question! I have seen sentiment and news datasets add value in specific market conditions, especially when combined with strong risk metric. Alternative factors like volatility or behavioral indicators often help to improve robustness.

Thanks for raising this—really interesting topic!

From my experience, while fundamental and model datasets remain reliable, there’s definitely value in exploring less traditional sources:

Sentiment and news-based datasets can capture short-term market reactions that fundamentals might miss. They often add diversification and can improve out-of-sample robustness, especially when combined with traditional factors.

Risk metrics and alternative factors (like liquidity, volatility regimes, or cross-asset signals) sometimes help stabilize returns and improve Sharpe ratios across different market conditions.

Some overlooked datasets, like sector-specific or supply-chain indicators, have shown potential for generalizing well OS, even though they’re less popular.

In short, blending traditional and unconventional datasets—while carefully monitoring for overfitting—seems to offer the best chance of stable, diversified out-of-sample performance.

###### Exploring beyond fundamentals and standard model datasets is valuable—sentiment, news flow, and alternative data often add diversification. OS consistency seems strongest when combining uncorrelated sources. Curious to hear if others found niche datasets that improved robustness in real trading.

Although sentiment and news data are often noisy, they can produce strong OS signals when paired with smoothing or ranking algorithms.

Metrics of risk and volatility are helpful for controlling turnover and normalization. They stabilize Sharpe, which strengthens combos even though they don't always create independent alphas.

Alternative datasets: When combined with price-based features, elements like social media or analyst revisions can increase diversity and decrease correlation.
