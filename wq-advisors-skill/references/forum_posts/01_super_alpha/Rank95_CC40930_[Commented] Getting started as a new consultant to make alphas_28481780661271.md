Here are a few tips that might me helpful if you are yet to submit an alpha or have just started to submit a few (feel free to add more points in comments plus correct me wherever i might be wrong)-

1) Get your basics strong , you can read about fundamental ratios and the inferences you can make from them and at least know the basic technical indicators to begin with . With more time going forward we can go into more complex stuff related to algo trading strategies or ml models(not required at the beginning ) .

2) Watch all the videos in the learn section plus read the documentation page a few times there is almost everything that you require to start out.

3) Use the alpha examples in the documentation and read the logic behind them now you can start out with improving the signal by using the hints provided in the examples. Once you are able to do this much and get a submittable signal out of the examples then we can move forward to finding similar ideas to those in examples but now by ourself.

4) Now assuming that you are able to at least come up with an idea now this one is my personal advice might not be correct but I find it hard to get started with the USA region because of high correlation so i would suggest to start out with GLB or ASI region ( I think US , ASI , GLB , EUR have the same weightage ) .

5) So in GLB or ASI region we can start with using the most basic operators zscore , ts_zscore , rank , ts_rank which was told to me during one of the session in consultant competitions this makes it easy to recognise which fields you can use for your alpha . Use MINVOL1M to start with you get better signals here compared to TOP3000 .

6) Neutralisations - now risk handled neutralizations might be better to use for your alphas and i think we were told to use them to reduce correlation as well but as of now i find the niche neutralizations to have lower prod correlation might be due to a lot of submissions in the risk handled ones plus the niche neutralizations take comparatively way less time to run (for me).

7) Before submitting any alphas make sure you have the test period on and at least have 2 years of testing data to affirm whether your alpha performs well or not there . You can refer to more tests here -  [[Commented] Robustness Test_25238340364695.md]([Commented] Robustness Test_25238340364695.md)

8) Whenever you choose any data field to work with you can see what's the coverage for that data field . If you are working with low coverage data fields you can use ts_backfill or other related operators . More info here -  [https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/articles/19248385997719-Weight-Coverage-common-issues-and-advice](/hc/en-us/articles/19248385997719-Weight-Coverage-common-issues-and-advice)

9) When you add two datafields make sure to scale them down to similar limits .

10) Try to avoid overfitting the alphas to pass the tests or add noise to reduce correlation as it might affect your OS performance.

11) Ask any doubts you have in this forum or any other forum , your advisor and other consultants will be more than happy to help you with your doubts.

This might me sufficient enough to get started with your journey as a fellow consultant . I might add more points below if required.

Happy learning !

This guide is a goldmine for anyone starting their alpha journey! The focus on mastering the basics—like ratios, indicators, and starting with simpler regions—is spot on. Using operators like zscore and ts_zscore to identify signals is a smart strategy.

A key tip: always check your data’s quality and freshness. Even small discrepancies can skew results. Also, don’t overlook the power of experimenting with different neutralization strategies—small tweaks can drastically improve your alpha's performance.

Alpha development is all about iteration. Embrace the trial and error process, as that's where breakthroughs happen.

Amazing work here—can’t wait to see more! Keep it up!

This is a great and detailed guide for anyone just starting out with alpha submissions or working on their first few! I especially like the focus on starting with strong fundamentals and the advice on avoiding overfitting.

A couple of additional thoughts:

- It might be helpful to mention the importance of  **keeping track of performance metrics**  like Sharpe ratio, alpha, and beta when evaluating your alpha’s success. These are crucial to understanding how your alpha behaves in various market conditions.
- It could also be useful to  **experiment with different data sources**  or  **feature engineering**  techniques over time. Once you're comfortable with the basics, trying different ways to transform your features can uncover new patterns and improve alpha performance.
- **Collaboration**  is key. Sharing ideas or asking for feedback in the community can sometimes provide a fresh perspective and help identify areas you might have missed.

But overall, great tips for anyone getting started. Best of luck to all!

Thanks for sharing the detailed roadmap. I realized I have been on the same journey since I started alpha on Brain.

### 评论 #8 (作者: LN92324, 时间: 1年前)

Your sharing is really helpful for new consultants. When I first joined Brain, I also had many difficulties due to lack of experience. At that time, when I found an alpha that could be submitted, I usually submitted it right away. Now, I think new consultants can start with Fundamental and Model datasets. Once they have experience, then when they decide to move on to more difficult datasets, it will be easier for them.

1) **Strengthen Your Basics**: Start by familiarizing yourself with fundamental ratios (like P/E, P/B, ROE) and what insights they provide about a company's financial health. Also, learn the basic technical indicators (like moving averages, RSI, MACD) to understand price action. As you progress, you can delve into more advanced topics like algorithmic trading strategies and machine learning models, but focus on the fundamentals first.

2) **Utilize Learning Resources**: Watch all the videos in the "Learn" section and read the documentation carefully. These resources cover essential concepts and tools you'll need to get started. Revisit the documentation a few times to reinforce your understanding and ensure you have a solid foundation before diving deeper.

Thank you for your great contribution. For new consultants, it can be challenging to decide which dataset to use for each region. I would like to add some advice: try using the Data page feature. Create filters to select datasets that have been used moderately (too low may be hard to work with, too high could lead to production correlation being too high). Once you have gained stability, you can then research more challenging datasets.
