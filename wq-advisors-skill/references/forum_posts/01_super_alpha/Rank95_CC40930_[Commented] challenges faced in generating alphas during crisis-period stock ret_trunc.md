### **Challenges Faced**

1. **Increased Market Volatility**
   - Crisis periods are characterized by extreme price swings, leading to unstable signals and noisy data.
   - Traditional relationships (e.g., valuation metrics or momentum trends) may break down, reducing the reliability of historical alphas.
2. **Behavioral and Sentiment Shifts**
   - Investor behavior changes during crises, with increased panic, herding, or risk aversion, making pre-crisis patterns less effective.
   - Sentiment-based alphas may overreact to news or noise, creating false positives.
3. **Liquidity Constraints**
   - Reduced liquidity in crisis conditions impacts trading execution, increasing costs and slippage for alpha strategies.
4. **Macroeconomic Dominance**
   - Broader macroeconomic trends and systemic risks dominate stock-specific fundamentals, diluting idiosyncratic alpha signals.
5. **Overfitting Risk**
   - Crisis-specific data is sparse, increasing the risk of overfitting models to rare events that may not generalize to future crises.
6. **Survivorship Bias**
   - Companies that perform poorly during crises may drop out of datasets, leading to biased backtesting results.

### **Potential Solutions**

1. **Adaptive Modeling**
   - Use dynamic alphas that adapt to changing volatility regimes through techniques like rolling windows or volatility scaling.
   - Incorporate crisis-specific factors such as risk aversion proxies (e.g., VIX index) into alpha models.
2. **Sentiment and Behavioral Adjustments**
   - Combine sentiment signals with longer-term fundamentals to reduce overreliance on short-term noise.
   - Use alternative datasets (e.g., credit spreads, options data) to gauge investor sentiment more comprehensively.
3. **Robust Backtesting**
   - Include stress-testing scenarios and out-of-sample validation for alpha models.
   - Test alphas across various historical crisis periods to ensure generalizability.
4. **Liquidity Adjustments**
   - Integrate liquidity filters to prioritize assets with adequate trading volumes.
   - Adjust trading strategies to account for higher transaction costs and market impact during crises.
5. **Diversification**
   - Use portfolio construction techniques like risk parity or factor diversification to spread risks across multiple alpha sources.
   - Avoid overconcentration in sectors highly sensitive to crisis conditions.
6. **Macroeconomic Integration**
   - Incorporate macro factors like interest rates, currency volatility, or commodity prices into alpha models.
   - Adjust weights dynamically based on macroeconomic signals or regimes.
7. **Machine Learning and Alternative Techniques**
   - Leverage machine learning to uncover non-linear relationships or rare patterns that are more pronounced during crises.
   - Explore event-driven strategies that capitalize on specific crisis-triggered announcements or policy changes.

For managing shifting market conditions, your strategy of incorporating dynamic alphas that adapt to shifting volatility regimes is ideal. 
Using alternative datasets, such credit spreads or options data, adds a thorough layer to sentiment analysis, and your recommendation to integrate sentiment signals with long-term fundamentals is crucial for avoiding an excessive dependence on short-term noise. Incorporating strong backtesting scenarios, especially during past crises, guarantees that models are resilient during stressful times in addition to being effective in typical market situations.

In order to maximise returns while controlling volatility brought on by the crisis, liquidity adjustments and diversified portfolio construction—especially through strategies like risk parity—will be helpful. Additionally, a well-rounded, adaptable strategy is produced by combining macroeconomic variables with dynamic weight modifications based on more general economic signals.

During crisis periods, both market volatility and investor behavior shifts make traditional alphas (based on historical data, momentum, or sentiment) more susceptible to false signals and losses. To counteract these challenges, it's important to adjust your models to handle extreme price swings, incorporate volatility-adjusted measures, and refine sentiment models to avoid overreacting to market noise. A diversified approach that blends multiple strategies can improve the robustness of your trading model and help you navigate crisis periods more effectively.

During crises, extreme price swings can make signals highly unstable. As you mentioned, traditional valuation metrics or momentum trends can often break down under volatile conditions. This can lead to increased noise in the data, where normal patterns become difficult to identify, and the risk of following a misleading signal rises.
