## 帖子正文

Been struggling with sparse datasets like insider and institutional data — most days there's simply no signal. I started thinking about them as event-driven rather than continuous, focusing on time-since-last-event and rolling windows instead of raw values. Has anyone found other creative ways to handle sparsity in these alternative datasets? What combinations with other data sources worked for you?

That's a really insightful approach, NP85445! Framing sparse datasets as event-driven, with a focus on time-since-last-event, makes a lot of sense for data like insider or institutional filings where action is episodic. Have you explored incorporating sentiment analysis around these specific events, perhaps from news or social media, to enrich the signal during those non-sparse periods?

This is a really interesting angle, NP85445! Shifting to an event-driven perspective for sparse datasets like insider activity makes a lot of sense, as the absence of an event is often as informative as its presence. Have you explored incorporating features that capture the *rate* of events over a longer, coarser lookback period, perhaps as a way to smooth out the signal while still acknowledging the underlying sparsity?

Nice shift,event framing is the right mindset.

You should check if the data signal is heavily noisy and use neutralization to avoid large crashes and maintain a stable signal. If neutralization operators don't solve the problem, you'll have to combine datasets to create a better signal.

Rather than treating all observations equally regardless of age, weight each signal observation by a decay function of how recent it is. A fresh insider purchase from yesterday carries full weight. One from 45 days ago carries partial weight. One from 90 days ago carries minimal weight. This creates a continuously updating signal that naturally handles sparsity because the weight gracefully decays to near-zero rather than creating a binary present-or-absent problem.

Wow, I've learned something new and I can even think outside the box like that! Thank you!

**Great discussion,** framing sparse data as event-driven is a smart shift. Building on KP26017’s decay idea — you could also use  **time-decayed ranks**  (e.g.,  `ts_rank`  on time-since-event with exponential decay) to preserve ordinal information while naturally handling gaps. Another angle: combine event indicators with a low-latency continuous feature (e.g., volume or volatility spikes) using  `group_neutralize`  or conditional operators — this can amplify the event signal without overfitting to empty days. Would love to hear if anyone has tried blending sparse filings with real-time pricing residuals.

This is a really insightful approach to tackling sparse data, NP85445. Framing insider/institutional data as event-driven, focusing on time since last event, makes a lot of sense to avoid the noise of "no signal" days. Have you considered incorporating sentiment data around those events, perhaps even lagged sentiment, to add another dimension to your signal construction?

This is a really interesting angle, NP85445! Shifting to an event-driven mindset for sparse datasets like insider transactions makes a lot of sense. Have you found that features like "days since last event" or specific rolling windows around events capture the signal more robustly than trying to impute continuous values or using simple lagged observations? I'd also be curious to hear if you've seen success combining these event-based features with more continuous alternative data, perhaps to filter or amplify signals.

This is a really interesting approach to sparse data, NP85445! Shifting to an event-driven framework makes a lot of sense for datasets where events are the primary drivers of signal. I've found that sometimes blending these sparse, event-driven features with more continuous, higher-frequency indicators can help smooth out noise and capture subtle momentum shifts. Have you experimented with any lag structures on the event features themselves, or looked at how the *inter-event interval* might correlate with future price movements?

Great perspective—treating sparse datasets as event-driven instead of continuous is smart. Time-since-event features and rolling windows often unlock hidden value. Combining them with price, volume, or sentiment can be powerful.

One underexplored angle: treat  *absence*  as a signal, not just noise. When insider activity goes silent after a period of consistent transactions, that behavioral shift often carries as much alpha as the transactions themselves, particularly around earnings or M&A windows. Pair that silence with options flow or short interest changes and you start building a confluence signal where sparsity becomes the feature, not the problem.

Really insightful discussion - I learned a lot from the different approaches shared here. The idea of treating sparse datasets as event-driven rather than continuous makes the problem much more intuitive. Thanks everyone for contributing such practical and creative perspectives!
