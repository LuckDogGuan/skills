## **Basic Statistics for Data Analysis**

Hello. Today's topic is basic statistics for data analysis. The prepared agenda is as follows.

### Agenda

1. Importance of Summary Statistics
2. What are Moments?
3. About Mean, Median, and Mode
4. Advanced Statistical Measures for Data Analysis

## **1. Importance of Summary Statistics**

Summary Statistics plays a key role in data analysis. It helps summarize data, understand the characteristics of data distribution, and make insightful decisions. The main reasons are:

- **Key summary of data** : A simple representation of the center, dispersion, and symmetry of the distribution.
- **Volatility and Outlier Detection** : Identifying variability or unusual patterns in your data.
- **Cross-distribution comparison** : Compare with other data or provide insights needed for modeling.

In particular, Moments serve as an important tool for understanding the shape of data by mathematically quantifying the characteristics of the distribution.

## 2. What are Moments?

Moments are mathematical indicators that represent various characteristics of data distribution. Moments are composed of the following important components for summarizing data:

1. **0th Moment (Sum):**
   
> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> Jo =
> 4i
> I1
 In a probability distribution, the overall probability is always 1.
2. **1st Moment (Mean)** :
   
> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> MI = M =1
> Ci
> 1
 Indicates the central location of the data.
3. **2nd Moment (Variance):**
   
> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> M
> (Ci
> 八)
> 1
> 1SC
 It indicates how spread out the data values ​​are from the mean.
4. **3rd Moment (Skewness)** :
   
> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> A3 =
> a
 Measures the asymmetry of the data distribution.
5. **4th Moment (Kurtosis)** :
   
> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> M =
> 5
 Assess the likelihood of extreme values ​​by measuring the thickness of the tails of a distribution.

Now let's take a closer look at each component and statistic of Moments.

## **3. Mean, Median, and Mode**

Mean, Median, and Mode are representative indicators that measure the central location of data, and are used to summarize data according to their characteristics and purposes. These indicators are very important as the first step in analyzing data and understanding the characteristics of the distribution.

1. **Mean** :

```
import numpy as npdata = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]mean = np.mean(data)print("Mean:", mean)
```

1. **Median** :

```
median = np.median(data)print("Median:", median)
```

1. **Mode** :

```
from scipy.stats import modemode_value = mode(data)print("Mode:", mode_value.mode[0])
```

## **4. Advanced Statistical Measures for Data Analysis**

To gain a deeper understanding of the distribution and characteristics of data, you can analyze variance, symmetry, tail thickness, and relationships between variables. These indicators quantitatively explain the variability and correlation of data, and help you discover hidden patterns in the data.

#### **Variance**

- Measures how spread out data values ​​are from the mean.
- 
> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> Variance
> Sii
> 山?
> (3i


```
variance = np.var(data)print("Variance:", variance)
```

#### **Standard Deviation**

- The square root of the variance represents the variability of the data..
- 
> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> Standard Deviation
> Variance


```
std_dev = np.std(data)print("Standard Deviation:", std_dev)
```

#### **Skewness**

- Measures the asymmetry of data distribution..
- 
> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> Ci
> Ci
> Skewness
> 卜)3


```
from scipy.stats import skewskewness = skew(data)print("Skewness:", skewness)
```

#### **Kurtosis**

- Measure the tail thickness of a distribution..
- 
> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> i_l (Ci
> 1
> Kurtosis


```
from scipy.stats import kurtosiskurt = kurtosis(data)print("Kurtosis:", kurt)
```

#### **Covariance**

- Measures the relationship between changes in two variables.
- 
> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> Sn(Xi_
> L )(r
> L
> Cov(J,I)


```
import pandas as pddf = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})covariance = df.cov()print("Covariance:\n", covariance)
```

#### **Correlation**

- Measures the linear relationship between two variables.
- 
> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> Cov(X;I)
> OIOI


```
correlation = df.corr(method='pearson')print("Correlation:\n", correlation)
```

#### **Quantile**

- A reference value that divides data into equal intervals..
- 
> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> Dpx(ntl


```
quantiles = np.percentile(data, [25, 50, 75])print("Quantiles:", quantiles)
```

In addition, you can explore the data in depth by utilizing various statistical indicators and analysis methods. Now, we hope you will use these basic statistics and advanced statistical techniques to derive more sophisticated and meaningful data analysis results!

"Excellent overview of the moments in statistics! Breaking down the moments into their individual components - mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis - provides a clear understanding of how each moment contributes to our understanding of the data distribution. The mean sets the central tendency, variance measures the spread, skewness assesses asymmetry, and kurtosis evaluates the likelihood of extreme values. Looking forward to diving deeper into each of these components and exploring their applications in data analysis!"
