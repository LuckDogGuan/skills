Instead of looking at the basic formula  *ROE = Net Income / Shareholder's Equity* , the DuPont identity breaks ROE down into its  **three core drivers** :

```
ROE = (Net Profit Margin) * (Asset Turnover) * (Equity Multiplier)
```

Each component tells a distinct story about the business:

1. **Net Profit Margin (Profitability):**  How well does the company manage costs and pricing? This is  **profit efficiency** .
2. **Asset Turnover (Efficiency):**  How effectively does the company use its assets to generate revenue? This is  **operational efficiency** .
3. **Equity Multiplier (Leverage):**  How much debt is the company using to finance its assets? This is the  **source of risk** .

**The Core Insight:**  Two companies can have the same 20% ROE. Company A achieves this through high margins and efficient operations (a sustainable business model). Company B achieves it by leveraging its equity 5-to-1 (a ticking time bomb). A simple ROE factor treats them as identical.

**Alpha Logic: Building a "Quality ROE" Score**

```
# 1. Profitability Factor: Prioritize companies with high net profit margins.profit_margin = fundamentals['net_income'] / fundamentals['revenue']profitability_factor = rank(profit_margin)# 2. Efficiency Factor: Prioritize companies with high asset turnover.asset_turnover = fundamentals['revenue'] / fundamentals['total_assets']efficiency_factor = rank(asset_turnover)# 3. Leverage Factor: Prioritize companies with LOW financial leverage.# The negative sign here is the most crucial part of this logic!debt_to_equity = fundamentals['debt_to_equity']leverage_factor = rank(-debt_to_equity)
```

In conclusion, stop using ROE as a "black box." Deconstructing it with the DuPont analysis will help you build higher-quality, safer, and more insightful Alphas.

This is an excellent breakdown of ROE into its DuPont components, and I think your alpha logic captures the essence of transforming a raw accounting metric into a more nuanced quality factor. One possible extension is to examine the dynamic interaction among the three drivers rather than treating them independently. For example, periods of rising profit margins but deteriorating asset turnover may indicate a shift in business model that is not sustainable. Similarly, combining leverage factor with measures of interest coverage could help refine the risk dimension, since not all leverage is equally dangerous. Another angle is to test whether industry-neutralization improves signal quality, as capital intensity and leverage norms vary significantly across sectors. In practice, a multi-horizon design using rolling averages of each component might also reduce noise and sharpen predictive power. Overall, this framework provides a strong foundation for designing more interpretable and robust alphas.

Great breakdown! Decomposing ROE through DuPont really highlights the quality dimension that a raw ROE factor misses. I like the negative rank on leverage — that’s a smart way to filter out “ROE by debt.” Have you tried testing this combo across regions to see if it generalizes?

Really insightful. When you decompose ROE this way, do you normalize each sub-factor before combining, or just rely on rank transformations? I wonder if weighting adjustments (e.g., stronger tilt on efficiency vs leverage) would further improve robustness.

You're absolutely right - ROE alone is misleading. A company juicing returns with 5x leverage vs one with genuine operational excellence shouldn't rank the same.

The  `rank(-debt_to_equity)`  part is key - I've seen too many "high ROE" signals blow up because they were just picking overleveraged names before they crashed.

Quick question: Have you tested this across different market caps? Wondering if the asset turnover component works differently for large vs small caps, since bigger companies often have naturally lower turnover ratios.

Great way to turn a basic fundamental into something actually useful. This kind of thinking separates good alphas from the noise.

This is a fantastic breakdown of how to turn a traditional accounting ratio into a more meaningful alpha signal. I really like how you used the DuPont framework to separate profitability, efficiency, and leverage — it’s a smart way to avoid the “black box” problem of ROE and identify which drivers are actually contributing to performance. The negative ranking on leverage is especially important for avoiding hidden risk. Thanks for sharing such a clear, actionable example — definitely a more robust approach to building quality-focused alphas!

The breakdown clearly shows that a headline metric like ROE doesn't tell the whole story—it requires dissection to uncover whether performance is driven by strength or by leverage risk. A nuanced and structured viewpoint like this supports more strategic decision-making.

An insightful breakdown highlighting how ROE, when unpacked through DuPont analysis, reveals critical dimensions of a business’s structure and strategy—not just its profitability, but its operational foundations and risk-level, too. پارӯз.Infrastructure률лириға

This presents a clear breakdown of how to transform a single metric into a nuanced, multidimensional analysis, which many shortcut-over-reality investors overlook. better signal origins_FORCE_to_profit replies ShivSymbol.

This breakdown successfully repositions Return on Equity as a multi-dimensional metric instead of a singular figure on a screen — highlighting the leadership, financial policy, and operational craftsmanship behind each number.

ROE alone can be misleading—high leverage can inflate returns. Using rank(-debt_to_equity) avoids overleveraged traps. Curious if asset turnover behaves differently across market caps, since larger firms often show lower ratios. This approach makes fundamentals truly actionable.

Great work!

This is a strong articulation of deconstructing  **ROE**  through its DuPont components, and your alpha logic really brings out how to turn a raw accounting figure into a richer quality factor. One useful extension is to examine how the three drivers  **interact dynamically** , instead of modeling each one in isolation. For instance, if profit margins are expanding while asset turnover is slipping, that could signal a structural shift in the business model that may not last.

You could also bring leverage into the picture more smartly — for example, pairing a leverage metric with  **interest coverage**  or debt service ratios to distinguish safer leverage from more precarious leverage. Because high leverage in a business with strong coverage is far less risky than in one under stress.

Another angle: consider  **industry-neutralization** . Since norms for capital intensity, margins, turnover, and leverage differ so much across sectors, neutralizing at the industry level might reduce cross-sector artifacts and make your signal purer.

In practical implementation, you could adopt a  **multi-horizon design** , using rolling averages or smoothed estimates of each component over different windows. That often helps reduce noise, avoid overreacting to short-term swings, and sharpen predictive power.

In sum, your framework is a solid foundation — adding dynamic interaction, leveraging nuance, neutralization, and smoothing can push it toward being more interpretable, stable, and robust.

Thank you for this information. ^^JN

ROE by itself can be deceptive, as high leverage may inflate returns. Applying rank(-debt_to_equity) helps avoid overleveraged firms, and considering how asset turnover varies across market caps—since larger companies often show lower ratios—makes fundamental analysis more actionable and reliable.
