Hi currently am a gold consultant and am aiming for master level, I have been able to submit over 120 signals per quarter, but my pyramids have usually been less than 10. can one have an insight of creating alphas in other regions, to help me starting venturing in new regions e.g CHINA, ASI OR EUR.
your feedback will be highly appreciated.

The alphas you have created in USA simulate them in other regions also, if the datafield not availabkle check for relevant data field for it. It can also help in checking robustnes if the same alpha works in other regions also.

Great initiative! When starting in new regions like CHN, ASI, or EUR, it’s important to first understand their liquidity patterns and coverage depth. For example, CHN often benefits from shorter decay and higher neutralization due to more volatility, while EUR tends to work well with moderate decay and stability-based factors. Begin by adapting your successful GLB or USA logic, then fine-tune decay, neutralization, and universe gradually. Diversifying across regions not only boosts your pyramid count but also helps build stronger global intuition.

That’s a great question — and it’s excellent to see your consistency in signal submissions and your ambition to reach the  **Master Consultant level** . 💪

Venturing into  **new regions**  like  **CHINA, ASI, or EUR**  is definitely a good move — it not only broadens your understanding of global market structures but also improves the  **diversification and robustness**  of your portfolio. However, there are a few key points to keep in mind as you expand beyond your current region:

1. **Understand Regional Data Behavior:**
   Each region has distinct trading patterns, liquidity structures, and factor sensitivities. For instance,  **CHINA and ASI**  markets tend to exhibit stronger short-term mean reversion and momentum decay patterns, while  **EUR**  markets often respond more to macro and valuation-driven signals.
2. **Adjust Time-Series Horizons:**
   The effectiveness of operators like  `ts_mean` ,  `ts_rank` , or  `ts_delta`  can vary by region. For example, shorter lookback windows might work better in Asia due to faster information absorption, whereas longer horizons may capture structural factors more effectively in Europe.
3. **Explore Localized Features:**
   Use features that reflect local market behavior — e.g., turnover ratios, volatility measures, or sector dispersion — as these can differ significantly across regions. You can start by modifying your strongest existing formulas slightly and testing them in the new universes to observe regional sensitivity.
4. **Neutralization & Delay Settings:**
   Always re-evaluate the impact of  `neutralization`  and  `delay`  parameters. A formula that performs well in USA TOP3000 may need  `neutralization=MARKET`  in EUR or CHINA to handle more concentrated market structures.
5. **Iterative Adaptation:**
   Instead of building entirely new formulas from scratch, take your top-performing alphas and gradually adapt them. Track their performance across  **OS, Robust Sharpe, and correlation metrics**  to identify which patterns generalize well internationally.

In short, expanding into new regions is less about “starting over” and more about  **translating your alpha intuition**  to different market environments. Begin with small adjustments, observe decay and cross-universe behavior, and use that feedback to refine your operator logic.

You’re already on a great path — reaching Master level will come naturally once your research spans more regions and shows consistent robustness. 🚀

Congratulations on maintaining such consistent signal submissions — 120 per quarter is an impressive level of productivity. Expanding into new regions like  **CHINA, ASI, or EUR**  is a great next step, especially if you’re aiming to diversify your pyramids and strengthen your path toward Master level.

When venturing into other regions, I’d recommend focusing on  **three key areas** :

1. **Data Familiarity:**
   Start by reviewing the data coverage and liquidity characteristics of your target region. Market structure, trading hours, and sector distributions can differ significantly — understanding these nuances helps you adjust your signal horizons and normalization logic.
2. **Adaptation of Existing Frameworks:**
   Instead of building entirely new Alphas, first test your  **top-performing global logic**  on the new regions with slight parameter or decay adjustments. This approach often reveals which signals generalize well and which are region-specific.
3. **Regional Behavior Exploration:**
   Once comfortable, explore operators or datasets that might capture  **local inefficiencies**  — for example, sentiment or volume anomalies that behave differently in Asia or Europe. Even small adjustments in data transformations can lead to meaningful decorrelated signals.

The best part about Brain’s multi-region datasets is that they reward both breadth and depth. Expanding geographically can strengthen your portfolio’s robustness while giving you valuable experience in cross-market behavior.

Keep experimenting systematically — regional diversification is a strong step toward sustained performance and a higher consultant tier.

Try good single dataset alphas .. it will boost your perfomance.

Great initiative! When expanding into new regions like CHN, ASI, or EUR, it’s crucial to first get a feel for each market’s liquidity characteristics and dataset coverage. CHN typically responds better to shorter decay settings and stronger neutralization because of its higher volatility, while EUR often favors medium decay values and more stability-oriented factors. A practical approach is to start by adapting the logic that already works for you in GLB or USA, then gradually adjust decay, neutralization intensity, and universe selections as you observe each region’s behavior. Exploring multiple regions not only increases your pyramid count but also strengthens your overall global market intuition.

Great goal! Exploring other regions definitely helps. Each region has different liquidity, volatility, and dataset behavior, so even simple ideas can perform very differently across CHN, ASI, or EUR.
