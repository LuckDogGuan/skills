That’s a great question — and it highlights the difference between  **alpha quality**  and  **portfolio value** .

Personally, I’d prioritize a  **moderate-performing alpha that adds genuine diversification**  to my portfolio over one with high standalone metrics but strong correlation to existing production signals. Here’s why:

1️⃣  **Portfolio Construction Is About Balance, Not Brilliance**

- Even an alpha with lower Sharpe (say 3.0–4.0 range) can be incredibly valuable if its  **production correlation**  with existing alphas is low (<0.2).
- A high-performing alpha with 0.54 correlation may look strong individually, but it’s likely  **capturing similar risk premia**  or behavioral structures as existing signals. In a combo, that redundancy reduces incremental impact.

2️⃣  **Diversification Amplifies Portfolio Sharpe Nonlinearly**

- The marginal benefit of adding an uncorrelated alpha often  **exceeds**  that of another high-performance but correlated one.
- Remember, overall portfolio Sharpe improves as √(1–ρ²) — meaning each independent idea adds exponential stability and persistence.

3️⃣  **OS/Production Robustness Matters More Than In-Sample Fitness**

- A high IS alpha may not hold up in production unless it adds new structure.
- A diversified alpha, even with modest Sharpe, tends to  **sustain its contribution**  across OS periods and regime shifts.

So in your case — given your alpha has  **average IS metrics (Sharpe 7.66, Fitness 6.22, Returns 17.4%)**  but a  **Prod Corr ≈ 0.54** , I’d treat it as a good signal candidate  **only if**  your existing portfolio isn’t already dense with similar exposures. Otherwise, I’d lean toward signals that may have  **lower IS performance**  but exhibit  **unique structure and orthogonality** .

Chào bạn. Tất cả các alpha đều hướng tới mục đích có thể được sử dụng. Nếu các alpha giống nhau thì team brain sẽ không chọn lại. Cho nên bạn hãy nộp các alpha có prod corr càng thấp càng tốt nhé.

The diversification is more valued, if you have high prod corr but sharpe is greater than 10% then you should submit it. diversification is valued because firm doesn't want to put all of its money on few instruments.You probably know about that saying "DON'T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN A SINGLE BASKET"

i think it depends... if the existed alphas with high correlation with the first one have Sharpe and fitness < 2, for example, then definitely the first one is more valuable

Personally, I find it harder to create low-correlated alphas than high-performing ones. So I usually go for low-corr.

While the spectacular performance of Example 1 is tempting, I would prioritize  **Example 2**  in almost all practical scenarios.

A prod correlation of 0.79 indicates the alpha is likely a variant of strategies already in your portfolio, offering little new "edge." Its high performance is probably redundant.

Example 2, with its significantly lower correlation (0.54), provides genuine, uncorrelated returns. In a large portfolio, the diversification benefit of Example 2 is more valuable and sustainable. It reduces overall risk and volatility, making the combined portfolio's Sharpe ratio more robust than one built on highly correlated, high-performing alphas.

Diversification is the only true "free lunch" in finance.

I would  **prioritize the moderate-performing alpha that adds genuine diversification** .

A high standalone alpha with high prod correlation often looks impressive in isolation, but in a portfolio context it mostly  **repackages existing risk** . It boosts redundancy, not robustness. When regimes shift, highly correlated signals tend to fail together.

Diversifying alphas, even with moderate standalone performance,  **improve the portfolio’s risk-adjusted return** , reduce drawdowns, and stabilize performance across market conditions. In the long run,  **portfolio IC and Sharpe matter more than individual alpha IC** .

In short:
👉 Strong alone is good.
👉 Different is powerful.
👉  **Uncorrelated strength is unbeatable.**

I think it really depends on the quality of the existing alphas. If the ones that are highly correlated with your first alpha all have Sharpe and fitness below, say, 2, then your first alpha is clearly the more valuable contribution. In that case, even with high correlation, it still adds stronger predictive power and would be the preferred signal to submit.
