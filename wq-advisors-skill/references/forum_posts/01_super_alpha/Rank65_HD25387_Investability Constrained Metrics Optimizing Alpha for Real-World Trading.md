You're absolutely right—strong backtest performance doesn't guarantee real-world profitability, especially when investability constraints are ignored. Liquidity, turnover, and scalability are critical for ensuring an alpha can be executed effectively.My Approach to Investability Constraints in Alpha Research✔Liquidity-Aware Ranking– Instead of ranking stocks purely on raw alpha scores, I integrate liquidity filters (e.g.,median daily volume,bid-ask spreads) to ensure tradability.✔Turnover Optimization– To control excessive trading, I usedecay-adjusted alphas, reducing signals that fluctuate too frequently. This helps smooth portfolio rebalancing and lowers costs.✔Market Impact Modeling– Incorporating slippage estimates and impact cost functions prevents unrealistic position sizing. I sometimes useVolume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) constraintsfor execution planning.✔Scalability Testing– Running simulations on different portfolio sizes helps determine if an alpha scales well or suffers from liquidity bottlenecks.Alternative Approaches to Enhance Alpha Execution✅Dynamic Liquidity Thresholds– Instead of fixed volume constraints, dynamically adjusting liquidity requirements based on market conditions improves adaptability.✅Adaptive Holding Periods– Extending holding times for low-liquidity stocks reduces slippage without significantly impacting returns.✅Factor-Neutralizing Investability Constraints– If liquidity constraints introduce unintended biases (e.g., market cap tilt), adjusting weights accordingly helps maintain signal integrity.The Bigger PictureAs competition in quant trading grows,execution-aware alphaswill be the real differentiator. Those who balancepredictive power with real-world feasibilitywill have the edge.Are you currently applying liquidity-aware filtering in your alpha selection process? Would love to hear your thoughts on balancing alpha strength with tradability.

### 评论 #39 (作者: KS69567, 时间: 1年前)

Keeping performance constant when liquidity is limited is essential for alpha methods to be successful.  Robustness may be evaluated by contrasting all-universe performance with a portfolio that has been screened for liquidity.  Strategies that reduce liquidity exposure while maintaining alpha efficiency include reducing turnover, using liquidity-aware ranking, and keeping an eye on market effect.  Adopting selection criteria based on turnover-adjusted IC and liquidity profiles guarantees that workable plans are provided.  Furthermore, avoiding illiquid assets by employing a whitelist of high-liquidity equities ensures steady and implementable strategies in markets such as ASI and GLB.  By using a balanced approach, the risks associated with illiquidity are reduced and performance is maximised.

DK20528Great points! Liquidity-weighted ranking is definitely helpful for smoother execution without losing too much signal. I've also experimented with turnover smoothing usingts_delta_limitto maintain signal integrity while reducing trading costs. For scalability, I typically simulate across different AUM tiers to observe degradation patterns. In live trading, these constraints often need dynamic rebalancing rules. Have you tried combining liquidity tiers with adaptive turnover control? Curious to hear your approach!
