Abstract:

We find consistent value and momentum return premia across eight diverse markets and asset classes, and a strong common factor structure among their returns. Value and momentum return correlate more strongly across asset classes than passive exposures to the asset classes, but value and momentum are negatively correlated with each other, both within and across asset classes. Our results indicate the presence of common global risks that we characterize with a three-factor model. Global funding liquidity risk is a partial source of these patterns, which are identifiable only when examining value and momentum jointly across markets. Our findings present a challenge to existing behavioral, institutional, and rational asset pricing theories that largely focus on U.S. equities

Thank you for your sharing, the paper is useful.

However from my experience, I think that in WQBrain reversal idea is more easily to brainstorm and building alpha, I think that's nature of market that we want to buy a stock when it drawdown than follow momentum. Can you share some tip to apply momentum idea to alpha in websim (eg: region, universe, some technique?)

This paper  offers a groundbreaking contribution to the asset pricing and portfolio management literature. By examining the pervasive nature of value and momentum effects across different asset classes, geographies, and markets, the authors convincingly argue that these phenomena are not confined to equities but are universal.

Their findings challenge the traditional notion that value and momentum are anomalies limited to specific markets or periods. Instead, the study highlights their systematic nature and suggests that these strategies may be rooted in deeper behavioral or risk-based explanations. The empirical approach is rigorous, with an impressive dataset spanning multiple decades and asset classes, including stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities.

Key strengths of the paper include:

1. **Cross-Asset Analysis:**  The authors’ ability to demonstrate consistency in value and momentum effects across diverse asset classes strengthens the robustness of their findings.
2. **Behavioral and Risk Explanations:**  The discussion of potential drivers—such as overreaction, underreaction, and risk-based explanations—provides a balanced view that invites further exploration.
3. **Portfolio Implications:**  The analysis of how value and momentum strategies interact in a diversified portfolio context is highly relevant for practitioners.

However, there are areas that could benefit from additional discussion:

1. **Market Efficiency:**  The authors touch on the efficiency implications of their findings, but a deeper dive into whether markets can remain inefficient despite the ubiquity of these effects would be valuable.
2. **Implementation Challenges:**  Transaction costs, liquidity constraints, and scalability issues for value and momentum strategies in less liquid markets warrant further examination.
3. **Out-of-Sample Testing:**  As financial markets evolve, exploring how these strategies perform in more recent, potentially algorithm-driven markets would enhance the paper’s applicability.

### Questions Regarding the Paper:

1. **Consistency Across Asset Classes:**  Did the magnitude of the value and momentum effects differ significantly across asset classes (e.g., equities vs. commodities)? Are there any asset classes where these effects are weaker or absent?
2. **Time-Period Sensitivity:**  How stable are the value and momentum effects over time? Have they diminished in more recent years due to increased awareness and exploitation by institutional investors?
3. **Behavioral vs. Risk-Based Explanations:**  The paper discusses both behavioral and risk-based explanations for value and momentum. Do the authors lean toward one explanation as being more plausible, or is the evidence equally split?
4. **Interactions Between Value and Momentum:**  The paper highlights the potential benefits of combining value and momentum strategies. Are there specific conditions or market environments where one strategy consistently outperforms the other?
5. **Data Coverage and Limitations:**  How comprehensive was the dataset used, particularly for non-equity asset classes? Were there any limitations in the data that could bias the results?
6. **Practical Applications:**  What insights does the paper provide for constructing real-world portfolios that balance exposure to value and momentum? How sensitive are the strategies to transaction costs and other implementation frictions?
7. **Impact of Market Microstructure:**  Did the study account for the impact of market microstructure changes, such as the rise of algorithmic trading or changes in liquidity, on value and momentum strategies?

Would you like further assistance with summarizing, critiquing, or exploring specific aspects of the paper?

**Hey, regarding applying momentum idea to alpha in websim, here are some tips. First, when choosing the region, focus on those with higher trading volumes and liquidity like major stock exchanges. For universe, pick stocks from sectors that historically show strong momentum responses. Technique-wise, you can use a combination of short-term and long-term momentum indicators to capture different trends. Also, consider adjusting the weights based on volatility. Hope these can help you build better alphas.**

Here's a concise take on how to apply momentum ideas to alpha in websim:

1. **Region Selection** : Opt for regions with higher trading volumes and liquidity, such as major stock exchanges, to capture strong momentum effects.
2. **Universe Filtering** : Choose stocks from sectors that have historically demonstrated significant momentum responses.
3. **Momentum Indicators** : Utilize a mix of short-term and long-term momentum indicators to identify trends across different time frames.
4. **Weight Adjustment** : Consider adjusting the weights of your alpha strategy based on volatility to manage risk effectively.

Hey, the paper shows consistent value and momentum return premia across different markets and asset classes. The negative correlation between value and momentum is interesting. When it comes to using these in Brain platform, for value, we can explore fundamental data like fnd23_intfv_value. For momentum, mdl57_momentum could be handy. Also, don't forget to analyze returns data. Combine them properly in your quant strategies and test via backtesting.

[DK20528](/hc/en-us/profiles/24602396283031-DK20528)  The study likely examines the influence of market microstructure changes, such as the rise of algorithmic trading and shifts in liquidity, on the performance of value and momentum strategies. These factors can significantly alter trading costs, execution speed, and market efficiency, potentially impacting the profitability and risk-adjusted returns of these strategies. Addressing such variables would provide a more nuanced understanding of how evolving trading environments influence the effectiveness of traditional investment approaches. I hope it helps.

The study "Value and Momentum Everywhere" identifies consistent return premia for value and momentum strategies across eight diverse markets and asset classes, revealing a strong common factor structure among their returns. Notably, value and momentum returns exhibit higher correlation across asset classes compared to passive exposures, yet maintain a negative correlation with each other both within and across these classes. The research introduces a three-factor model to characterize these global risks, suggesting that global funding liquidity risk partially explains these patterns. These findings challenge existing asset pricing theories that predominantly focus on U.S. equities.

This study identifies consistent value and momentum return premia across eight markets and asset classes, with a shared factor structure in their returns. While value and momentum correlate strongly within asset classes, they are negatively correlated with each other. The findings suggest a global risk factor, characterized by a three-factor model, partly driven by global funding liquidity risk. This challenges traditional asset pricing theories that focus predominantly on U.S. equities.
