With the recent update to Genius, my CSAP dropped, but I would like to know the best way to move it up and maintain high values of it.

Any ideas or suggestions are highly appreciated!

A shift in CSAP—especially toward a less negative value—often indicates a change in relative performance of your selected alphas under the updated Genius evaluation framework. This could be due to recent changes in the simulation environment, parameter updates, or changes in how robustness and stability are weighted. Sometimes, a less negative CSAP means that your alphas are now performing better relative to the benchmark or are less correlated with underperforming signals. To improve and maintain higher CSAP values, consider regularly reviewing your alpha set for redundancy, correlation spikes, and sensitivity to market regime changes. Diversifying across horizons, operator types, and universes can help cushion against performance swings. Monitoring turnover and ensuring your alphas are cost-efficient in execution will also contribute to a more stable CSAP. Running periodic out-of-sample validation with the latest Genius settings can reveal which alphas are truly robust in the updated environment.

Thank you for sharing your experience with the recent CSAP change. It’s always helpful when members openly discuss performance shifts following Genius updates, because it allows the community to compare observations and identify patterns. I appreciate that you not only mentioned the drop but also expressed a desire to improve and sustain higher CSAP values—this kind of forward-looking approach benefits everyone reading. Your post is a great reminder that the Genius environment evolves, and strategies must adapt alongside it. By raising this topic, you’re encouraging others to share practical ideas, such as diversification, turnover management, and robustness checks, which can help all of us navigate future changes more effectively.

The simplest approach:  **control turnover** .
The common approach:  **create clean Alphas**  and focus on  **quality over quantity** .
That’s the only way to save your CSAP (Combined Selected Alpha Performance). (jzc

A drop in CSAP to a less negative value often indicates a slight improvement in the combined alpha performance, though it’s still not positive. Causes may include dataset updates or Genius algorithm changes, which adjust weights on weaker alphas or alter interaction effects. To improve, review and remove low-performing alphas, increase the share of strong performers, and optimize allocation to reduce correlation while improving robustness.

Sometimes a “less negative” CSAP can actually be a sign that your weaker alphas are hurting less than before — either due to market shifts or Genius updates that reduce their drag.
One thing that’s worked for me is to treat every CSAP drop (even a small one) as a signal to audit my selection:

- Check OS stability for each alpha in the current set
- Remove or replace those with rising correlation to underperformers
- Blend in a few uncorrelated, high-Sharpe ideas from different datasets or horizons
  Over time, this keeps the portfolio healthier and cushions CSAP swings during Genius updates

The simplest approach is to control turnover, while a common best practice is to build clean Alphas and prioritize quality over quantity. To improve performance, regularly review and remove underperforming Alphas, increase the proportion of strong performers, and optimize allocations to reduce correlation and enhance robustness.

A drop in Combined Selected Alpha Performance (CSAP) after a Genius update often means the selection set or weight distribution in production has shifted, affecting how your alphas contribute. To raise and sustain CSAP, focus on building alphas with strong out-of-sample stability, low production correlation, and coverage in underrepresented universes. Diversifying time horizons and targeting unique data fields can help your alphas remain relevant through future updates. It’s also worth monitoring which universes and styles are gaining weight in the current selection, then designing signals that complement rather than duplicate them. Keep an eye on turnover and robustness scores as well, since highly stable and orthogonal alphas tend to survive production changes better. Periodic review of your submission mix — retiring consistently low-CSAP alphas and replacing them with fresher, unique designs — can help maintain a strong CSAP over time.
