am not sure but its better to focus on your returns,drawdown,margin,turnover, fitness  and sharp

alpha delay 0 will still be counted towards alpha performance, in addition, because of the nature of delay 0, alpha may trade a lot, so you should consider other metrics like Turnover and 2Y - sharpe to evaluate the effectiveness of alpha delay 0.

A momentum alpha might perform well with a 3-day price difference, but combining 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day delays in a smoothed or ensemble form could make it more stable across regimes.

Yes, the type of delay absolutely affects performance! Delay 0 alphas are harder because they rely on information available immediately, not at the next day's open or later.

I believe that the type of delay used can indeed affect both the selection and combination of alphas. In particular, Delay-Zero (D0) alphas are often much more challenging to build, resulting in a smaller pool of available signals. Consequently, this lower number tends to reduce production correlation, which can help improve the effectiveness of combining and selecting alphas. Moreover, developing D0 alphas is also an important approach to filling the alpha pyramid, which is highly beneficial for Genius portfolios. Additionally, D0 alphas often receive higher multipliers compared to standard D1 alphas, providing greater opportunities to generate higher earnings. Therefore, although building D0 alphas is more difficult, it offers significant advantages in both strategy diversification and potential profitability. I would be very interested to hear more insights from others who have experience optimizing alpha combinations across different delay structures.

Yes, the type of delay used in alpha design significantly affects both Selected and Combined performance metrics. Delay 0 (D0) alphas, which act on the same-day information, are more sensitive to microstructural noise and generally require more sophisticated modeling to be effective. These alphas often have higher turnover and lower signal stability, making them more difficult to optimize. However, when executed correctly, D0 alphas can bring substantial benefits—most notably, they contribute to signal diversification due to their typically lower correlation with other alphas. This can enhance the overall robustness of an alpha portfolio and improve Combined performance. Additionally, D0 alphas often qualify for higher multipliers and contribute uniquely to Genius scoring structures, including pyramid development. It’s crucial to monitor complementary metrics like 2Y-Sharpe, Drawdown, and Margin, as well as simulation efficiency, when evaluating the effectiveness of delay-based alpha structures.

The type of delay definitely plays a crucial role in alpha performance. Delay Zero alphas are particularly challenging because they rely on immediate information, which limits the available signal but reduces correlation with other alphas. This can actually be an advantage when combining alphas, as it helps diversify and improve overall portfolio robustness. Also, because Delay Zero alphas tend to trade more frequently, metrics like turnover and multi-year Sharpe ratios become essential for evaluation. I agree that developing strong D0 alphas can significantly enhance the alpha pyramid and provide higher multiplier benefits, making them a key focus for advanced quantitative strategies. Would love to hear more experiences from others about how they balance these factors in practice!

Delay Zero (D0) alphas present a unique challenge in alpha construction, primarily because they must act on information available  **immediately at the point of signal generation**  — without benefit of overnight gaps or lag-based smoothing. This increases sensitivity to market microstructure noise and often results in  **higher turnover** ,  **lower stability** , and  **greater simulation costs** . However, when built effectively, D0 alphas are extremely valuable due to their typically  **low correlation with delay-based (D1/D2) alphas** , making them ideal candidates for improving  **diversity in Super Alpha**  construction. For evaluation, it’s important to look beyond just Sharpe — metrics like  **2Y Sharpe** ,  **drawdown** ,  **turnover** , and  **margin utilization**  offer a more holistic view of D0 viability. Smart consultants often develop D0 alphas in complementary styles (e.g., short-term reversal, intraday volatility) to maximize robustness across regimes.
