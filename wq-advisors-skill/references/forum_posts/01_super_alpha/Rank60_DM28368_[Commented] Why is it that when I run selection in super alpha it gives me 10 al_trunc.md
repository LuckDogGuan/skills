Hi  [JS35015](/hc/en-us/profiles/25681312737175-JS35015) ,

I had faced a similar issue some time back. What solved it for me was clearing browser cache, logging out and back in after some time. You can also contact support if the issue persists. Thanks.

You might want to check your network connection or see if running too many simulation tabs at once is causing your system to lag. Closing some tabs and retrying could help resolve the issue.

Effectively matching operators is crucial for enhancing alpha performance, as it determines how signals are extracted, processed, and aligned with market behavior. Time-series operators capture both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Combining smoothing functions like  `ts_mean`  with difference operators such as  `ts_delta`  helps track price changes over different horizons. Cross-sectional operators, like  `group_rank`  and  `group_zscore` , compare assets within sectors or industries, allowing for the identification of relative strength or mean reversion opportunities. Blending momentum and reversion strategies helps balance risk and improves signal stability. Using smoothing methods, like  `ts_decay_linear` , reduces noise, while  `ts_winsorize`  controls outliers to prevent extreme values from distorting results. Applying  `group_neutralize`  corrects for sector biases, ensuring a more balanced alpha. Managing turnover with tools like  `ts_target_tvr_delta_limit`  ensures signals are both efficient and tradable. Carefully combining these techniques can produce more robust alphas with improved predictive accuracy and better real-world execution.

I have encountered this case. It could be because the alpha you selected has simulated for too long or because the dataset has been renamed.

Just raise a ticket with your selection to tech team by clicking submit a request. I think it is just a uncommon problem.
If the problem keep bothering you after simply re-login, you should provide more detail about your problem.(maybe you just mistake selection limit setting as selection number)

It sounds like there might be a discrepancy between your selection and simulation settings. Please double-check both—the selection output and your simulation configuration—to ensure consistency. Note that alphas with delay 0 behave differently from those with delay 1, and they cannot be selected together in the same group.

Since you selecting alphas from your own pool you need at least 10 alphas in that region to create that super alpha. In my understanding

It seems like there might be a discrepancy between the selection and simulation processes. One possibility is that some alphas are being filtered out due to constraints such as turnover, correlation, or missing data. Another reason could be that certain alphas fail validation checks during simulation. You may want to check if all selected alphas meet the necessary requirements for simulation. Additionally, reviewing the logs or error messages could provide more insights. Have you tried adjusting selection criteria or re-running the process to see if the issue persists?

### 评论 #12 (作者: DD24306, 时间: 1年前)

It sounds like you're running into an issue where the selection step gives you 10 alphas, but when you try to simulate them, you get the error stating that at least 10 alphas should be present.

### 评论 #13 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 1年前)

This issue often happens because although the Super Alpha selection shows 10 alphas, some of them might fail during the simulation due to low production coverage, NaN values, or zero signals across certain dates. The platform requires a minimum of 10 valid and fully functional alphas after filtering out those that fail production or coverage checks. When the system simulates, it automatically removes weak or invalid alphas, which might reduce the total number below 10, triggering the error.

To avoid this, you should select more than 10 alphas—ideally 12 to 15 strong and diversified ones with high coverage and stable performance. Additionally, review factor production status, use visualization tools to detect any weak alphas early, and double-check turnover to ensure efficiency. This way, your Super Alpha will pass simulation smoothly and deliver more stable results. Good luck refining your Super Alpha—hope you achieve great scores!

I don't know how you set up selection and combo in super alpha and what level of genius you are. But you can crawl all your alpha, to make sure you have enough normal alpha to make super alpha.

It sounds like you are dealing with a persistent issue where the selection process consistently identifies 10 alphas. I’ve run into a similar problem before, and a simple yet effective fix for me was clearing the browser cache and logging out for a while before signing back in. If that doesn’t resolve it, checking for any platform-side limitations or refreshing your session in an incognito window might help.

### 评论 #17 (作者: AB39149, 时间: 1年前)

it could be due to the alpha being simulated for an extended period, which may lead to session timeouts or outdated simulation data.It’s also possible that system updates or changes in data availability have affected the simulation environment.

To improve Alpha performance,  **operator selection and matching**  are critical.  **Time-series operators**  (e.g.,  *ts_mean* ,  *ts_delta* ) track trends, while  **cross-sectional operators**  ( *group_rank* ,  *group_zscore* ) compare assets within sectors.  **Blending momentum and mean reversion**  balances risk, and  **smoothing methods**  ( *ts_decay_linear* ,  *ts_winsorize* ) reduce noise.  **Turnover management**  using  *ts_target_tvr_delta_limit*  enhances tradability. Properly integrating these ensures more stable, efficient, and predictive Alphas.

Have you checked whether filtering conditions or neutralization steps are removing Alphas post-selection?

You can increase the selection number to 12/13/14 and try again. It might work then. Alternatively, you can raise a ticket for the issue.

Hi  [JS35015](/hc/en-us/profiles/25681312737175-JS35015) ,

This issue may arise due to selection settings, dataset inconsistencies, or prolonged simulations. Checking settings, clearing cache, and verifying selection limits can help resolve it. If the issue persists, contacting support with detailed information is advisable.

### 评论 #24 (作者: AM32686, 时间: 1年前)

It sounds like there might be a discrepancy between the selection and simulation stages. A few things to check:
1️⃣  **Alpha Filtering**  – Ensure none of the selected Alphas are being filtered out due to missing data or failing validation during simulation.
2️⃣  **Lookback Periods**  – Some Alphas might not have enough historical data to simulate properly. Try extending the lookback window.
3️⃣  **Constraints or Grouping Rules**  – If your Super Alpha applies constraints (like factor exposure limits), some Alphas might get excluded dynamically.
Have you checked the logs for specific Alpha exclusions? Let’s troubleshoot this together!

Effectively matching operators enhances alpha performance by refining signal extraction and alignment with market behavior. Time-series operators capture trends and fluctuations, while cross-sectional operators compare assets within sectors to identify opportunities. Combining momentum and reversion strategies balances risk and stabilizes signals. Smoothing methods like  `ts_decay_linear`  reduce noise, and  `ts_winsorize`  controls outliers.  `group_neutralize`  corrects sector biases, ensuring balanced alphas. Managing turnover with  `ts_target_tvr_delta_limit`  enhances tradability. A well-structured combination of these techniques leads to more robust, accurate, and executable alphas.

This usually happens when your selection expression technically selects 10 alphas, but after pre-processing or data filtering, fewer than 10 valid alphas remain during simulation. Here's how to fix it:

- Make sure all selected alphas have valid stats and production readiness.
- Avoid using overly strict filters in your selection expression (e.g., turnover < 0.05 && operator_count < 10).
- Try relaxing the filter or increasing the number of eligible alphas to ensure you always get more than 10.
- Also, double-check if any alphas are inactive or expired, which might silently be excluded.
- Good practice: select at least 12–15 alphas to prevent simulation failure due to cutoff

There might be a mismatch between your selection and simulation settings. Double-check both—the selection output and your simulation configuration—to make sure they align. Keep in mind that alphas with  **delay 0**  behave differently from those with  **delay 1** , and they can’t be selected together in the same group.

### 评论 #35 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 1年前)

The error indicating that “at least 10 alphas should be there” despite seeing 10 alphas in selection often stems from a mismatch between the selected alphas and those actually enabled or valid in the simulation environment. Sometimes, alphas might be filtered out during preprocessing or fail internal validation checks, resulting in fewer usable alphas than expected. Another cause could be synchronization delays between selection and simulation modules, or configuration settings requiring more than 10 alphas due to overlap or correlation constraints. Double-checking alpha statuses, filtering criteria, and simulation settings usually resolves this issue.
