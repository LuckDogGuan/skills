Generally, keeping the information intact and having a lower turnover means you will need to purify the information source. There is no one-for-all answer for different data fields. You will need to find ways to clean out the "noise" from your ideal signal target.

Hi, usually decreasing turnover will also lead to decreasing sharpe. You can use vector neut or regression neut functions to neutralize the risk factors, some factors will help to decrease turnover and increase sharpe

I asked about the same problem and received a response from a Brain team member:

**Hi all,**

Structurally, the problem may stem from three sources:

1. **The idea is good, but the Alpha technical construction is insufficient.**
   In this case, try the method mentioned above, along with the following additional techniques:
   - Include in your template relevant data-handling practices to ensure coverage, limit outliers, and smooth data. Missing initial and extra  `ts_backfill`  can significantly reduce Alpha value and create unnecessary turnover.
   - Use methods like  **clamp** ,  **winsorize** , or  **truncate**  to remove meaningless outliers. Ranking the data or applying  **decay**  and  **mean**  beforehand may also reduce turnover while preserving Sharpe ratio.
   - These techniques can be applied both before and after the main Alpha signal construction. For example, use  `ts_backfill`  and rank the raw data from the beginning.
   - Common methods include  **trade_when** ,  **decay** ,  **hump** ,  **ts_target_tvr_delta_limit** , and  **ts_target_tvr_hump** .
   - I personally recommend standardizing or scaling the signal first (using  **rank** ,  **quantile** ,  **scale_down** , or  **group_normalize** , etc.) before applying the above operators. Also, limit the operators' arguments to avoid excessive absolute values.
2. **The Alpha technical construction is sufficient to capture the idea, but the idea itself is insufficient to achieve the highest Sharpe without excessive turnover.**
   In this case, refine the idea and then adjust the technical construction accordingly.
   - To refine the idea, conduct thorough research on the economic behaviors underlying its profitability. You may discover specific settings, market conditions, or regimes where the idea performs best.
   - Direct your signal to these scenarios using conditional operators or creative weighting schemes.
3. **Both the technical construction and the idea are adequate, but the Alpha lacks sufficient capacity due to its inherent nature.**
   In this case, it’s best to drop it. You can learn more about Alpha capacity here:

Reducing turnover while maintaining a similar Sharpe ratio requires balancing the frequency of trades with the risk-return profile of your strategy. Here are several approaches that can help achieve this:

### 1.  **Increase Holding Period** :

- **Objective** : Reduce the frequency of trades by increasing the holding period for positions.
- **How** : One way to achieve this is by adding a time-based constraint to your strategy. For instance, only allow a stock to be traded after holding it for a certain period (e.g., 5 days, 10 days, etc.), regardless of the usual entry and exit conditions.
- **Impact** : By reducing how often you open and close positions, turnover will decrease. To ensure the Sharpe ratio remains stable, the strategy should still be profitable, with lower trading frequency allowing for a better balance between risk and return.

**Example** :

python

Copy code

`triggerTradeExp = (rank(volume) > 0.5)
AlphaExp = HelloWorld()
triggerExitExp = (rank(volume) <= 0.5) and (holding_period >= 5)  # Prevent early exits, holding for 5 days
trade_when(triggerTradeExp, AlphaExp, triggerExitExp)
`

### 2.  **Reduce the Sensitivity of Trade Signals** :

- **Objective** : Reduce the number of trades by making the strategy less sensitive to market fluctuations.
- **How** : For example, instead of triggering trades based on small price movements, you can introduce thresholds for price or volume changes that must be met before executing a trade.
- **Impact** : Fewer trades will be made because the conditions for entering and exiting positions are stricter. If you carefully manage your thresholds, it should allow you to maintain a similar Sharpe ratio by reducing the number of trades that aren't significant enough to make an impact on the risk-adjusted return.

**Example** :

python

Copy code

`triggerTradeExp = (rank(volume) > 0.5) and (abs(price_change) > 0.02)  # Only trade if price changes more than 2%
AlphaExp = HelloWorld()
triggerExitExp = (rank(volume) <= 0.5) and (abs(price_change) < 0.01)  # Exit only when price change is minimal
trade_when(triggerTradeExp, AlphaExp, triggerExitExp)
`

### 3.  **Limit Trade Size** :

- **Objective** : Reduce the impact of each trade by limiting the trade size.
- **How** : A way to reduce turnover is to scale back on the size of each trade. Even if the number of trades stays the same, smaller positions would result in less turnover. You can still maintain a similar Sharpe ratio by reducing the volatility of individual trades and better managing risk.
- **Impact** : Smaller trades lead to lower turnover, but they can still offer favorable risk-adjusted returns if the overall strategy remains sound.

**Example** :

python

Copy code

`triggerTradeExp = (rank(volume) > 0.5)
AlphaExp = HelloWorld()
trade_size = min(0.05, portfolio_value / current_price)  # Limit trade size to 5% of portfolio value
triggerExitExp = (rank(volume) <= 0.5)
trade_when(triggerTradeExp, AlphaExp, triggerExitExp, trade_size)
`

### 4.  **Focus on Higher Conviction Trades** :

- **Objective** : Only execute trades when there is stronger confidence in the outcome.
- **How** : One way to focus on higher conviction trades is by using a combination of multiple signals (e.g., technical, fundamental, sentiment, etc.) and only trading when all or most of them align. This will reduce the number of trades, focusing only on the most promising opportunities.
- **Impact** : This strategy reduces turnover by making fewer trades based on stronger signals, while maintaining the potential for high risk-adjusted returns.

**Example** :

python

Copy code

`triggerTradeExp = (rank(volume) > 0.5) and (sentiment_score > 0.7)  # Trade only if sentiment is strong
AlphaExp = HelloWorld()
triggerExitExp = (rank(volume) <= 0.5) or (sentiment_score < 0.3)  # Exit when sentiment weakens
trade_when(triggerTradeExp, AlphaExp, triggerExitExp)
`

### 5.  **Incorporate Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Conditions** :

- **Objective** : Avoid unnecessary exits and re-entries by setting a fixed stop-loss and take-profit.
- **How** : Implement stop-loss and take-profit limits based on price movement or volatility. This ensures that trades are exited only when significant price movements occur, reducing turnover from small fluctuations.
- **Impact** : By reducing the number of small, unnecessary trades, you can lower turnover while maintaining your target return. The Sharpe ratio could remain similar if you control risk through these mechanisms.

**Example** :

python

Copy code

`triggerTradeExp = (rank(volume) > 0.5)
AlphaExp = HelloWorld()
stop_loss = 0.05 # Exit if price drops 5% from entry
take_profit = 0.10 # Exit if price increases 10% from entry
triggerExitExp = (rank(volume) <= 0.5) or (price_change <= -stop_loss) or (price_change >= take_profit)
trade_when(triggerTradeExp, AlphaExp, triggerExitExp)
`

### 6.  **Optimize Portfolio Allocation** :

- **Objective** : Focus on fewer, larger positions rather than many small ones.
- **How** : Optimize the allocation of your capital across a smaller set of stocks, thereby reducing the number of trades and increasing the focus on more stable positions. This can be done using a portfolio optimization approach (such as mean-variance optimization or another risk-based method).
- **Impact** : By holding fewer, larger positions, turnover can be reduced while maintaining a similar risk-return profile, which should help keep the Sharpe ratio in the same range.

**Example** :

python

Copy code

`triggerTradeExp = (rank(volume) > 0.5)
AlphaExp = HelloWorld()
# Optimize portfolio allocation to limit the number of positions
top_n_stocks = 10 # Trade only the top 10 stocks
triggerExitExp = (rank(volume) <= 0.5)
trade_when(triggerTradeExp, AlphaExp, triggerExitExp, top_n_stocks)
`

### Conclusion:

To reduce turnover while maintaining a similar Sharpe ratio, you need to focus on strategies that decrease the frequency of trades without sacrificing the risk-adjusted returns. This can be achieved through a combination of increasing holding periods, tightening entry and exit conditions, controlling trade sizes, focusing on higher-conviction trades, and improving portfolio optimization. The key is to find a balance where trades are fewer but still strategically placed to deliver a similar risk-return profile.

Great insights from everyone! I’m wondering if using more fundamental data, like financial ratios or earnings growth, could help reduce turnover. If we focus more on these factors, could it help us be more confident in our trade signals and make fewer trades without hurting the Sharpe ratio?

[QG16026](/hc/en-us/profiles/22532757009175-QG16026)  Yes, fundamental data usually are easier to make low turnover signals with. However all data can be used to make alphas with low turnover and a decent sharpe in my experience! If you are going to try Fundamental data I would recommend starting with ASI region. Fairly simple alphas work well in it!

Textual Sentiment Alphas utilize sentiment analysis from various textual sources like news articles, social media, and financial reports to predict asset prices and generate trading signals in quantitative finance. These alphas are grounded in the idea that sentiment—whether positive, negative, or neutral—can influence market behavior and asset returns. However, they face challenges such as data quality issues, model complexity, market dynamics, and the ambiguity of natural language. To address these, practitioners should focus on domain-specific models, improve data preprocessing, employ advanced machine learning and NLP techniques, and carefully manage risk and model robustness.

**Hey, great discussion here!  [QG16026](/hc/en-us/profiles/22532757009175-QG16026) , using fundamental data like financial ratios or earnings growth can indeed help. As SK72105 said, they're often good for low turnover signals. But it depends on how you integrate them into your strategy. And 顾问 AM60509 (Rank 61)'s mention of ts_target_tvr_hump and trade_when is useful too. Experiment with different combos of these methods to find the best balance for reducing turnover while keeping Sharpe in range.**

### 评论 #18 (作者: AS16039, 时间: 1年前)

Reducing turnover while maintaining a high Sharpe ratio requires refining both the alpha signal and execution strategy. Key approaches include:

1. **Smoother Signal Construction**  – Use  **ts_backfill** ,  **clamp** ,  **winsorize** , and  **rank normalization**  to filter out noise while retaining alpha.
2. **Longer Holding Periods**  – Use  **trade_when**  and  **ts_target_tvr_hump**  to enforce minimum holding times.
3. **Risk-Neutralization**  – Apply  **vector neutralization**  or  **regression neutralization**  to remove excessive exposure to risk factors.

Here are the two ways I suggest:
1.Increase Forecast Autocorrelation: Higher autocorrelation in alpha signals leads to lower portfolio turnover. By incorporating lagged forecasts or using moving averages of alpha signals, you can stabilize the forecasts and reduce turnover.
2.Combine Multiple Alphas: Using a large number of alpha signals can help reduce turnover by diversifying the sources of returns. However, the benefit of adding more alphas diminishes once the number of clusters reaches a certain limit

### 评论 #21 (作者: MA97359, 时间: 1年前)

To reduce turnover while maintaining a similar Sharpe ratio, increase holding periods, tighten entry/exit conditions, limit trade size, focus on high-conviction trades, use stop-loss/take-profit rules, and optimize portfolio allocation. This ensures fewer but strategic trades, preserving risk-adjusted returns.

Reducing  **turnover**  while maintaining a  **decent Sharpe ratio**  is a common challenge in alpha development. One approach is to  **smooth the signal**  using moving averages or  **low-pass filters**  to remove short-term noise while retaining predictive power.  **Regularization techniques** , such as  **L1/L2 penalties** , can help reduce sensitivity to transient market fluctuations. Additionally,  **factor neutralization**  (via  **vector_neut**  or  **regression_neut** ) can stabilize the signal by removing unwanted risk exposures. You might also explore  **decay functions**  to control how fast positions adjust, preventing excessive rebalancing.

### 评论 #25 (作者: HQ17963, 时间: 1年前)

the  **ts_target_tvr_hump**  op is (almost) free magic. for example:

> ts_target_tvr_hump(signal, lambda_min=0, lambda_max=1, target_tvr=0.05)

you can try adjust the target_tvr value such as 0.01, 0.10. This reduces turnover with minimal impact on performance.
