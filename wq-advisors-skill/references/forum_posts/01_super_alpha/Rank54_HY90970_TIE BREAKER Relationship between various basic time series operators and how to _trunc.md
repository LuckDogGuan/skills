## 帖子正文

New consultants often find it difficult to use new operators as familiarity with them takes time. But, once you are familiar in using 'ts_zscore' you can increase your operator used by using other operators to simulate it exactly.

Here are 2 ways to achieve this:

ts_zscore(x,d)= (ts_av_diff(x,d)/ts_std_dev(x,d))*C(d)

ts_zscore(x,d)= (x-ts_mean(x,d))/ts_std_dev(x,d))*C(d)

So, by ts_zscore you should be able to increase your operator count further by 3 ts operators.

It should be helpful especially for GOLD consultants. This can be inspiration to find similar tye of relations between other operators and improve the tie breaker criteria.

Missing piece: Can you guess what is C(d)? , it is a function of days d. Let me know if you can not figure it out. I will add it in comments.

This method works because the  **z-score**  is a statistical measure used to standardize data points, making them comparable across different time periods or data sets. The formula essentially normalizes a time-series by removing its mean and scaling it by its standard deviation.

1. **Subtraction of Mean** : By subtracting the mean ( `ts_mean(x,d)` ) from each data point, you're centering the data around zero. This removes any bias caused by the absolute level of the data and ensures you’re focusing on how each value deviates from the average over time.
2. **Division by Standard Deviation** : Dividing by the standard deviation ( `ts_std_dev(x,d)` ) scales the data so that it is normalized, accounting for the spread or variability in the data. This ensures that data points with higher variability are not overemphasized.
3. **Adjustment by Constant ( `C(d)` )** : The constant  `C(d)`  might be used to scale or adjust the z-score based on a specific factor relevant to the analysis (e.g., a weighting factor or scaling for volatility).

Together, these steps transform the data into a standardized form, enabling you to compare values across time periods or datasets, and detect meaningful patterns or outliers. The three time-series operators ( `ts_av_diff` ,  `ts_std_dev` , and  `ts_mean` ) add complexity, but they enhance the precision and adaptability of this normalization process.

This post presents an interesting approach to increasing the number of time series operators used, particularly for new consultants aiming to optimize their tie-breaker score. By demonstrating how the  `ts_zscore`  operator can be decomposed into three separate operators ( `ts_av_diff` ,  `ts_std_dev` , and  `ts_mean` ), it provides a practical way to boost operator usage while deepening understanding of time series relationships.

One notable strength of this approach is its encouragement of analytical thinking—identifying similar operator relationships could lead to further optimizations and a better grasp of fundamental time series manipulations. However, the post could be enhanced by explicitly defining  `C(d)` , as its role in the equation remains unclear without additional context. Providing a numerical example or a small backtest could also help reinforce the effectiveness of this method in real-world applications.

Overall, this is a valuable insight for consultants, particularly those working toward GOLD status, and it sets the stage for more advanced explorations into time series transformations. 🚀

C(d) = 1 and power(d,0.5) are popular choice which is due to Central limit theorem. Scaling will have no impact when ts_zscore is the last component of alpha but matters as an intermediate component.

This is a great insight into increasing the "operators used" count by leveraging relationships between existing time series operators! Understanding how different operators can be combined or decomposed helps in both learning and optimizing alpha construction.

For the missing piece: C(d) is likely the square root of (d / (d - 1)). This adjustment accounts for the degrees of freedom correction in standard deviation calculations, ensuring consistency with ts_zscore’s behavior.

Great insights! Thanks for sharing. 😊

For  **C(d)** , I believe it is a normalization factor that depends on the time window  **d** . My best guess would be  **C(d) = sqrt((d-1)/d)** , which adjusts for the sample standard deviation.

This approach definitely helps in increasing the  **operator count**  efficiently. Have you explored similar relationships for other common operators like  **ts_decay_linear**  or  **ts_corr** ? That could further optimize tie-breaker strategies for GOLD consultants.

Looking forward to your thoughts! 🚀

This post presents an insightful strategy for increasing the number of time series operators used, particularly for new consultants aiming to optimize their tie-breaker scores. By breaking down the ts_zscore operator into ts_av_diff, ts_std_dev, and ts_mean, it not only enhances understanding but also increases the versatility of time series manipulations.

One of the strengths of this approach is its encouragement of analytical thinking—it highlights the relationships between operators, opening the door to further optimizations. Recognizing such patterns could help refine the application of other time series operators in future strategies.

However, the post would benefit from more clarity around C(d), as its role in the equation remains ambiguous without further context. A numerical example or backtest could provide real-world evidence of the method's effectiveness and improve its applicability.

This method seems like a solid step toward mastery for GOLD consultants. It would be fascinating to explore how this approach performs across different scenarios and datasets. Have you considered testing this method in varying market conditions or with other operator combinations?

To increase the "operators used" tie breaker for new consultants, understanding the relationships between time series operators is crucial. One example is how  `ts_zscore(x,d)`  can be expressed using other operators:  `(ts_av_diff(x,d) / ts_std_dev(x,d)) * C(d)`  or  `(x - ts_mean(x,d)) / ts_std_dev(x,d) * C(d)` . By leveraging these relationships, using  `ts_zscore`  effectively increases the operator count by three ( `ts_av_diff` ,  `ts_std_dev` , and  `ts_mean` ). This approach is particularly beneficial for GOLD consultants and can inspire similar derivations to enhance the tie breaker metric. A key question remains: What function does C(d) represent?

### 评论 #22 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 1年前)

The post introduces a creative approach for new consultants to increase the "operators used" tie breaker, leveraging basic time series operations. By utilizing ts_zscore and breaking it down into simpler components like ts_av_diff, ts_std_dev, and ts_mean, consultants can increase their operator count, which is a valuable strategy for those working within constrained tie-breaking scenarios. The suggestion to combine and simulate operations is a great way to enhance model sophistication without introducing entirely new operations, making it a smart and efficient approach. It's important to note that the function C(d), as suggested, is likely a factor that scales the result based on the number of days, providing a normalization or adjustment to account for varying time periods.

### 评论 #23 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 1年前)

This is a clever and practical insight—especially valuable for consultants aiming to maximize operator diversity for tie-breaker scoring. The relationship between  `ts_zscore` ,  `ts_mean` ,  `ts_std_dev` , and  `ts_av_diff`  demonstrates how composite understanding of operator mechanics can lead to higher operator usage without sacrificing signal integrity. Regarding the missing function C(d), I’d guess it could be a scaling factor like √(d / (d−1)) or something similar to standardize the z-score calculation based on window size. Would love to see a deeper dive into how similar decomposition can be applied to momentum-based operators like  `ts_delta`  or  `ts_decay_linear` . Great share!
