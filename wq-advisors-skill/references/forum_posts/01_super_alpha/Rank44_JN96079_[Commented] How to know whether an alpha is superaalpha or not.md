When you submit at least 100 Alphas in the aggregate (and which have not been decommissioned), then you will eligible to submit SuperAlphas in any universe or region. The 100 would also include Alphas submitted by the user before he/she was upgraded to consultant status.

To determine whether an  **alpha is a  *SuperAlpha***  or not, there are  **specific criteria and indicators**  you can rely on Public tie-break ranking(rank%),OS performance,Correlation with other Alphas,IS vs OS similarity,Alpha class or we can say that Alpha Complexity

You know it right at the time of simulating, super alphas have a separate simulation ui as compared to the regular alphas

When you submit 100 alphas, the WQ platform will unlock SuperAlpha for you, and it has separate tag and simulation.

When you send about 100 regular alphas and make sure those 100 alphas are not inactive, you will be able to open the superalpha sim feature. SA will be different from regular in that there will be 2 expressions: selection and combo, you will choose alpha to combine into a single super alpha based on the selection expression. The combo expression will allow you to combine the alpha pools after selecting to combine into 1 SA.

When you submit 100 alphas on the WQ platform, SuperAlpha unlocks with its own tag and simulation.

A Superalpha consistently delivers strong, stable returns, high Sharpe ratio, low correlation with others, and robustness across markets. It’s a reliable, valuable alpha linked to clear economic drivers.

When you submit 100 alphas, the WQ platform will unlock the Super Alpha feature for your account. Once unlocked, you can create and simulate alphas in the  Super Alpha section. These alphas have a separate tag and are simulated through a different pipeline compared to regular alphas. If your alpha performs well based on metrics like return, uniqueness, and stability, it may qualify as a  Super Alpha.

A SuperAlpha in the WorldQuant platform is essentially a composite alpha — an aggregation of multiple component alphas designed to work together, often to improve stability, diversification, and out-of-sample (OS) performance. You can usually identify a SuperAlpha by checking whether it’s built from a set of underlying alphas in the platform’s SuperAlpha creation interface. In the results view, a SuperAlpha will have metrics both for the combined entity and for each component alpha. Unlike regular alphas, which have a single mathematical expression, SuperAlphas are portfolios of signals with assigned weights. The template typically involves:

1. Selecting a set of low-correlated, high-quality alphas.
2. Assigning weights (equal or optimized) to each.
3. Optionally applying neutralization or turnover constraints at the portfolio level.
4. Testing both in-sample and out-of-sample before finalizing.
   If you see your alpha listed with editable components and combined metrics, it’s a SuperAlpha; if it’s a single expression without components, it’s a standard alpha.

Thanks for bringing this up — many consultants hear the term “SuperAlpha” but aren’t entirely sure how to identify or build one. Your question is a great starting point for clarifying that distinction and encouraging others to share their own templates and best practices. Understanding the difference between a standalone alpha and a composite SuperAlpha is important because the latter allows for more robust performance by combining multiple signals. I appreciate that you’re asking not only “what is it” but also about templates, since practical guidance on component selection, weighting, and testing can save a lot of trial-and-error for those new to the process.

A simple but effective template for building Super Alphas is to start by selecting 3–5 diverse regular alphas with solid IS/OS performance and low correlation, then normalize them with zscore or ts_rank so they are comparable. Combine them additively (add) or, where complementary, multiplicatively (mul or signed_power), and apply group_neutralize at the industry or country level to remove structural biases. Keep turnover and fitness in check by testing different decay or truncation settings, and use Component Activation to stress-test stability across IS and OS. For example, a starting structure could be  `group_neutralize(add(zscore(alpha1), zscore(alpha2), zscore(alpha3)), industry)`  and then refined with decay or power transforms.

Hey   [LB76673](/hc/en-us/profiles/17735208017303-LB76673) , with the structure you have given, isn't that a way to create a regular alpha, but just combining multiple alphas?

Creating a super alpha requires selecting at least 10 alphas and a combination expression to build the final super alpha. Could you please take a moment to provide a simple explanation?

I'm still learning, and I appreciate your concern in helping a member.

Thanks!
