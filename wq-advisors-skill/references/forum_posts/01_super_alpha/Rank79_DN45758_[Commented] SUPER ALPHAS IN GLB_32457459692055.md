Yes, the introduction of Super Alphas in the GLB (Global) region is a new and exciting development. Super Alphas are selected based on their exceptional performance across multiple metrics — especially  **high Sharpe** ,  **low turnover** ,  **strong after-cost performance** , and  **broad coverage** .

Here are some tips for developing GLB Super Alphas:

1. **Use Global Datasets** : Prioritize datasets that are available and reliable across multiple countries or regions.
2. **Optimize for Stability** : Use  `ts_mean` ,  `rank` , or  `zscore`  operators to reduce noise and increase consistency.
3. **Minimize Turnover** : Apply turnover-limiting operators like  `ts_delta_limit` ,  `tradewhen` , or  `ts_target_tvr_delta_limit` .
4. **Focus on Liquidity** : Ensure your alpha targets liquid stocks to avoid noise from illiquid names.
5. **Backtest across sub-universes** : Ensure your alpha performs well across various sub-universes within GLB.
6. **Regularize and Prune Features** : Avoid overfitting — keep the logic simple and generalizable.
7. **Benchmark against PowerPool** : Make sure your alpha outperforms existing PowerPool alphas in GLB region.

With the introduction of SuperAlphas in the GlB region, new opportunities arise to create powerful, diversified strategies. Key tips include:  **neutralizing by COUNTRY**  to ensure meaningful global comparisons, using the  **combo_a**  operator to combine diverse, uncorrelated alphas, and starting your tests on the  **TOP3000**  universe for faster iteration. Once confident, validate on  **MINVOL1M**  to confirm liquidity and scalability. Prioritize component alphas with sufficient  **OS data**  for robustness. For example, combining a tech-sector alpha from the US with a healthcare alpha from Europe via combo_a can enhance diversification. Following these steps will help build effective GlB SuperAlphas.

I was facing long run times in the GLB region, so I imagine that creating SuperAlphas here will definitely have humongous run times. But another gentleman suggested doing early testing on TOP3000 and then moving to MINVOL1M, and that seems like a must.

With SuperAlphas now live in the GLB region, focus on  `COUNTRY`  neutralization to ensure proper global alignment. Start prototyping in TOP3000 for speed, then validate in MINVOL1M. Use  `combo_a`  with diverse alphas across regions. Ensure components have strong OS data. Example: combine FX-neutral and sector-agnostic alphas for robustness.

One helpful tip: keep an eye on  *internal correlation*  between your component alphas using self_corr or innerCorr stats. Combining diverse alpha types (e.g., fundamental vs. price-based) reduces redundancy and boosts overall performance. Diversification isn’t just regional—it’s methodological too!

With SuperAlphas now available in the GLB region, it’s essential to adopt a workflow that balances efficiency and robustness. Neutralizing by COUNTRY is key to making meaningful comparisons across global markets, reducing regional biases. Using the  `combo_a`  operator to blend diverse, uncorrelated alphas—such as combining a tech alpha from North America with a healthcare alpha from Europe—can substantially enhance diversification and reduce signal correlation. Early testing on the TOP3000 universe accelerates iteration, while final validation on MINVOL1M ensures liquidity constraints and scalability are properly addressed. Prioritizing component alphas with strong OS data helps stress-test your signals under various market conditions, ultimately building more durable global strategies.

The launch of SuperAlphas in the GlB region opens exciting possibilities to build robust and diversified strategies. To maximize effectiveness, it’s crucial to neutralize by COUNTRY, ensuring meaningful comparisons across global markets. Using the combo_a operator allows you to merge diverse, uncorrelated alphas—like pairing a US tech-sector alpha with a European healthcare alpha—to boost overall diversification and stability. Given the long run times typical in the GlB universe, starting your tests on the TOP3000 universe can speed up iterations, while final validation on MINVOL1M ensures liquidity and scalability for real trading conditions. Always prioritize component alphas with ample out-of-sample (OS) data to guarantee robustness. These practical steps help streamline development and improve performance in global alpha construction. How do you manage the trade-off between testing speed and robustness when working with complex global strategies?

Thanks for sharing these valuable tips for building SuperAlphas in the GLB region! Highlighting the importance of COUNTRY neutralization and the use of  `combo_a`  to merge diverse alphas is especially helpful. I also found the advice to start testing on TOP3000 for quicker iterations—then validating on MINVOL1M for scalability and liquidity—very practical. These insights provide a clear and effective roadmap for developing robust, global SuperAlphas, and I’m excited to start applying them to improve my results.

Thank you so much for bringing up this topic about creating SuperAlphas in the Global (GLB) region. It’s really helpful to see someone take the initiative to gather tips and examples because transitioning from regional or domestic strategies to a global scale often introduces new challenges. Many consultants might not realize the added complexity with cross-country correlations, macro factors, and liquidity variations when designing these broader SuperAlphas. Your open call for practical advice creates a great opportunity for the community to exchange best practices and real-world learnings, which ultimately helps everyone level up their alpha design skills. I genuinely appreciate your proactive approach and I look forward to seeing everyone’s suggestions and maybe even contributing some working examples myself. Thank you again for sparking this collective learning moment!

Now that SuperAlphas are accessible in the GLB region, it's crucial to establish a workflow that prioritizes both effectiveness and reliability. Neutralizing by COUNTRY is fundamental for conducting valid cross-market comparisons and minimizing regional distortions. Leveraging combo operators to merge distinct, non-correlated alphas—for instance, pairing a technology-focused alpha from North America with a healthcare alpha from Europe—can significantly improve diversification while lowering signal interdependence.

Conducting preliminary tests within the TOP3000 universe enables faster refinement cycles, whereas final verification using MINVOL1M ensures that liquidity requirements and scaling potential are thoroughly evaluated. Focusing on component alphas that demonstrate solid out-of-sample (OS) performance allows you to rigorously test your signals across different market environments, leading to the development of more resilient global investment strategies.

Leveraging the  `combo_a`  operator enables you to combine uncorrelated signals—for example, blending a US tech alpha with a European healthcare alpha—to enhance stability and reduce overall risk.

Given the longer simulation times in GLB, it’s efficient to begin development using the  **TOP3000 universe**  for quicker iteration. Then, move to  **MINVOL1M**  for final testing to ensure liquidity and real-world scalability. Always favor component alphas with sufficient  **out-of-sample (OS) data** , as they’re more likely to hold up under production scrutiny.

Following this workflow balances efficiency with reliability and helps produce globally viable alphas.
—How do you strike a balance between rapid iteration and deep robustness in your global alpha development process?
