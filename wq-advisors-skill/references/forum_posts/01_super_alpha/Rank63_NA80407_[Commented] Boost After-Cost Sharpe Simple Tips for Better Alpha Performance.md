Improving after-cost performance is important for better alpha results. Here are some simple ways to increase the after-cost Sharpe ratio:

- **Reduce Turnover Spikes:**  Track both average and highest daily turnover. Use turnover charts to find spikes and smooth out big jumps.
- **Distribute Alpha Weights Well:**  Make sure alpha weights are spread across different market caps. Use charts to check if too much is in small-cap stocks.
- **Keep Good Coverage:**  Focus on covering a wide range, especially liquid stocks. Long and short positions should cover at least half the universe, with short positions not too high.
- **Check Different Stock Groups:**  Don’t just rely on the sub-universe Sharpe test. Use Universe dataset fields to create your own tests and ensure good performance across different stock groups.

Good points! I’d like to add a few more operators to improve After-cost Sharpe:

- **Optimize trade volume** : Avoid trading too large relative to liquidity by using  **ts_partial_corr, ts_decay_linear, ...**
- **Flexible turnover control** : Use a combination of  **trade_when, ts_target_tvr_delta_limit**  to keep turnover low without losing alpha signals.
- **Adjust alpha allocation based on liquidity** : Apply  **hump**  to avoid bias toward small-cap stocks, making alpha more sustainable.

You can reduce the alphas to single vectors (like how you described dimensionality reduction in machine learning) and calculate the cosine similarity between those vectors. This works well when alphas are represented as vectors or higher-dimensional data points, and you're interested in measuring the angle between the two vectors.

- **Kelly Criterion:**  Use the  **Kelly formula**  to determine the optimal bet size for each alpha.
- **Risk Parity Allocation:**  Distribute capital based on volatility-adjusted positions rather than equal-weighting.
- **Beta-Neutrality:**  Ensure that portfolio weights are beta-neutral to reduce systematic risk exposure.

If you choose the third parameter as "market" (for instance, in some financial data contexts), it could mean that you are using market capitalization or some similar financial metric as the weight for the stocks in each group. In this case, the weight would not be the original weight, but rather the market value that influences the mean.

**Watch Short Position Sizes** : Be cautious about taking too large short positions. While short positions can be useful for hedging or taking advantage of overvalued stocks, they can also be riskier, especially in volatile markets. Limit short exposure to a reasonable portion of your total portfolio.

Hi  [PP87148](/hc/en-us/profiles/11771952650775-PP87148) ,

Combined alpha performance refers to the Sharpe ratio of all your alphas. Combined selected alpha performance, on the other hand, refers to the Sharpe ratio of all the alphas you've selected within your submitted super alphas.

Initially, Brain did not factor in the costs associated with implementing your strategies, and Sharpe ratios were displayed without considering these costs. However, as mentioned in the webinar, they are now including after-costs in the combined and selected combined alpha performance calculations. Thus, the combined alpha performances you’ve seen are now the after-cost versions, which include the costs incurred when applying your strategies

### 评论 #22 (作者: QG16026, 时间: 1年前)

I fully support the strategies mentioned. Monitoring both average and peak turnover helps control turnover spikes, reducing transaction costs and increasing efficiency. Diversifying alpha weights across various market caps mitigates risk, particularly in small-cap stocks. Maintaining broad coverage of liquid stocks while limiting excessive short positions ensures a balanced and adaptable strategy.

---

### 评论 #23 (作者: TN74933, 时间: 1年前)

Hi, it is useful to also:

- Test alpha robustness in different volatility regimes to reduce sensitivity to market cycles.
- Implement adaptive weighting based on macro conditions (e.g., rate hikes, liquidity shifts).

Good luck!

### 评论 #30 (作者: KS69567, 时间: 1年前)

To optimize trade volume and turnover:

1. **Optimize Trade Volume** : Use methods like  `ts_partial_corr`  and  `ts_decay_linear`  to avoid trading too large relative to liquidity.
2. **Flexible Turnover Control** : Implement  `trade_when`  and  `ts_target_tvr_delta_limit`  to maintain low turnover while preserving alpha signals.
3. **Adjust Alpha Allocation** : Use the  `hump`  function to prevent bias toward small-cap stocks, ensuring more sustainable alpha.

These strategies balance liquidity, turnover, and alpha to create more efficient and sustainable trading.

### 评论 #31 (作者: KS69567, 时间: 1年前)

Incorporating alternative data and dynamically adjusting strategies are key to improving returns while keeping risk in check.

1. **Risk Parity** : Balance risk exposure across different assets or strategies, ensuring that no single position dominates the overall risk profile.
2. **Adaptive Risk Management** : Use dynamic risk models (e.g., volatility targeting) to adjust exposure based on changing market conditions and volatility.
3. **Diversification** : Extend your diversification beyond traditional assets—consider adding alternative assets or factors like commodities, real estate, or even cryptocurrencies to reduce overall risk.
4. **Machine Learning Models** : Use advanced ML techniques like reinforcement learning to adapt strategies in real time, optimizing both returns and risk.
5. **Transaction Cost Analysis** : Incorporate transaction costs and slippage into your models to better estimate net returns and avoid overestimating performance.

By continuously adapting to market conditions and integrating new data sources, you can further improve the risk-return tradeoff and boost your Sharpe ratio over time.

You’re correct that reducing alphas to single vectors, similar to dimensionality reduction in machine learning, and measuring the cosine similarity between those vectors is an effective method for understanding how similar two alphas are. This approach is particularly useful when working with alphas in higher-dimensional spaces and allows for evaluating the degree of alignment between their movements.

To improve alpha performance while managing transaction costs, consider the following techniques:

1. **Market Capitalization Weighting** : Instead of using the initial weight, you can weight stocks by their market cap or other financial metrics. This adjusts for the influence each stock has on the portfolio and helps mitigate the risk from smaller, illiquid stocks.
2. **Neutralization and Noise Reduction** : Use neutralization techniques across multiple factors and apply noise reduction methods like entropy filtering.
3. **Transaction Cost Modeling** : Factor in slippage, spreads, and market impact to refine real-world execution.

How do you typically model transaction costs when developing your alphas?
