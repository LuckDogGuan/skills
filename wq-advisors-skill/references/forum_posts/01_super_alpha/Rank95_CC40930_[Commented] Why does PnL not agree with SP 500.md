Hi, I tried simulating the equal-weighted S&P 500 by using the alpha expression "1" and TOP500 setting, no neutralization etc, with result below

As shown below, this looks different from the equal-weighted S&P 500 (orange line) as well as the usual cap-weighted S&P 500 (candles). Specifically, the low at Mar 2020 is higher than the low at Dec 2018. Any reason why?

Hi! Please check out this article on how universes are formed:  [What do the Universes mean: TOP3000, TOP2000, and TOP1000?](/hc/en-us/articles/5972014739607-What-do-the-Universes-mean-TOP3000-TOP2000-and-TOP1000)

Ah, so it is composed not only of S&P500 but also of NASDAQ etc?

### 评论 #3 (作者: AG20578, 时间: 2年前)

The TOP-N universes are comprised of N stocks of the region with the highest average dollar volume over the past 3 months

[AG20578](/hc/en-us/profiles/12243980162327-AG20578)  - What do you mean by the highest average dollar volume?

It seems like you're simulating an equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 using the alpha expression "1" with the  `TOP500`  setting. The observed difference in the lows (with the March 2020 low being higher than the December 2018 low) compared to the actual equal-weighted S&P 500 and the cap-weighted S&P 500 could be due to several factors related to the alpha expression, the simulation settings, or the underlying index construction. Here are some potential reasons for this discrepancy:

### 1.  **Alpha Expression ("1")**

- By setting the alpha expression to  `"1"` , you're effectively telling the system to treat all stocks equally, with no adjustments or filtering based on any fundamental or technical factors. However, this could lead to unintended biases in the selection of stocks, especially during periods of market stress.
- **Potential Impact** : In times of market volatility (like March 2020), stocks with higher volatility, lower liquidity, or more pronounced market reactions may not be selected in a truly equal-weighted fashion. This could explain why the low in March 2020 is higher than expected, as the simulation may be selecting a set of stocks that weren't as impacted by the market downturn, compared to what would occur in a real-world equal-weighted index.

### 2.  **TOP500 Universe**

- The  `TOP500`  setting restricts the universe to the top 500 stocks by market capitalization, which means you're only looking at large-cap stocks. This doesn't exactly mimic the true equal-weighted S&P 500, which includes all stocks, regardless of market cap.
- **Potential Impact** : During market stress events (like March 2020), large-cap stocks tend to be more stable or less volatile than mid- and small-cap stocks. If you're not including mid- or small-cap stocks in your simulation (due to the  `TOP500`  restriction), you could see less of the sharp drop typical of an equal-weighted index during a crisis.

### 3.  **Cap-Weighted Bias**

- The cap-weighted S&P 500 (represented by the candles in your graph) is heavily influenced by the largest companies in the index (e.g., Apple, Microsoft). During periods of market stress, these large-cap companies often experience less dramatic sell-offs than smaller stocks, as they tend to be perceived as "safer" or more resilient.
- **Potential Impact** : If your simulation uses only the largest 500 companies (with an equal-weighted approach), but doesn't account for mid and small-cap stocks, your simulated index could be more influenced by large-cap stocks’ relative stability during the downturns, resulting in a higher low in March 2020 compared to the true equal-weighted S&P 500.

### 4.  **Data Source and Adjustments**

- Sometimes, data discrepancies (such as adjustments for stock splits, dividends, or survivorship bias) can affect the results of a simulation. Ensure that your data source is correctly adjusted to account for such factors.
- **Potential Impact** : If your simulation data isn't adjusted for such events (like stock splits or dividends), the results could differ from the actual index performance, especially during periods of sharp market corrections.

### 5.  **Neutralization (or Lack Thereof)**

- While you mentioned no neutralization in your setup, some factors, such as industry exposure or sector biases, might still be influencing the stock selection and performance. Even without explicit neutralization, certain factors could inadvertently lead to sectoral or style biases, particularly during market stress periods.
- **Potential Impact** : The lack of neutralization could be causing your alpha to be more exposed to certain sectors (like technology or healthcare), which performed relatively well in 2020 compared to others (e.g., energy or financials). This could explain the higher low in March 2020.

### Summary of Possible Causes:

- **Universe Restriction** : The  `TOP500`  universe restricts your sample to only large-cap stocks, which tend to be less volatile during market crises.
- **Alpha Expression** : A simple "1" expression may lead to biases in stock selection, particularly in volatile periods when small-cap stocks or certain sectors experience larger declines.
- **Cap-Weighted Bias** : The cap-weighted bias of large-cap stocks could be influencing the result, as they are often more resilient during market downturns.
- **Data Adjustments** : Ensure that data used for your simulation is correctly adjusted for events like stock splits, dividends, and survivorship bias, which might affect the simulation outcome.
- **Neutralization** : Even without explicit neutralization, industry or sector biases might still be affecting the selection of stocks.

### Suggestions:

- **Expand the Universe** : Try using a broader universe or including mid- and small-cap stocks in your simulation to better replicate the equal-weighted S&P 500.
- **Refine Alpha Expression** : Consider modifying the alpha expression to better align with the characteristics of the equal-weighted S&P 500, or experiment with adding more neutralization factors (e.g., sector neutralization) to prevent bias.
- **Cross-Check Data** : Verify that your data is adjusted correctly and that no external factors are causing discrepancies in your results.

I hope these insights help you identify the cause of the discrepancy! Let me know if you need further clarification or additional suggestions.

**Hey,  [DK20528](/hc/en-us/profiles/24602396283031-DK20528)  really gave a comprehensive analysis there! I just wanna add that another thing to consider might be the rebalancing frequency. If it's different from how the actual S&P 500 is rebalanced, it could also contribute to the discrepancy. Maybe check that and adjust accordingly to get results closer to the real equal-weighted S&P 500.**

[IH10395](/hc/en-us/profiles/21540813213207-IH10395)  The BRAIN platform offers standard universes like TOP3000, TOP2000, and TOP1000, which include stocks with the highest average dollar volume over the past 3 months. For example, the TOP3000 universe consists of the 3000 most liquid stocks over the last three months, ensuring high liquidity in these universes.

The rebalancing could be different, or maybe the truncation caused some stocks to hit the weight allocation limit.

**Interesting observation!**

A few possible reasons for the discrepancy:

1. **Rebalancing Frequency:**
   - The simulated portfolio might be rebalanced more frequently than the actual equal-weighted S&P 500 index, leading to differences in performance, especially during volatile periods.
2. **Dividend Impact:**
   - Ensure that the simulation accounts for dividends. Equal-weighted indices typically include dividend reinvestments, which might not be reflected in your simulation.
3. **Data Differences:**
   - Check for discrepancies in the underlying data, such as stock universe composition, delisted stocks, or missing price adjustments (e.g., splits, corporate actions).
4. **Transaction Costs:**
   - If the simulation ignores transaction costs, this could lead to an overestimation of returns compared to the actual index.

Clarifying these factors should help align the simulation closer to the benchmark. Looking forward to hearing others' thoughts! 😊

The discrepancy you're observing between the simulated equal-weighted S&P 500 (using the alpha expression "1" and the TOP500 setting) and the actual equal-weighted or cap-weighted S&P 500 could be due to several factors.
