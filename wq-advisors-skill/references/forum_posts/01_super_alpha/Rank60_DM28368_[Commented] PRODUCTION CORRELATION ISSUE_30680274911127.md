### **Adjust the Universe or Features**

- **Different asset universe** : If the universe of assets you're selecting from has high correlations (for example, all stocks within a specific sector), consider expanding or diversifying your universe. Alternatively, you can focus on assets from different sectors or asset classes.
- ### **Correlation-Based Selection or Filtering**
  - **Filter correlated alphas** : Before combining multiple alpha signals into a super alpha, perform a correlation check and discard signals that are highly correlated (say, above 0.8 or 0.9). You can use tools like the  **correlation matrix**  or  **distance-based clustering**  to select uncorrelated alphas.

Hi  [DK20528](/hc/en-us/profiles/24602396283031-DK20528)  It's been a while!

I am also interested in understanding how to address the challenges posed by high production correlation when creating super alphas. This issue can significantly hinder the effectiveness of your strategy by introducing redundancy among signals.

Hii  AK40989,

Great to see you back! High production correlation is definitely a critical challenge when constructing Super Alphas. Redundant signals can dilute the effectiveness of a strategy and lead to unnecessary risk concentration. Have you explored methods like hierarchical clustering or PCA to diversify alpha components? Another approach could be using orthogonalization techniques to ensure each alpha contributes unique information. Would love to hear your thoughts on how you're tackling this!

If you're struggling with production correlation issues, try using a less explored dataset to develop alpha and experiment with different neutralization techniques for better performance.

You can choose your normal low prodcorr alphas or you can take low corr alphas from the system according to your genius level to create a low prodcorr super alpha

Production correlation is very common to majority of consultants this Is because of using same operators and datafields...what actually might make you stand out is by creating alphas on new universe and using new operators that have been introduced, and also minimize on using the mostly used datafields.

There are lots of great ideas in the thread for the 2024 SuperAlpha competition:

[https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/20847461940375-SuperAlpha-Competition-2024](https://support.worldquantbrain.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/20847461940375-SuperAlpha-Competition-2024)

I suspect there comes a point, however, where there are diminishing returns to new portfolio construction techniques and the emphasis needs to be more on expanding the alpha pool.

High production correlation can make a super alpha unsubmitable. Trying different combination techniques to adjust component alpha weights may help reduce correlation. Selecting uncorrelated or low-correlated alphas also lowers production correlation.

### 评论 #9 (作者: MK58212, 时间: 1年前)

I am also struggling to create Super Alphas from my own pool due to very high production correlation. Despite trying different weighting techniques and diversification methods, the correlation remains high, limiting the effectiveness of my combined strategy.

Has anyone faced a similar issue? What additional approaches or solutions would you recommend to reduce correlation and improve the overall performance of the Super Alpha? Any insights or alternative methods would be greatly appreciated!

In the same region you need alphas that are typically diverse in all aspects like Universe, Neutralization and dataset, your auto-match levels will decrease.

Hey DK20528,
Try adjusting your region and neutralization settings to reduce high production correlation. Additionally, instead of relying solely on your own alphas, make full use of the broader alpha pools available to you. At the master level, you have access to a diverse set of alphas [country level] that can enhance diversification and optimize your Super Alpha performance.
You will surely see a great improvement.

High production correlation can be tricky when trying to generate super alphas. Have you tried clustering your alphas using correlation matrices and selecting only the most orthogonal ones? Another approach is using PCA or autoencoders to extract uncorrelated features. Also, adding some non-linear transformations might help reduce redundancy. What methods have you already explored?

### 评论 #13 (作者: 顾问 TT72336 (Rank 96), 时间: 1年前)

Production correlation is a common challenge for most consultants because they tend to use the same operators and data fields. To differentiate yourself, consider building alphas on a new universe, leveraging newly introduced operators, and minimizing reliance on frequently used data fields. This approach can help reduce correlation and improve the uniqueness of your strategies.

It's great to see your initiative in exploring alternatives to the ts_ir operator! Have you thought about which specific operators you currently have access to? It might help to outline what you want to achieve with ts_ir, so we can brainstorm some effective combinations of the available operators.

I think you should study the super alpha materials provided by the platform, and run out of low prod corr alpha to submit

Reducing production correlation necessitates ingenuity and investigation beyond standard procedures.  Using recently introduced operators, avoiding overused data fields, and creating alphas on less-explored universes may make your work stand out.  By reducing overlap with other methods, this method helps provide distinct signals.  Additional ways to improve creativity include attempting new combinations, investigating unusual data sources, and being adaptable when developing a plan.  In the end, it is possible to enhance alpha uniqueness, lower correlation risks, and raise the likelihood of long-term success in a competitive setting by pursuing innovation and minimising dependence on conventional techniques.

To address high production correlation when creating super alphas, consider diversifying your asset universe, using uncorrelated signals, and minimizing reliance on common data fields and operators. Expanding your universe by selecting assets from different sectors or asset classes can help break the correlation. Additionally, applying correlation checks to filter out highly correlated alphas (e.g., above 0.8) before combining them into super alphas will ensure that you're blending diverse signals. Exploring new operators or datasets could also be beneficial in reducing redundancy and improving the overall effectiveness of your super alphas.

first you need to improve your single alpha, use less used fields, change neutralization, change decay then use combination functions, exploit new datasets will help you improve pro correlation.

Hi  [MK58212](/hc/en-us/profiles/24602065711639-MK58212) ,  [DK20528](/hc/en-us/profiles/24602396283031-DK20528) ,

I think in addition to all the advice in the comments before me, increasing your alpha pool in USA, EUR, ASI and CHN regions so that you have more diverse alphas for combination is essential.

Helo, for the upcoming consultant who have just unlocked super alpha, they should ensure that they have enough ASIA alphas, this help in building the ASIA super alpha.

In submitting super alpha one also should be concerned about high returns and low transaction cost.

i also have the same problem with you,because my alpha is not very many,so when i comnine the super alpha always has the problem with selfcorrelation and prod correlation,i think ,we should summit more alpha ,make the alpha diverse,then we use the regular alpha to combine the superalpha can get more choose,the diverse alpha can solve most problem

Innovative alpha generation demands strategic creativity and methodical differentiation. By diversifying asset universes, exploring unconventional data sources, and deliberately avoiding standard procedures, researchers can develop truly unique signals. The key lies in breaking traditional correlational patterns through thoughtful operator selection, investigating less-explored market segments, and maintaining flexibility in approach. Implementing rigorous correlation checks—filtering out signals with high overlap (e.g., above 0.8)—ensures the development of distinctive super alphas. Ultimately, success comes from continuously challenging conventional techniques, embracing novel combinations, and maintaining an adaptive mindset that prioritizes signal originality over computational comfort.

High production correlation can definitely be a hurdle when building SuperAlphas. A few tips that may help:

1. **Diversify Universes** : Try generating alphas across different regions (USA, ASI, GLB) or universes (TOP3000, TOP500).
2. **Reduce Operator/Datafield Overlap** : Avoid reusing the same set of operators or datafields across multiple alphas.
3. **Use Correlation Filters** : Before combining alphas, filter out those with pairwise prod corr > 0.6–0.7.
4. **Leverage New Datasets** : Explore less common datasets (e.g., earnings, sentiment) to build more unique signals.
5. **Vary Holding Periods** : Mix short-term and long-term alpha styles (e.g., delay-0, delay-5, delay-10).

Let me know if you’d like help reviewing your alpha pool strategy!

Start by tagging or naming your alphas and organizing them into distinct pools. Experiment with various combo expressions to generate diverse SuperAlphas

If I were you, I would try to perform some arithmetic operator on some existing alpha to reduce product corr. Switching between neutralization settings is also a good way to prevent that problem. If you guys have any other methods, feel free to share it below.

Production correlation is common since most consultants use the same operators and data fields. To stand out, focus on building alphas with  **new universes and recently introduced operators** . Reducing reliance on widely used data fields can also help  **differentiate your signals** . Innovation in approach is key to gaining a unique edge!

High production correlation often stems from using similar logic or datasets across alphas. One effective method to counter this is introducing orthogonal transformations like PCA or using distance-based clustering before selecting alphas for combination. This ensures you're not only filtering by performance but also maximizing diversity in predictive signals.
