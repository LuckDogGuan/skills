### 评论 #13 (作者: NH16784, 时间: 1年前)

To reduce turnover, I usually use 3 main things: decay, trade_when and hump. But high decay often eliminates the performance of alpha, so hump and trade_when are better choices. And be careful when using trade_when to not overfit alpha.

If you wanted a more explicit exit condition (like a stop loss or profit target), you would need to add another expression or logic to handle that. For example:exit_condition = abs(close - close_at_event) / close > stop_loss_or_target;This could allow you to define a separate condition for when you want to exit based on a certain percentage change from the entry price.

### 评论 #24 (作者: AS38624, 时间: 1年前)

A great point was raised about hedging to manage transaction costs across volatile markets. One way to improve hedging efficiency is by pairing trades across correlated assets, for example, if you're bullish on Japanese equities but concerned about currency risk, instead of hedging outright, you could take offsetting positions in highly correlated stocks from another region with lower fees. This allows for risk mitigation while optimizing transaction costs.

Alpha Strategy (without hedging):Objective: Generate positive alpha from stock picks based on technical indicators, such as moving average crossovers.Assets: 50% long in stock A, 50% long in stock B.Incorporating Hedging:Step 1: Identify the risk– The strategy is exposed to market risk (e.g., overall market downturn).Step 2: Hedge using options– Buy put options on an index ETF  to protect against a market drop.Step 3: Adjust allocation– Continue to hold stock A and stock B but now also have a 10% hedge position in puts.Results:Without Hedging: The strategy may experience sharp drawdowns during market downturns.With Hedging: If the market declines, the value of the put options increases, offsetting losses from stocks A and B. This reduces risk while maintaining upside potential from stock picks.

A key challenge in balancing OS performance and transaction costs is maintaining signal strength while optimizing execution. One approach is to integrate market impact models directly into the trading strategy—using historical slippage data to adjust position sizing dynamically. Additionally, combining decay functions with adaptive turnover thresholds could help fine-tune trading frequency based on real-time liquidity conditions, ensuring a balance between cost efficiency and signal persistence.

You want the best performance is important to combine alpha generation with transaction cost management. First, focus on net alpha. The return we see after including transaction costs. Optimize trading frequency to reduce your costs, and use transaction cost models to refine your strategies. Trade in liquid markets so that slippage and costs are reduced, and use automation to execute trades efficiently. Evaluate portfolio level transaction costs, focus solely on individual trades, and also keep tax efficiency in mind. Always track performance and adjust strategies so as to get the best net return.

Achieving a high Sharpe ratio can be a difficult task, especially when balancing trading frequency with the stability of your signals. Reducing trading intensity may lower the Sharpe ratio, as it can diminish the effect of the signals that were originally driving performance. However, several techniques can help mitigate these issues while still striving for improved risk-adjusted returns.Decay Functions: By incorporating decay functions, you can control the duration of signal effectiveness over time. This allows you to maintain signals for a longer period while reducing their impact as they age, effectively managing signal persistence without constantly needing high trading frequency.Rank Transformations: Applying rank transformations to your signals can help smooth out volatility and noise, which can otherwise cause your alpha to lose effectiveness. Rank transformations ensure that the relative ordering of stocks is preserved, allowing you to maintain predictive power despite market fluctuations.Liquidity Focus: Shifting to regions with higher liquidity can lower transaction costs, helping to preserve more of the alpha generated. High liquidity reduces the slippage impact and spreads, making it easier to execute trades without sacrificing the integrity of your strategy.By combining these techniques, you can enhance your trading strategy, maintain a strong Sharpe ratio, and reduce reliance on high-frequency trading. Have you considered testing these approaches with historical data to assess their effectiveness in your model?
