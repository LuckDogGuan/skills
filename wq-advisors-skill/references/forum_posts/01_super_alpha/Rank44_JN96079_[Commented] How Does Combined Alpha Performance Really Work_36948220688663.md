## 帖子正文

With the latest update now live, I’m trying to better understand how  *Combined Alpha Performance*  is derived for contributors. A few key questions I’m hoping to clarify:

### **1️⃣ Alpha Aggregation Method**

How are multiple Alphas actually merged?
Is the combination a raw average, or is there some normalization applied based on volatility, turnover, or OS length?

### **2️⃣ Impact of WQ-Selected Alphas**

When evaluating only WQ-selected Alphas, what influences the metric more?
➤ The count of selected Alphas
➤ Or the actual OS strength and quality of each selected signal?

### **3️⃣ Power Pool Integration**

How is the Power Pool’s performance positioned relative to contributor Alphas?
Is it assessed as an independent track, or blended into the overall combined performance?

### **4️⃣ Quarter-End Evaluation Logic**

When WQ decides the best path each quarter, what metric underlies the comparison?
✔ Raw OS PnL
✔ Sharpe-adjusted or risk-normalized returns
✔ Or a proprietary internal scoring model?

Is combined performance calculated as the SA  way with 1 or combo_a() methods?

Combined Alpha Performance reflects how WQ consolidates your individual alphas into a unified, risk-controlled assessment. The combination isn’t a simple average—signals are normalized, volatility-scaled, and adjusted to ensure comparable contribution before being merged. For WQ-selected alphas, quality matters far more than quantity: a few strong OS performers influence the score more than many weak ones. The Power Pool is evaluated as its own track but still contributes to your overall combined profile. At quarter-end, WQ compares different paths using risk-adjusted metrics rather than raw PnL—typically Sharpe-like, stability-aware scoring, possibly with internal proprietary weighting to favor consistent, scalable signals.

Nice breakdown. I’ve wondered the same — do selected Alpha counts matter more, or does strong OS performance dominate the combined score?

Really appreciate this discussion — the whole “combined performance” system feels more meaningful after the update, but also a bit more layered. My impression so far is that the framework is shifting away from rewarding quantity and leaning much more heavily toward consistency and OS strength. It feels like WQ is trying to surface signals that behave like  *real trading components* , not just good IS/short-term performers.

The normalization and scaling step is something I actually like, because it stops any one noisy alpha from dominating the mix. And with Power Pool now treated almost like its own lane, the structure feels closer to a multi-track evaluation rather than a single blended bucket.

Quarter-end comparison seems to follow the same philosophy: emphasize stability and risk-adjusted behavior, not just raw profit spikes. Honestly, it gives me the impression that the system now rewards “professional-grade” alphas — clean, stable, scalable — instead of rewarding anyone who just submits a ton of signals.

Overall, it feels like a shift in the right direction. It forces us to think more carefully about what actually matters long-term.

These questions are very important. I also want to understand how the system combines different alphas and what matters more, the number of selected signals or their real strength. Looking forward to more clarity on this.

These are crucial questions. I also want to know how the system combines different alphas and whether the priority lies in the number of signals chosen or their actual strength. Looking forward to more clarity on this.

This discussion highlights how Combined Alpha Performance reflects WorldQuant’s shift toward "professional-grade" research. Consolidation is not a simple average; instead, signals are normalized and volatility-scaled to ensure each alpha contributes fairly.

The consensus is that quality dominates quantity. A few strong, consistent Out-of-Sample (OS) performers influence scores more than a high volume of weak signals. This framework favors "professional" signals—clean, stable, and scalable—over raw profit spikes. Furthermore, the Power Pool operates as a distinct track. Ultimately, WorldQuant prioritizes risk-adjusted metrics and structural reliability, rewarding researchers who focus on long-term consistency rather than submission volume.

From what I’ve observed, Combined Alpha Performance clearly prioritizes quality over quantity. Alphas are normalized and risk-scaled before aggregation, so a few strong, stable OS signals tend to matter much more than many marginal ones. The framework seems designed to reward consistency and scalability rather than raw count or short-term PnL spikes.

I like your thorough explanation and observations. This makes it much easier to understand how the combined alpha performance framework operates and what factors actually influence the evaluations.

This is a great set of questions because  **Combined Alpha Performance (CAP)**  is often misunderstood as a simple arithmetic outcome, when in reality it reflects  *portfolio-level behavior*  on  **WorldQuant Brain** . From what experienced contributors generally infer, alphas are not merged as a naive average. Instead, normalization implicitly matters: volatility, effective contribution window, and turnover characteristics all influence how much an alpha actually “counts” in the combined book. Two alphas with identical OS Sharpe but very different turnover or persistence profiles will not contribute equally after costs.

Regarding WQ-selected alphas, quality tends to dominate quantity. A smaller number of stable, low-correlation, cost-efficient alphas usually improves CAP more than many marginal ones. Selection implicitly filters for robustness, which means weak alphas can dilute combined performance even if they pass individual thresholds. As for the Power Pool, it’s best thought of as a parallel, internally optimized ensemble rather than a simple add-on; its role is comparative and stabilizing, not just additive. Quarter-end evaluation is almost certainly risk-aware—raw PnL alone would be far too noisy—so contributors should think in terms of  *durable, risk-adjusted contribution*  rather than short-term spikes.

Thank you for laying these questions out so clearly—this is exactly the level of transparency many contributors are trying to reason toward, even if the full mechanics aren’t public. Your breakdown shows a strong portfolio-level mindset rather than a single-alpha view, which is crucial once people move beyond just “passing” and start thinking about sustainable contribution.

I especially appreciate how you separated aggregation mechanics from evaluation logic. That distinction helps explain why adding more alphas doesn’t always improve outcomes and why CAP can sometimes move counterintuitively. Discussions like this help recalibrate expectations and push contributors toward designing alphas that  *play well with others* , not just look good in isolation. Thanks for starting such a thoughtful thread—it’s the kind of question that benefits the entire community, especially as more people focus on long-term contribution quality rather than short-term metrics.

Based on my experience, Combined Alpha Performance places far more emphasis on quality than sheer volume. Since alphas are normalized and risk-adjusted before being combined, a small set of strong, stable out-of-sample signals usually has a much greater impact than a large collection of marginal ones. The structure appears intentionally geared toward rewarding consistency and scalability, rather than raw alpha counts or short-lived PnL surges.

CAP emphasizes quality over quantity. Since alphas are normalized and risk-scaled before aggregation, a few strong, stable out-of-sample signals outweigh numerous weaker ones. The system favors consistency and scalability rather than sheer volume or short-term PnL spikes.

Combined Alpha Performance is not a simple average. Alphas are normalized (risk, volatility, turnover, OS length) before aggregation. Quality dominates count—few strong OS alphas beat many weak ones. Power Pool is evaluated as a separate benchmark track. Quarter-end selection relies on risk-adjusted, stability-weighted internal scoring—not raw OS PnL alone.
