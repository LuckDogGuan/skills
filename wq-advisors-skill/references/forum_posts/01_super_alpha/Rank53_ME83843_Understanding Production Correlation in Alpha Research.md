Production correlation is a key metric used to measure how similar an alpha is to other live or submitted alphas in terms of its actual behavior.📌Formula (simplified idea):Production Correlation is generally computed as the correlation between the returns (or PnL time series) of two alphas over the same evaluation period:ProdCorr(A, B) = corr(PnL_A, PnL_B)In simple terms, it checks how closely two alphas move together in real performance, not just in design.📊How it is computed:Take daily (or periodic) PnL of Alpha A and Alpha BAlign them over the same time windowCompute Pearson correlation between the two return seriesA higher value means both alphas behave very similarly in production.💡Why it matters:Production correlation is important because it directly reflectstrue similarity of signals in real market conditions. Even if two alphas look different in formula, they may still be driven by the same underlying idea.Low production correlation is desirable when building portfolios because it:• improves diversification• reduces crowding risk• increases combined portfolio stability• helps avoid redundant signals🧠Key insight:Two alphas are not truly different if they produce the same PnL behavior.In alpha research, uniqueness is not about structure — it is aboutindependent performance.
