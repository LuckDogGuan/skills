Its very easy to design alphas for the India region, if you only focus on maintaining good after-cost performance, and capacity rather than simply stacking complex operations. Avoid relying solely on a single neutralization, which can wash out meaningful signals, instead, consider structured neutralization such as industry or liquidity buckets to preserve signal strength. Optimize for after-cost returns by monitoring margin-to-returns ratios, turnover, and slippage, as a slightly lower raw Sharpe with stable post-cost performance often outperforms a high pre-cost Sharpe that collapses under trading costs. Unique, orthogonal alphas tend to be more valuable than heavily engineered composites, which can increase production complexity and reduce scalability, particularly in the India market where liquidity and crowding constraints are significant. Alphas that underperform in ASI can perform strongly in IND, and those that succeed in both regions often become high-quality candidates. Re-running or adapting ASI ideas in IND can provide fast wins, provided they are tuned to Indian market structure and exposures. Ultimately, the goal is balance: robust performance across regions, efficient cost structures, and scalable capacity define a high-quality India-focused alpha.

This is a very practical and experience-driven perspective on IND alpha design. I like the emphasis on after-cost performance and capacity as first-order objectives rather than overengineering expressions, which is especially important given liquidity and crowding constraints in India. The point about favoring structured neutralization over purely statistical methods is spot on—preserving economic structure often keeps real signal intact. Your observation that moderate raw Sharpe with stable post-cost behavior can dominate fragile high-Sharpe signals is an important mindset shift. I also agree that IND can be a strong proving ground for ideas that struggle in ASI, and that cross-region adaptation, rather than constant reinvention, often produces the highest-quality outcomes.

The  article  is  very resourceful.  However, lately  i  have  been  facing  multiple  challenges  with  production  correlation  above  0.67  for  very high  quality. How can i possibly  reduce  this  to  below  50%?

On top of that, I think you should also control the turnover of the IND alphas. It should range somewhere under 20% to make sure that the alpha is applicable.

Good summary! Turn over control and high margin for investable PNL is important in IND - IMO.

India alphas work best when focused on after-cost performance and capacity, not complexity. Avoid excessive statistical neutralization; use structured group controls instead. Monitor turnover, slippage, and margins, and favor simple, orthogonal signals. Many ASI ideas translate well to IND when properly tuned.

Good new people statistical neutralization isnt avaiable for IND region

How do you balance between tuning ASI strategies for IND versus building from scratch—what works best? 🤔

Hey,

This is very good explanation for IND region

thanks for pointing that out. I've updated the original post.

So in majority of cases ASI alphas don't just work in IND region (just as GLB and ASI perform similarly), due to having lesser number of datafields. But in case of IND due to it being more sensitive to liquidity you need to focus on building over rich datafields with high coverage, you can try using the previously submitted ASI specific alphas as the templates for better fields in IND region.

In your experience, what’s the best way to balance capacity and turnover in IND without sacrificing signal uniqueness—do you prioritize longer lookbacks or cost-aware decay structures?

Classical PV signal like mean reversion is a good starting point in new region like IND, since there is so few alpha in IND pool.
