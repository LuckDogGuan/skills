**First** , you can try using newer Risk Neutralization methods like  **RAM** , or exploring different Universes such as  **TOPDIV3000** .

**Second** , make good use of  **Combo Expressions** .

**Third** , apply weighting to the selected Alphas within your  **Selection Expression** .

**Fourth** , mix your own Alphas with others’ — just avoid selecting too many at once.

By doing these things, you can effectively avoid the limitations caused by Product Correlation. 💡

The simplest way is to change neutralisation, which will help to place your idea as new in a new market. Otherwise, make your selection as unique as possible using the power of selection expression, using such criteria as  **prod_correlation** . That will help!

try out new super alpha ideas, using operators you haven't used before. you can also modify your super alpha in the "simulate" section to get the best results.

thanks for this , Start with fresh, original concepts rather than reusing existing themes to ensure uniqueness, Combine value, momentum, quality, and sentiment factors over multiple timeframes.

**Reducing  `prod_correlation`  in super alphas is essential for robust diversification and combo efficiency.**  Some proven techniques include:

- **Combining orthogonal ideas**  (e.g., valuation vs. sentiment vs. technical)
- **Varying time horizons**  (mix short-term and long-term signals)
- **Using underutilized data fields or groups**
- **Residualizing overlapping alphas**  to isolate unique components
- **Applying group-level neutralization**  ( `group_neutralize` ,  `resid` , etc.)
- **Testing in simulate mode**  with the  `prod_correlation`  metric active

Good question! One effective way to reduce product correlation in super alphas is to  **combine signals that target different styles or time horizons** —for example, pairing structural fundamentals with short-term sentiment or flow-based alphas. Before combining, I usually check  **pairwise correlations**  in the IS and OS periods and prefer components with low overlap in their ranking behavior. Applying techniques like  **orthogonalization** ,  **PCA** , or even just normalizing and  `zscore` -ing before  `add`  can also help reduce dominance and correlation. Curious—has anyone tried using clustering to select alpha groups before combo?

Great tips from everyone thanks for sharing! I’ve found that combining signals with different rebalancing frequencies (e.g., daily vs. weekly) also helps reduce prod_correlation while preserving edge.

Reducing  **prod_correlation**  in super alphas is Apply  `group_neutralize` , or cross-alpha residualization to strip away common exposures and isolate unique predictive components. Group-level neutralization (by sector, industry, or country) can also help.

The easiest approach is to adjust the neutralization method, which helps position your idea as fresh within a new market segment. Additionally, make your selection as distinctive as possible by leveraging the power of selection expressions with criteria like prod_correlation. This strategy can significantly improve your results!

One of the easiest approaches is to adjust neutralization, which can help position your idea as new in a different market. Alternatively, you can maximize uniqueness by leveraging the selection expression applying criteria such as  `prod_correlation ` to differentiate your Alpha. This will greatly increase its chances of standing out.

Great question! One useful approach to lowering product correlation in super alphas is to blend signals that focus on different investment styles or varying time frames. For instance, combining long-term structural fundamentals with short-term sentiment or flow-driven alphas can be effective. Before merging these signals, I typically examine their pairwise correlations during both in-sample (IS) and out-of-sample (OS) periods, aiming to select components that show minimal overlap in their ranking patterns. Additionally, methods like orthogonalization, principal component analysis (PCA), or simply normalizing and applying z-score transformations before aggregation can help reduce the risk of any single signal dominating or correlating too highly. I’m curious—has anyone experimented with clustering techniques to group alphas prior to combining them? It seems like an interesting way to further enhance diversification and lower correlations.

Thanks for starting this discussion on reducing product correlation in Super Alphas — it’s a challenge that many of us encounter, especially when we try to combine our strongest-performing signals. Your question reminds us that performance isn’t just about maximizing IS/OS scores; it’s also about ensuring diversity and robustness. Reducing correlation can greatly improve risk-adjusted returns and stability over different market regimes, so it’s worth investing time into this process. I appreciate you bringing it up, as it encourages the community to share strategies, examples, and even tools for correlation analysis. Conversations like this help us all refine our Super Alpha construction process.

To reduce prod_correlation in Super Alphas, focus on combining orthogonal ideas, vary time horizons, apply group-level neutralization, and consider residualizing overlapping alphas. Using different operators and underutilized datasets can also help create more unique, low-correlation components.

Totally agree - mixing orthogonal styles and applying residualization before combo has been a game changer for me. It’s like pruning overlapping branches so each component has room to grow its own edge.

Reducing product correlation in Super Alphas is mainly about designing the input alphas so they are functionally diverse, not just syntactically different. Many times two alphas look different on paper but end up correlated because they rely on the same base fields, time horizons, or transformations (e.g., repeated use of  `rank` ,  `decay_linear` ,  `ts_mean` ). To lower correlation, you can diversify by mixing operators (rank vs z-score vs raw), varying horizons (short vs medium vs long term), and pulling from different data categories (fundamental, price/volume, analyst estimates, etc.). Neutralization also matters—industry or country neutralization can help reduce shared exposures. When combining signals, try weighting or transforming them differently rather than just adding. A practical trick is to build smaller pools of low-correlated alphas first, then blend them—this usually results in a Super Alpha with stronger stability and lower product correlation.

Reducing product correlation in Super Alphas is one of the most important aspects of building a stable, long-term portfolio. The first step is to diversify across  **styles**  — for example, mixing valuation, momentum, sentiment, and volatility signals, rather than stacking many similar momentum alphas. Next, you can actively monitor  `prod_corr`  and prune or replace highly correlated components. Applying  **group-neutralization**  (by industry, subindustry, or country) also helps, since many hidden correlations come from structural exposures rather than true signal overlap. Another effective method is to vary  **time horizons**  (short-term decay vs. long-term smoothing), which reduces alignment between signals. Additionally, transformations such as  `signed_power` ,  `ts_decay_exp_window` , or  `bucket`  can shift distributions enough to improve orthogonality while preserving alpha intent. Finally, I like to track decay and turnover alongside prod_corr — sometimes a signal that looks unique on paper may still fail if its trading pattern is too synchronized with others.

Thank you for raising this very practical and widely relevant question. Many consultants (myself included) often focus on maximizing Sharpe or fitness, but your post is a great reminder that correlation control is equally important for long-term Super Alpha success. By asking about reducing prod_corr directly, you’re encouraging all of us to think more carefully about diversity in our alpha pools, rather than just chasing performance. I also like how your question is open-ended, which invites the community to share different strategies and experiences. Posts like this spark valuable discussions because they touch on challenges that nearly every contributor encounters. Thanks again for bringing this up — it’s the kind of straightforward but essential question that helps strengthen the collective understanding in our community.
