how to use reduce category operators in an alpha like reduce like reduce_avg,reduce_count,reduce_ir etc.

Can someone please give an example

This is just about the only type of operator for which I don't have a good grasp. Seems no one else does, either.

The  **reduce operator**  is highly effective in  **combo expressions**  and is particularly useful for minimizing self-correlation in SuperAlphas. Here's an example of how it can be used:

stats = generate_stats(alpha);

ic = reduce_ir(self_corr(stats.returns, 120));

1/(1+ic)

Additionally, you can refer to this forum post, which explains dynamic selection in SuperAlphas using the  **fraction**  operator, followed by the use of the  **reduce operator**  for minimizing self-correlation and enhancing diversity.

Hi  [顾问 AM60509 (Rank 61)](/hc/en-us/profiles/25127049757975-顾问 AM60509 (Rank 61)) !

reduce_operators should be used together with self_corr operator in combo expression of superalpha .

Example:

```
stats = generate_stats(alpha); innerCorr = self_corr(stats.returns, 500); ic = if_else(innerCorr == 1.0, nan, innerCorr); maxCorr = reduce_max(ic); 1 - maxCorr
```

Here innerCorr - is correlation of selected alphas with each other. Dimension of innerCorr (which is output of self_corr operator) is Days * Alpha * Alpha. But to simulate SuperAlpha we need as output Days * Alpha. That is why the use of reduce_operator is needed - to reduce the dimension of self_corr output.

Ideas that you can explore further:

* instead of calculating self_corr based on returns, you can calculate it based on drawdown, or other stats parameters of an alpha.

* you can use different reduce_operators on top of self_corr, just remember that if you use self_corr, reduce_ operator is a must!

You can use the reduce operator only in a Super Alpha Combo Expression not for regular alpha submissions. If you are submitting a super alpha, you will then have access to use reduce operators within your combo expressions.

For Example:

stats = generate_stats(alpha);
ic = reduce_norm(self_corr(stats.returns, 120));    
1/(1+ic)

Another useful approach when working with reduce operators is understanding how different reduction methods impact the final signal. For example,  `reduce_avg(self_corr(...))`  provides an average correlation across alphas, whereas  `reduce_max(self_corr(...))`  ensures that the most correlated pair is minimized.

You can use reduce operators in a Super Alpha combo expression to collapse multi-dimensional outputs—like those from self_corr—into a simpler form. For example, you might calculate the self-correlation of alpha returns over 120 days and then apply reduce_avg to get an average correlation:

```
stats = generate_stats(alpha);
ic = reduce_avg(self_corr(stats.returns, 120));
final_signal = 1 / (1 + ic);
```

It's great that you're exploring reduce category operators! To enhance your understanding, could you clarify whether you're looking for examples in a particular context or dataset? Also, sharing the specific goals you have in mind may help in providing more tailored examples that fit your needs.

one technique is stacking multiple reduce operators. For example, you could first apply  `reduce_max(self_corr(stats.returns, 120))`  to eliminate the most correlated alphas, and then use  `reduce_avg`  on the remaining subset to further refine the signal. This dual-reduction approach could balance diversity and predictive strength in an optimal way.

### **Using Reduce Operators with Self_Corr for Alpha Optimization**

Reduce operators help aggregate high-dimensional data, making them essential when applying  **self_corr**  in  **superalpha**  construction. Since  **self_corr**  produces a matrix (Days × Alpha × Alpha), reduce operators transform it into a usable (Days × Alpha) format.

#### **Example Implementation**

makefile

```
stats = generate_stats(alpha);  
innerCorr = self_corr(stats.drawdown, 250);  
ic = if_else(innerCorr > 0.9, nan, innerCorr);  
avgCorr = reduce_avg(ic);  
1 - avgCorr  

```

Here:

- **self_corr**  calculates alpha correlations based on  **drawdowns**  over 250 days.
- **reduce_avg**  computes the average correlation across all alphas, helping minimize redundancy.

#### **Further Enhancements**

- Instead of  **drawdown** , try  **volatility or Sharpe ratio**  to refine signal selection.
- Use  **reduce_ir**  for information ratio-based filtering or  **reduce_median**  to remove outliers.

Applying  **self_corr**  with the right  **reduce_operators**  ensures diversified signals and improves alpha uniqueness. Best of luck optimizing your strategy! 🚀

Great question! To use reduce category operators like  `reduce_avg` ,  `reduce_count` , and  `reduce_ir`  in an alpha, you typically apply them when you want to aggregate or reduce data across categories or groups, such as sectors, industries, or regions.

Values are aggregated across groups by reduce category operators.  To effectively summarize data, use reduce_count(x, group), reduce_avg(x, group), etc.
