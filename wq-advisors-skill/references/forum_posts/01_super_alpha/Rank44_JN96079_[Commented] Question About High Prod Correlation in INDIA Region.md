## 帖子正文

Hi everyone, I’m trying to create alphas in the new  **INDIA (IND)**  region, but I’m seeing high  **prod correlation**  very often. I thought that because this region was added recently, prod overlap would be low. Can someone explain why prod correlation is still high in IND? Is it because many people use similar ideas or because the universe is small? Any simple explanation would help.

High prod correlation in the IND region is actually quite expected, even though the region itself is relatively new. The main driver is usually not timing, but structure. The IND universe is smaller and more concentrated than US or EU, which means many alphas end up relying on similar liquid names and shared risk factors such as size, liquidity, and momentum. Additionally, a large fraction of commonly used datasets and operators tend to map onto the same underlying economic signals, even when expressions look different syntactically. For example, many valuation, volume, or sentiment-based ideas collapse into correlated cross-sectional ranks after normalization. In a newer region, researchers also tend to start with “safe” or well-known alpha templates, which naturally increases overlap. To reduce prod correlation, it often helps to diversify operator types (e.g., mixing time-series with cross-sectional logic), extend lookback horizons, or anchor signals with region-specific datasets that capture local microstructure or fundamental effects unique to India.

Thank you for bringing up this question — it’s one that a lot of people encounter when they first move into the IND region, but it’s rarely explained clearly. Your intuition that a new region should automatically imply low prod correlation is very reasonable, and the fact that you’re questioning it shows good research discipline. Discussions like this help newer and experienced researchers alike understand that correlation is driven more by universe characteristics and shared signal structures than by how “fresh” a region is. I also appreciate that you asked for a simple explanation rather than just a workaround, because understanding the root cause is what ultimately leads to better alpha design. This kind of question adds real value to the WorldQuant community and encourages more thoughtful regional research.

I think it depends on the data sets. For example, sets such as model* and other* have become pretty crowded after weeks of alpha development by consultants

High prod correlation in IND happens mainly because of the  **small universe (~500 stocks)**  and  **crowded ideas/datasets**  (price, volume, ASI-style signals). Even though IND is new, many contributors use similar operators and logic, which quickly leads to overlap. To reduce prod corr, try  **diversifying datasets** , changing  **combination/neutralization methods (e.g., vector_neut, signed_power)** , managing  **turnover** , and building signals with  **distinct economic intuition** , not just higher Sharpe.

High prod correlation in IND is expected due to the smaller, more concentrated universe and many alphas loading on the same core risk factors. Even different-looking formulas often collapse to similar underlying signals after normalization, increasing overlap.

High prod correlation in IND is quite normal. The universe is smaller and more concentrated, so many different-looking alphas end up loading on the same core factors after normalization. Region size and structure matter more than how new the region is.

If numerous people provide signals with comparable predictors, holding times, and structures, they will correlate even in a medium-sized universe like IND. Try using alternative time horizons and regime-specific reasoning instead of simple factor blends if you want reduced correlation.

It is because same alpha ideas of USA and ASI region some times work equally good .So sometimes people end up submitting same alpha.

High production correlation in the IND region is actually expected, even though the market is relatively new. The main driver is structure rather than timing. The IND universe is smaller and more concentrated than US or EU markets, meaning many alphas rely on the same liquid names and common risk factors like size, liquidity, and momentum. Additionally, widely used datasets and operators often map to similar underlying economic signals, even if the expressions appear syntactically different. For instance, valuation, volume, or sentiment-based ideas frequently collapse into correlated cross-sectional ranks after normalization. Researchers entering a new region also tend to start with “safe” or well-known alpha templates, which naturally increases overlap.

To reduce production correlation, it helps to diversify operator types, extend lookback periods, or anchor signals with region-specific datasets that capture India’s unique microstructure or fundamental dynamics. Understanding these structural drivers is key to designing more independent and robust alphas.

What strategies have you found most effective for reducing alpha correlation in smaller or highly concentrated regional universes?

In smaller or more concentrated markets like India, elevated production correlation is largely structural and therefore not surprising. The investable universe is narrower, with liquidity concentrated in a limited set of names, so many alphas naturally load on the same core risk factors such as size, liquidity, and momentum. On top of that, commonly used datasets and standard operators often encode similar economic information, even when the formulas look different. After normalization, valuation, volume, or sentiment signals frequently converge into highly correlated cross-sectional ranks. New researchers also tend to rely on proven, conservative templates, which further increases overlap. To meaningfully reduce correlation, it is often effective to vary operator families, lengthen or diversify lookback horizons, and incorporate region-specific data that reflects local market structure or fundamentals. Recognizing these structural constraints is essential for building alphas that are more independent and resilient.

High production correlation in IND is unsurprising given the smaller, more concentrated universe and the tendency for many alphas to load on the same core risk factors. As a result, even formulas that appear different often reduce to similar underlying signals after normalization, leading to greater overlap.

### 评论 #12 (作者: AG14039, 时间: 5个月前)

This happens because the same alpha ideas from the USA and ASI regions can sometimes perform equally well, leading people to submit essentially the same alpha across regions.

This happens because similar alpha ideas can perform equally well in both the USA and ASI regions. As a result, it’s common for people to submit the same alpha across multiple regions.

High production correlation in IND is largely unavoidable because the universe is smaller and more concentrated, with many alphas implicitly exposed to the same dominant risk factors. As a result, expressions that appear different at the formula level often converge to similar effective signals after normalization and risk controls, leading to higher overlap in production.

If many people submit signals with similar predictors, holding periods, and structures, they will correlate—even in a medium-sized universe like IND. To reduce correlation, consider alternative time horizons and regime-specific logic rather than just blending factors.

### 评论 #16 (作者: LB76673, 时间: 5个月前)

High prod correlation in IND is common because the universe is relatively small and many researchers start with the same core datasets and operators, so different expressions often end up producing similar exposures. Even in a new region, popular signals like price momentum, liquidity, or simple fundamentals converge quickly, which drives correlation up. To reduce this, you usually need more differentiated datasets, alternative transformations, or different horizons rather than assuming a new region alone will guarantee low overlap.

This is actually pretty normal for IND. Even though the region is new, the universe is relatively small and a lot of people gravitate toward the same price, risk, or analyst datasets. That makes ideas overlap quickly. Also many signals behave similarly once costs and constraints are applied, so prod corr shows up faster than expected.
