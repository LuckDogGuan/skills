**Tips for getting started with  [Sentiment](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets?category=sentiment)  Datasets:**

- Sentiment represents the aggregate market mood about stocks.
- Rising stock price is characterized by positive or "bullish" sentiment, while a declining stock price is characterized by negative or "bearish" sentiment.
- The intensity of sentiment represents the strength of the sentiment.
  - A high intensity of sentiment, regardless of the mood or direction, exists when strong market moves occur.
  - For example, positive market sentiment combined with high intensity is typically a characteristic of strong bullish moves in prices.
- Sentiment data can help us better predict market behavior and improve our forecasting, not only for price direction but also for volatility and volume traded.
- Sentiment data have data fields of sentiment scores of an event. Unlike fundamental data, these data naturally have high frequencies, which leads to high turnovers in an Alpha.
- To achieve reasonable margin rates, you are advised to use the following operations: hump_decay, ts_decay_linear, and ts_decay_exp_window. But you should be careful with the usage of lookback days greater than 63 (i.e., one quarter) as older events may have no impact.
- Data may be based on information from newspapers, news websites, Facebook, Twitter, blog posts, discussion groups, and forums.
- Social sentiment indicators help investors identify information in social media that could cause a stock’s price to increase or decrease in the near future. They also help businesses understand how they may be performing in the eyes of their consumers.

**Example Alpha Ideas:**

- Long/short stocks with positive/negative sentiment, filtering out days and stocks with low sentiment volume.
- Use sentiment volume as a proxy for the market's attention towards a stock. This could be used directly as a stock returns predictor or a condition in trade_when.

Hi,

Thank you for the informative article.

Since we are on the MAPC that have us build Alphas in the GLB regions, can we use alternative sentiment datasets that is available to the GLB regions?

For example, with the Sentiment Data, if we use the search function to search for data in GLB regions ( [https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/search/data-fields?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0®ion=GLB&search=sentiment&universe=MINVOL1M](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/search/data-fields?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0%C2%AEion=GLB&search=sentiment&universe=MINVOL1M) ), we could find 
1. Sentiment Data for Equity (socialmedia12), 
2. Web Sources News Sentiment Data (news20), 
3. Lexical Breakdown Data (socialmedia5), 
4. International sentiment analysis NLP model (other351), 
5. Smart Conference call transcript data (news87) 
and other related datasets that contains the sentiment scores.

Also, with the Search Engine Data, also with the search functions, we can find similar GLB datasets ( [https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/search/data-fields?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0®ion=GLB&search=search%20engine&universe=MINVOL1M](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/search/data-fields?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0%C2%AEion=GLB&search=search%20engine&universe=MINVOL1M) ), such as:
1. Web Intelligence Data (other47),
2. Webpage View Statistics (news66),
and other related datasets.

What do you think about the above search datasets?

Thank you.

Sure, you can try those out of course!

When trying these datasets out on GLB region, pay attention to their coverage, since some of the may only have coverage on major markets (such as USA or Japen), you may want to find one that has higher coverage, or found ways to backfill them.

Sentiment datasets are a powerful tool for understanding market mood and predicting stock behavior. It's interesting to see how the intensity of sentiment can highlight major market moves, like bullish or bearish trends. The high-frequency nature of sentiment data indeed requires careful management of turnover, and the suggested decay operations like hump_decay and ts_decay_exp_window seem like great tools to smooth out short-term noise. The idea of using sentiment volume as a market attention proxy is clever and could be a valuable condition to improve alpha strategy. I'll definitely experiment with these ideas in my models!

I think a more effective way to reduce turnover data sentiment is to use the day from last change, or ts arg, which captures the timing of transactions.

Thank you for sharing these insightful tips on sentiment datasets! 

How would you incorporate real-time sentiment shifts (e.g., social media trends) into your alpha strategy? Would it be beneficial to combine sentiment data with traditional indicators like momentum or volatility to improve prediction accuracy?

- **Sentiment**  in trading refers to the general market mood towards a particular stock or market in general. Sentiment can be either positive ("bullish") or negative ("bearish"), based on whether the stock price is rising or falling.

### **Getting Started with Sentiment Datasets**

Sentiment datasets provide insights into public opinion or sentiment regarding a particular asset, company, sector, or market. These datasets are often sourced from social media, news articles, analysts' reports, earnings calls, or other forms of unstructured text. The goal is to quantify how people feel about certain assets or financial instruments to guide investment strategies.

Sentiment analysis uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to evaluate and classify text into sentiment scores (positive, negative, or neutral). These scores can then be used to inform trading strategies or alpha generation.

#### **Key Components of Sentiment Datasets:**

1. **Sentiment Score:**
   - The sentiment score typically ranges from -1 (highly negative) to +1 (highly positive). A neutral score (0) means no clear sentiment.
   - The score is derived from the analysis of textual data, where words, phrases, and overall tone are analyzed to assign a sentiment value.
2. **Textual Data Sources:**
   - **Social Media:**  Twitter, Reddit, and other platforms where public opinion is shared can provide real-time sentiment.
   - **News Articles:**  Media outlets provide qualitative insights that are analyzed to gauge market sentiment about stocks, industries, or countries.
   - **Earnings Calls and Reports:**  Transcripts of earnings calls, where executives discuss performance, are often mined for sentiment to predict stock price movements.
   - **Analyst Reports:**  Sentiment derived from analysts’ recommendations (buy, hold, sell) and their textual analysis.
3. **Data Fields:**
   - **Raw Sentiment Score:**  The raw sentiment associated with a text, often provided as a score between -1 and +1.
   - **Aggregated Sentiment Scores:**  Sentiment can be aggregated over time, such as a daily, weekly, or monthly sentiment score.
   - **Volume of Mentions:**  The frequency with which a company, sector, or market is mentioned in sentiment data, which can serve as a signal for increasing interest or market shifts.

#### **Operators and Techniques for Working with Sentiment Data:**

1. **Sentiment-Based Signal Creation:**
   - You can use sentiment scores to create trading signals by going long on stocks with positive sentiment or shorting stocks with negative sentiment. For example:
   - **Buy Signal:**  Go long on a stock when its sentiment score is greater than 0.5 (indicating strong positive sentiment).
   - **Sell Signal:**  Go short on a stock when its sentiment score is less than -0.5 (indicating strong negative sentiment).
2. **Volume and Sentiment Interaction:**
   - The combination of sentiment and volume data can help predict the strength of price movements. For example, when sentiment is highly positive and there is a spike in trading volume, it may indicate an impending upward price movement.
3. **Time-Series Analysis:**
   - Sentiment data is typically time-series data, and applying time-series analysis (e.g.,  `ts_zscore` ,  `ts_corr` ) to sentiment scores helps normalize the data over time and remove trends or seasonality, making it more useful for prediction.
4. **Neutralization Techniques:**
   - You can neutralize sentiment signals by industry, sector, or other factors using  `group_neutralize()`  to control for any biases that might arise from the broader market or sector sentiment.
5. **Aggregating Sentiment:**
   - **Rolling Mean:**  Use a rolling mean of sentiment scores to smooth out daily fluctuations and better capture long-term sentiment trends.
   - **Moving Averages:**  Apply moving averages on sentiment scores over various timeframes (e.g., 5-day, 30-day) to generate more stable signals.

#### **Example Alpha Strategies Using Sentiment Data:**

1. **Momentum Strategy with Sentiment:**
   - Combine sentiment analysis with momentum indicators. For example, create a signal by:
   - Going long on stocks with a sentiment score above 0.7 and a positive 30-day moving average.
   - Going short on stocks with a sentiment score below -0.7 and a negative 30-day moving average.
2. **Reversal Strategy:**
   - If a stock has a very positive sentiment score but is significantly overvalued (based on fundamental analysis), consider using a reversal strategy:
   - Go short when sentiment is overly positive and there is a divergence between price and fundamentals.
   - Go long when sentiment is extremely negative but the stock is fundamentally strong (indicating a potential reversal).
3. **Event-Driven Strategies:**
   - Analyze sentiment before and after significant corporate events such as earnings releases, mergers, or acquisitions.
   - If sentiment shifts significantly before an earnings release, it might signal an upcoming price movement.
   - Positive sentiment before an acquisition may indicate a higher likelihood of the target company's stock rising.
4. **Sentiment as a Risk Factor:**
   - Incorporate sentiment into risk models to measure how sensitive a stock’s price is to changes in public sentiment. Use sentiment as an additional risk factor when constructing portfolios or evaluating asset volatility.

#### **Challenges with Sentiment Datasets:**

1. **Noise and Volatility:**
   - Sentiment data can be volatile and subject to noise, especially from social media platforms. Tweets or comments that are not representative of broader market sentiment may skew results.
2. **Contextual Understanding:**
   - Sentiment analysis models may struggle to understand sarcasm, irony, or subtle nuances in language. Therefore, sentiment scores may not always perfectly align with market realities.
3. **Sentiment Saturation:**
   - In some cases, extreme positive or negative sentiment may indicate that the market has already priced in the sentiment, reducing the potential for further price movement.

#### **Getting Started with Sentiment Data:**

1. **Understand the Data:**
   - Review the data fields and sources used for sentiment scoring. Make sure you understand how sentiment is calculated (e.g., text-based models, sentiment lexicons).
2. **Test Different Timeframes:**
   - Experiment with different aggregation periods (e.g., daily, weekly) to see which timeframes provide the most actionable insights.
3. **Combine Sentiment with Other Data:**
   - Sentiment alone might not be sufficient for creating robust trading strategies. Combine sentiment with other factors like price data, volume, or financial ratios to improve prediction accuracy.
4. **Backtest Strategies:**
   - As with any data, it's crucial to backtest sentiment-based strategies on historical data to ensure that your model is viable and provides a risk-adjusted return.

By integrating sentiment analysis into your strategies, you can potentially gain insights into market sentiment shifts and predict price movements more effectively, making sentiment datasets a powerful tool in quantitative finance.
