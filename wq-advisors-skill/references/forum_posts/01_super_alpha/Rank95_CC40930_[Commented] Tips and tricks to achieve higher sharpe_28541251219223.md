1. **Increase Alpha Return:**
   - Alpha represents excess returns over a benchmark.
   - Better return predictions improve alpha:
   - Use short-term data like price-volume trends or news.
   - Use long-term data like fundamentals and analyst reports.
   - Model complexity trade-offs:
   - Simple models = more robust but lower returns.
   - Complex models = higher returns but risk of overfitting.
2. **Reduce Volatility:**
   - Understand volatility sources:
   - Consider stock-specific and market-wide risks.
   - Use  **neutralization**  strategies:
   - Reduce exposure to market-wide or sector-specific risks to stabilize returns.
3. **Practical Advice:**
   - Consistent research and learning are essential.
   - Engage with educational resources and community forums for shared insights and best practices.

Please comment if you would like a deeper dive into any specific area of this concept..

This is a well-structured approach to improving the Sharpe Ratio by focusing on both increasing alpha and reducing volatility. The emphasis on balancing short-term and long-term data for return predictions is particularly insightful, as it aligns with the need for both agility and a fundamental basis for decision-making. Highlighting the trade-off between model complexity and robustness is also crucial—many overlook the risks of overfitting in pursuit of higher returns.

### 评论 #3 (作者: AN57408, 时间: 1年前)

I totally agree with you.
In my experience during the process of research alphas, when I have an alpha with good signals, I often try combining it with a risk data field (e.g., risk momentum). By doing so, the Sharpe ratio of my alpha improves significantly. However, not all signals work well with risk, but in my experience, most cases are effective.

Hi HT16465!

> can you give an example or detail how to increase Sharpe by consider stock-specific and market-wide risk?

1. You can calculate different factors by instruments by yourself, for example momentum factor or size factor. Factor - is just an expression that outputs some number for each stock each day. If you want market-wide factor, you can use group_mean. Or use datafields like factor returns, factor styles (search them in Data explorer.

2. There are several ways to neutralize to factors. Use vector_neut, ts_vector_neut, or create custom groups using bucket and then apply group_neutralize.

3. You can calculate correlation with factor. ts_corr(returns, group_sum(inst_pnl(factor), d)

If universe has large amount of instruments, then groups like subindustry, industry work better. If universe is small then sector, industry. For ASI, EUR, GLB, AMR I'd advise to always use neutralization to country + smth. You can combine two groups using group_cartesian_product operator

Hi  [顾问 CT68712 (Rank 27)](/hc/en-us/profiles/15219840701719-顾问 CT68712 (Rank 27)) !

> the balance between  **short-term data**  (like price trends) and  **long-term data**  (like fundamentals) – how do you integrate these effectively without overfitting the model?

I would not recommend to combine in one alpha long and short-term data without particular need for it. If you want to do this, then try using short-term data to define sign of position (long/short) and long-term data to define size.

> regarding  **neutralization strategies** , could you share some practical methods or models commonly used to reduce market-wide risks?

You can use risk neutralizations in settings (slow, fast, slow and fast, crowding). Or find different risk factors in data explorer and try to neutralize to these fields.

非常赞同上述讨论中提到的关于提高夏普比率的策略。特别是将短期数据和长期数据结合起来预测回报的方法，这对于在保持模型灵活性的同时确保决策的基础性至关重要。此外，对于模型复杂度和鲁棒性之间的权衡，我认为这是一个经常被忽视的重要方面。在追求更高回报的同时，我们必须警惕过拟合的风险。

我特别感兴趣的是如何在实际中应用中性和化策略来减少市场风险。例如，我们如何确定哪些风险因素是最重要的，以及如何有效地将它们纳入我们的模型中？此外，对于不同地区和不同数据集的选择，是否有特定的最佳实践或模式可以分享？期待听到更多关于这些主题的深入讨论。

Achieving a higher  **Sharpe ratio**  in quantitative finance requires improving the portfolio's risk-adjusted returns. This involves maximizing returns while effectively managing and minimizing risk.

### **Portfolio Construction and Optimization**

#### **a. Diversification**

- **Across Asset Classes** : Include equities, fixed income, commodities, and alternative investments to reduce unsystematic risk.
- **Geographic Diversification** : Spread exposure across regions to avoid localized shocks.
- **Sector Diversification** : Ensure the portfolio spans multiple industries.

#### **b. Factor Investing**

- Tilt the portfolio toward factors with higher risk-adjusted returns historically, such as:
  - Value
  - Momentum
  - Quality
  - Low Volatility

#### **c. Mean-Variance Optimization**

- Use modern portfolio theory (MPT) to find the optimal balance of assets that maximizes return for a given level of risk.

#### **d. Risk Parity**

- Allocate capital such that each asset contributes equally to overall portfolio risk.

### **Behavioral Considerations**

#### **a. Avoid Overfitting**

- Ensure models and strategies are generalizable by using walk-forward optimization and cross-validation.

#### **b. Stay Disciplined**

- Stick to risk limits and strategy parameters, even during periods of underperformance.

#### **c. Continuous Learning**

- Adapt to market changes by revisiting models and incorporating new data sources or techniques.

By systematically addressing both return enhancement and risk minimization, you can significantly improve the Sharpe ratio of your portfolio.

### 评论 #40 (作者: 顾问 ZH78994 (Rank 11), 时间: 1年前)

To increase alpha return, the key is enhancing the strategy’s ability to generate excess returns over a benchmark.

1. **Improving Return Predictions**:  

   - **Short-term Data**: Leverage real-time data such as price-volume trends, sentiment analysis, and news to capture short-term market movements. These can provide early signals for profitable trades.

   - **Long-term Data**: Use fundamental analysis, such as company earnings, financial ratios, and analyst reports, to identify undervalued or overvalued assets, capturing alpha from long-term mispricing.

2. **Model Complexity Trade-offs**:  

   - **Simple Models**: These are generally more robust and less prone to overfitting but might result in more conservative returns. They work well in unstable or uncertain environments.

   - **Complex Models**: While these can lead to higher returns, they carry the risk of overfitting, meaning they might not generalize well to future data, ultimately diminishing long-term alpha.

Balancing these factors effectively can enhance alpha while managing risk.

This post offers a solid overview of key strategies for increasing  **Alpha Return**  and managing  **Volatility**  in trading. It's important to balance the use of short-term data, like price-volume trends or news, with long-term indicators such as fundamentals and analyst reports to create a more holistic approach. As mentioned, the trade-off between model complexity and robustness is crucial—simpler models might not generate the highest returns but offer more stability, while complex models can lead to higher returns at the risk of overfitting.

The idea of  **neutralization strategies**  is particularly valuable when considering how to reduce volatility by minimizing exposure to market-wide or sector-specific risks.

I would be interested in hearing more about practical approaches to  **neutralization**  and how to identify and measure these risks effectively. Also, does anyone have recommendations on educational resources or forums that provide deeper insights into these strategies?

Alpha measures the excess performance of an investment compared to a benchmark. To improve Alpha, investors need better predictions by combining short-term data (e.g., price-volume trends and market news) with long-term data (e.g., financial reports and analyst insights). Additionally, they must balance simple models (more robust but less detailed) and complex models (higher accuracy but prone to overfitting). For example, if stock A rises after positive news (short-term data), you might buy to capture quick gains. Later, if the company’s financial reports indicate strong long-term growth potential (long-term data), you decide to hold the stock for maximum returns.
