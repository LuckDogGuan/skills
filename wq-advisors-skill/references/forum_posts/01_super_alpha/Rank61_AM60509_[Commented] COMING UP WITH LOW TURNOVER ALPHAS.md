Here are some structured ideas for crafting low-turnover alphas:

### **1. Valuation-Based Alpha**

**Concept:** 
Stocks with attractive valuation metrics tend to outperform over the long term.

#### Steps:

1. **Inputs:**  Use fundamental data such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-book (P/B), EV/EBITDA, and maybe Earnings per share ratios.
2. **Signal Construction:**  Rank stocks based on the inverse of these metrics (lower is better).For instance,            ValuationSignal = −P/E Ratio
3. You can try to use a multi-quarter average of the valuation metric to smooth out anomalies.

### **2. Earnings Growth Consistency**

**Concept:** 
Companies with consistent earnings growth often sustain their performance over time.

#### Steps:

1. **Inputs:**  Use quarterly EPS (earnings per share) growth data.
2. **Signal Construction:**  Calculate the standard deviation of EPS growth over the past few quarters. Rank stocks based on lower standard deviations. GrowthStabilitySignal = −StdDev(EPSGrowth)
3. **Combine:**  Add a filter for stocks with positive earnings growth to exclude declining performers.

Stable earnings growth often translates into predictable stock returns, reducing the need for frequent rebalancing.

### **3. Dividend Yield Stability**

**Concept:** 
Stocks with stable or growing dividends tend to attract long-term investors, creating consistent price support.

#### Steps:

1. **Inputs:**  Use dividend yield and dividend payout ratios.
2. **Signal Construction:**  Rank stocks based on dividend yield, adjusted for payout ratio stability. DividendSignal = DividendYield×(1−StdDev(PayoutRatio))
3. **Sector Neutrality:**  Adjust for sector biases, as dividend yields vary significantly across industries.

### **4. Long-Term Momentum**

**Concept:** 
Stocks with strong performance over long horizons (e.g., 12 months) often continue to perform well.

#### Steps:

1. **Inputs:**  Use 12-month price returns, excluding the most recent month to avoid short-term reversals.
2. **Signal Construction:**  LongTermMomentum=(Price(t​)−Price(t−12M​))/Price(t−12M​​)
3. **Normalization:**  Normalize across the universe to ensure comparability.

Momentum signals based on longer horizons require less frequent rebalancing, inherently lowering turnover.

### **5. Capital Efficiency**

**Concept:** 
Firms that efficiently utilize capital for growth are rewarded over the long term.

#### Steps:

1. **Inputs:**  Use ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) and WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital).
2. **Signal Construction:**  EfficiencySignal=ROIC−WACC

Capital-efficient companies exhibit enduring advantages, reducing the need for frequent adjustments.

### **General Best Practices for Low Turnover Alphas**

1. **Long Lookback Windows:**  Use longer periods (e.g., 1–3 years) for data calculations to reduce signal volatility.
2. **Signal Smoothing:**  Apply exponential moving averages (EMAs) or rolling averages to smooth noisy signals.
3. **Cross-Sectional Neutralization:**  Rank signals across the universe to avoid drastic changes due to market-wide movements.
4. **Transaction Cost Analysis:**  Optimize rebalancing frequency by balancing predictive power against trading costs.
5. **Risk Management:**  Neutralize market, sector, and also try risk-based neutralization factors like slow,fast, and slow and fast factors

Creating low-turnover alphas requires designing signals that emphasize stable, persistent patterns rather than short-term fluctuations.

To create low-turnover alphas, focus on stable patterns by:

1. Using fundamental metrics like earnings or book-to-market ratios.
2. Smoothing signals with moving averages.
3. Targeting persistent trends like cross-sectional momentum or mean reversion.
4. Extending holding periods for steady signals.
5. Neutralizing noise with sector/market adjustments.

Capital efficiency, measured by  **ROIC - WACC** , reflects a firm's ability to generate returns above its cost of capital. Firms with high efficiency signals often possess sustainable advantages like superior management or resource allocation. These characteristics result in more consistent performance over time, reducing the need for frequent portfolio adjustments. By targeting capital-efficient companies, low-turnover alphas can capture stable, long-term value creation while minimizing transaction costs and noise.

謝謝分享這篇有關低_turnover alphas的帖子！我想新增一些想法到這個列表中。首先，想要講的是低_turnover alphas的設計需要強調穩定和持久的模式，而不是短期的波動。因此，選擇適合的信號建設方法和輸入資料非常重要。

其次，對於valuation-based alpha的部分，可以考慮使用更複雜的估值指標，例如使用多個季度的平均數據来平滑異常值。同時，也可以嘗試將其他的估值指標，如股息率、資產回報率等纳入評估中。

另外，對於長期動量的部分，可以考慮使用不同的時間窗口，例如6個月、12個月等，來觀察股票的長期表現。同時，也可以嘗試使用其他的動量指標，例如相對強度指數（RSI），来評估股票的長期趨勢。

最後，對於風險管理的部分，可以考慮使用更多的風險 нейтралізація因子，如市值、行業等，來降低 alphs 的風險。同時，也可以嘗試使用機器學習算法來優化 alphs 的表現。

希望這些想法能够對大家有所幫助！

Hi ,

The general format of trade_when operator is the following :

Trade_When (x=triggerTradeExp, y=AlphaExp, z=triggerExitExp)

z / triggerExitExp is basically the exit condition for the alpha . triggerExitExp = -1 means that the positions taken will not be exited .

Please do refer to the following page where you would find a more detailed explanation of the trade_when operator :

Hi!

> Could you please give an example of how to "Hold alpha can be replaced by decaying alpha linearly or exponentially"? thank you

Let's say event_condition is a particular condition you're interested in, and alpha_expression is the alpha you want to decay.

Now, your expression could look like this:

```
event_condition? alpha_expression : (alpha_expression + trade_when(event_condition, alpha_expression, -1))/2
```

In this configuration, if 'event_condition' is true, we take the 'alpha_expression' value. If it's false, we average the current 'alpha_expression' value and the 'alpha_expression' value at the time of the last event. This gradually decays the alpha.

You can also use 'days_from_last_change(event_condition)' to assign more or less weight to the 'old' alpha expression, controlling the rate of decay.

> What is event_condition , please explain with an alpha as example.

An example of event_condition could be something like (rank(volume/adv20) > 0.5). So the alpha will be executed when the rank of the ratio of  `volume`  to  `adv20`  exceeds 0.5.

So, an example alpha expression with event_condition might look like:

```
trade_when(rank(volume/adv20) > 0.5, pcr_oi_all, -1)
```

To create low-turnover alphas, one can use signals like valuation ratios (P/E, P/B), earnings growth stability, and dividend yield consistency. These signals help identify stocks with attractive valuations, stable growth, and sustainable dividends, reducing short-term fluctuations. Metrics like EPS volatility or adjusted dividend yield enhance stability in the strategy, focusing on long-term performance rather than short-term market noise.

### 评论 #17 (作者: TN51777, 时间: 1年前)

It’s also essential to smooth signals using moving averages and extend lookback periods (1-3 years) to reduce volatility. Additionally, adjusting for market and sector biases helps avoid sudden shifts due to broader market movements. Analyzing transaction costs and managing risks are key to optimizing rebalancing frequency and maintaining long-term alpha efficiency.

ETL Optimization is a portfolio optimization method that controls tail risk, making it suitable for highly volatile markets like crypto, commodities, or emerging markets. However, it requires significant computational resources and is unnecessary for stable markets. To enhance performance, ETL can be combined with Machine Learning, Mean-Variance, or Risk Parity to balance returns and risks.

You can try approaching alpha decay using either linear or exponential methods by applying dynamic weights based on  `days_from_last_change(event_condition)` . Another approach is to combine it with rolling decay using EMA to control the influence of past signals. This can help the alpha gradually fade over time while preserving its dynamic characteristics.

One effective way to manage turnover is by combining  **trade_when()**  with  **dynamic decay settings** . Instead of a fixed decay rate, you can adjust it based on market conditions using  **days_from_last_change()** . This allows the alpha to retain signals longer when trends persist and decay faster when signals weaken. Additionally,  **hump()**  can help control turnover by smoothing signal transitions, reducing unnecessary trading. A practical approach could be applying an adaptive decay factor that scales with volatility or liquidity to optimize rebalancing frequency.

Creating low-turnover alphas sounds great! Your breakdown of valuation-based alpha and the focus on stable patterns really resonated with me. Since I'm still learning the ropes as a newbie in this field, I appreciate your insights on ranking based on metrics like P/E and smoothing signals. It's helpful to know that incorporating things like dividend yield stability or long-term momentum can lead to better performance over time. Can't wait to experiment with these strategies and see how they play out in my own analyses! Thanks for sharing such detailed and practical ideas!

### 评论 #33 (作者: 顾问 NT32626 (Rank 80), 时间: 1年前)

An interesting way to optimize low-turnover alphas is by combining factors such as capital efficiency (ROIC - WACC) with a long-term cycle model (e.g., 12 months) to maintain signal stability. This can minimize the impact of short-term fluctuations while preserving long-term stability. Additionally, incorporating signal decay adjustments (using exponential or linear decay depending on the nature of the event) can help reduce unnecessary volatility and increase the reliability of predictions.

### 评论 #36 (作者: VL52770, 时间: 1年前)

To build low-turnover alphas, in addition to using fundamental metrics and smoothing signals with methods like moving averages, another important factor is optimizing the strategy over time. For example, you could try combining long-term signals such as 12-month momentum or stability in earnings growth to reduce sensitivity to short-term fluctuations. Additionally, using tools like "trade_when" or "ts_target_tvr_hump" along with transaction cost-reduction methods can help control turnover rates without compromising strategy effectiveness. It may also be worth applying risk-adjustment factors such as sector or market neutrality to ensure that alphas are not overly impacted by broad market movements.

Another approach to balancing predictive power and transaction costs is using adaptive holding periods. Instead of maintaining a fixed holding period, we can adjust it dynamically based on signal persistence—for example, using a rolling Sharpe ratio or dynamic decay signals to determine the optimal exit timing. This helps maintain alpha effectiveness while minimizing unnecessary trading.

Thank you for sharing these detailed methods for building low-turnover alphas! One additional consideration is using adaptive holding periods—rather than fixing the holding time, we can adjust it based on signal stability. For example, if an alpha signal remains strong over multiple periods, extending the holding time can reduce turnover while maintaining performance. Additionally, incorporating entropy-based weighting can help control the impact of risk factors, making the alpha more sustainable in the long run.

Several comments discuss dividend stability as a foundation for low-turnover alpha strategies. This makes sense because high-yield, stable dividend stocks tend to attract long-term investors, leading to less price volatility. However, an issue arises when comparing dividend yields across sectors, some industries naturally have higher yields than others. One solution is sector-neutral ranking, where dividend yields are compared within each industry rather than across the entire market.
