## 帖子正文

something i would like to know from others if they too are struggling to make 4 alphas of high quality because earlier i used to make 1 or 2 alphas a day with good quality because i could give some time to make these alphas but now since we need to make 4 alphas a day to keep up with the genius program i am not able to make alphas of same quality, it's the dilemma of quantity or quality that i am going through, if someone is able to do both do let me know how much time you are giving to make each alpha.

In my case, I dedicate 3-4 hours per day.

With Genius, you don't need to submit 4 Regulars and 1 Super every day. Even if you're aiming for GrandMaster level, the requirement is only 220 Alphas in a quarter (~90 days).
This means you'll need to submit an average of 2.44 Alphas per day.
Supers are usually quite easy, so you'll only need to submit 1-2 quality Regulars each day.

I usually spend more time on Communication Activity, also around 2-3 hours. 
Therefore, I often combine research and working on Alphas with CA.

You can create an alpha based on a quality expression and then use the tool to improve the sharper signals which can help you reduce the time. Here is an example of a basic tool.

```

Hi  [SM36732](/hc/en-us/profiles/4935556279831-SM36732) , I usually spend 3-4 hours daily on Alphas. With Genius, you don’t need to submit 4 Regulars and 1 Super every day—GrandMaster level requires 220 Alphas per quarter, averaging 2.44 per day. Supers are easier, so focusing on 1-2 quality Regulars is enough. I also balance my time with Communication Activity, often combining research and Alpha development to maintain both quality and quantity.

### 评论 #5 (作者: 顾问 DL53864 (Rank 98), 时间: 1年前)

You can create some high-quality alpha templates based on previously submitted alphas, then develop a tool to search for alphas using these templates. I think this could significantly reduce your alpha research time. Additionally, submitting more supers can help increase the number of alphas. If your goal is Master or lower levels, you only need around 120 alphas in ~90 days, so even if you create just 1–2 high-quality alphas, you should still have more than enough to meet the criteria for this level

**Text Preprocessing** : Use libraries like  **NLTK**  or  **spaCy**  for removing stop words, special characters, and normalizing text. For financial data, consider extracting sentiment scores or keywords.

This alpha strategy is particularly well-suited for  **sector-neutral**  or  **subindustry-neutral**  portfolio construction, which is important for strategies that aim to remain diversified while targeting alpha. By avoiding bias towards any specific subindustry, the strategy ensures that the portfolio remains balanced.

Depending on your goals, you can reduce the pressure of the number of alphas to submit. For example, if the target for Master is around 120 alphas in 90 days, you could focus on preparing 1-2 truly high-quality alphas each day. Over-focusing on quantity can lead to a significant decrease in your Combined Alpha Performance.

- **Risk Management** : Learn about risk metrics such as  **Value at Risk (VaR)** ,  **Sharpe Ratio** , and  **Maximum Drawdown**  to assess and manage the risks of your models.
- **Asset Pricing Models** : Understand models like the  **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**  and the  **Fama-French Three-Factor Model** . These help in estimating expected returns based on the relationship between an asset’s risk and its return.

To reach Master, aim for  **1-2 high-quality alphas daily**  rather than maximizing quantity. Submitting ~120 alphas in 90 days is manageable, but prioritizing quality prevents a drop in  **Combined Alpha Performance** .

**Interest Rates and Central Bank Policies** : Pay close attention to ECB (European Central Bank) policies, rate hikes/cuts, and forward guidance. Operators that leverage interest rate expectations, like  **interest rate differentials**  between the EUR and other currencies (USD, GBP), can be potent.

It’s definitely a challenge to maintain both quantity and quality while creating alphas. If someone is successfully achieving both, I’d imagine they’re likely using a streamlined process or focusing on simpler models that still offer strong performance. Maybe leveraging automated tools or pre-existing frameworks could help speed up the process without sacrificing the quality. How do you currently approach each alpha—do you have a set structure, or is it more exploratory?

### 评论 #15 (作者: TD84322, 时间: 1年前)

Balancing quality and quantity in alpha creation is challenging. If you're making four alphas daily, try using templates, refining existing ideas, and automating tests. Allocating time efficiently per alpha can help maintain quality.

### 评论 #16 (作者: DP11917, 时间: 1年前)

**Backtest the Alphas** : Use backtesting tools (such as Zipline or QuantConnect) to test the predictive power of your alphas. Validate them across different timeframes and regions to ensure they hold up under different market conditions.

I think there is no need to submit 4 regular and 1 super alpha daily With Genius Because to reach GandMaster level requires 220 Alphas per quarter(90 days), which means a maximum of 3 alpha per day will be more than enough than required. so focus on quality not in quantity.

Hey, I totally get where you're coming from! Balancing quantity and quality in alpha creation is such a challenge. I used to feel the pressure of producing multiple alphas daily, but then I realized that focusing on 1-2 high-quality alphas has worked wonders for my results. The key is to perhaps use templates from previous successful alphas and automate parts of your research process. That way, you can still produce 4 alphas a day without sacrificing their quality. If you're consistently finding it hard, maybe it's time to reassess how much time you're dedicating to each alpha. Good luck, and remember that quality can really set you apart in this game!

### 评论 #21 (作者: NP85445, 时间: 1年前)

Balancing quality and quantity is definitely a challenge. I've found that rather than trying to craft 4 entirely new, high-quality alphas every day, it's more effective to develop a few robust templates that you can refine and slightly tweak. This way, you maintain your quality while still hitting your daily targets. I personally aim for 1-2 top-tier alphas and then supplement with 1-2 additional ideas that can be iterated on later. Experiment with automating parts of your research and backtesting to speed up the process, and remember that quality should always be the priority—even if it means occasionally falling a bit short of the 4-per-day goal.

### 评论 #22 (作者: TT55495, 时间: 1年前)

Create high-quality alpha templates from previous submissions and build a tool to search using them, saving research time. Submitting more supers can increase your alphas. For Master or lower levels, 120 alphas in 90 days is enough, so 1–2 high-quality alphas should meet the criteria.

### 评论 #23 (作者: QG16026, 时间: 1年前)

What strategies or tools do you use to balance high quality with the required quantity of producing 4 alphas a day? For example, do you rely on templates or automation to streamline your process, and how do you allocate your time per alpha?

---

### 评论 #24 (作者: TD28355, 时间: 1年前)

You can optimize both quantity and quality by:

- **Using alpha templates**  from previous good models instead of creating new ones from scratch.
- **Automating**  correlation checks and alpha filtering with scripts to save time.
- **Focusing on quality** : Create 1-2 strong alphas, while keeping the rest simple for future improvements.
- **Leveraging Super Alphas**  to boost your count more easily.
- **Managing time efficiently** , spending 3-4 hours a day and combining research with alpha development.

### 评论 #25 (作者: AB15407, 时间: 1年前)

I'm in the same situation as you!
Currently, I can only manage to create 1-2 Alphas per day, and I spend 2-3 hours on it. If I don't find a good solution, I won't qualify for GrandMaster.
I need to think further, maybe a more realistic goal for me is to reach Master level!

### 评论 #26 (作者: HN71281, 时间: 1年前)

Balancing quantity and quality in alpha generation is challenging. One approach is  **streamlining idea generation**  by leveraging automation, predefined factor templates, and efficient backtesting. Allocating  **focused time per alpha (e.g., 1-2 hours each)**  while refining the best-performing ones later can help.

### 评论 #27 (作者: PT27687, 时间: 1年前)

It sounds like you're facing a common challenge in balancing quantity with quality. Finding that sweet spot where you can produce multiple high-quality alphas could be tough, especially with the increase in volume. Have you thought about any specific strategies for improving your efficiency, or maybe creating a template for the alphas that could save you some time? It would be interesting to hear how others are navigating this as well!

### 评论 #28 (作者: VN28696, 时间: 1年前)

Yeah, making 4 alphas a day can definitely hurt quality. I usually use templates, tweak old alphas, and focus on less competitive datasets. Takes me around 1-2 hours per alpha. Thanks for sharing, would love to hear how others manage!

Balancing quantity and quality in alpha creation is indeed a common challenge, especially with the increased expectations from the Genius program. It might be beneficial to explore strategies for streamlining the research process, such as leveraging data analysis tools or focusing on specific niches that align with your strengths. How do others prioritize their research topics to maintain quality while meeting the daily alpha requirements?
