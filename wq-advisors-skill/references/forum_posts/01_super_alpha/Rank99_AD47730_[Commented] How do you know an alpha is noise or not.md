Hello guys,

I would want to know how to determine if a regular alpha is noise or if it's indeed a good alpha.

First of all, if an alpha has exceptionally high Sharpe and high turnover, let's say 30%+, is it a noise one rather robust signal?

What properties do I need to check in mt alpha to mark it as noise and try another idea, more so when I am using an  **LLM** to create it?

Let me hear your take on this!

One of the ways to think about “noise vs signal” in alphas is  **Stability beats peak Sharpe:** 
A noisy alpha often shows:

- Sharpe that collapses across subperiods (regime dependence)
- Large variance in performance month-to-month
- Good in-sample, weak out-of-sample or rather Good in Train, Poor in Test period.

A more robust signal tends to have  *moderate but consistent*  Sharpe across time slices, assets, and market regimes.

High Sharpe + high turnover isn’t automatically noise

**A very high Sharpe with high turnover is often just noise unless it keeps working after transaction costs and on new unseen data. If the alpha is stable across different periods and small changes, it’s likely a real signal and not random luck.**

High Sharpe with very high turnover often signals overfitting or microstructure noise. Check stability across periods, decay consistency, correlation with existing alphas, robustness after costs, universe changes, and out-of-sample performance.

High sharpe and high turnover but it decay in os or its last year sharpe is unusual high.

High Sharpe + 30% turnover is not automatically noise, but it’s a red flag.

I’d check a few things first: does it work across years, does it survive small parameter changes, does the logic make sense without the formula, and is the PnL coming from many names or just a few lucky trades?

Good points, HFT is a case like that, with high Sharpe and turnover. It actually captures recurring market patterns, so it's not just noise.

But the same pattern would show up if your data has some bias issue, e.g. look ahead issue. So, always, we gotta rule out bias first. :)

To add on the points, you can also know your is good when its maintain its perfomance metrics after rank or sign it . ie rank(alpha) or sign(alpha)

i think if the RA has good pnl and return will be good

Thank you for starting this crucial discussion! With the rise of LLM-assisted alpha generation, distinguishing true economic signals from random backtest noise is more critical than ever. The points raised in the comments about sub-period consistency and testing across different universes are incredibly helpful benchmarks for all of us. I appreciate the great insights shared here!

IC consistency across rolling periods is your primary diagnostic. Calculate IC on rolling 3-month windows across your backtest. Genuine signal shows consistently positive rolling IC with moderate variance — the signal works repeatedly across different market periods.
