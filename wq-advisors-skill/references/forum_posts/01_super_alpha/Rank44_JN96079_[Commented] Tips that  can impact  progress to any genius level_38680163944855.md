To make a process smart work and persistence is required.

Lets dive deep in tips that i used to move from gold level to expert level within one month of understanding what is needed.

- Navigating through all my datasets, identify datafields with high coverage , >60%.
- Identifying what are the new datafields that i have not used and have higher coverage.
- Navigating through all my operators, learn their format and what realistic lookback days work best.
- Combining new datafields with some new operators.
- Coming up with new models from my pool daily. In my models i considered several metrics of which were my target. e.g

1. *A model should have one or two datafieldsMy datafield per alpha shall be as low as 2*
2. *A model should have five , four or less operators. This reduce operator per alpha which is also a measure seem considered in level. Most masters and grandmaster have low as 3 operators per alpha.*
3. *A model should have a sharp greater than 2 on IS,TRAIN and TEST for regular and super should be 3.*
4. *Avoid overfitting, ensuring my sharp on IS,TEST and TRAIN are somehow similar.*
5. *Low correlations*
6. *The ration between returns and drawdown shall be greater tha 2*
7. *A model should have higher margin above 10%*
8. *Focusing on quality over quantity*
9. *My daily models should be total different.*
10. *My models should atleats cover four regions.*

*On super alpha i came up with some combos that definately have masive impact on my alphas. here are some*

1. days_from_last_change(ts_min(combo_a(alpha, nlength=40, mode='algo4'),100))
2. stats=generate_stats(alpha);
   innerCorr=self_corr(stats.returns,81);
   ic=max(innerCorr==1.0,nan,innerCorr);
   maxCorr=reduce_norm(ic);
   1-maxCorr

This is a fantastic breakdown of a disciplined approach to alpha development! I particularly resonate with the emphasis on datafield coverage and minimizing operators per alpha, as these are crucial for robust and generalizable strategies. One question that comes to mind is how you approach identifying the "realistic lookback days" for your operators – is this primarily through brute-force testing, or do you have a more theoretical framework for choosing those initial ranges?

### 评论 #7 (作者: JZ16161, 时间: 3个月前)

To avoid overfitting, i make sure my TEST and TRAIN metrics are almost the same.

On lookback days, they are less two years , days <730 and they should be somehow fit a month, 2month ,3.... e.g 124, these are 4months ending with 31days each.

To ensure diversity i ensure i use new models most days with one datafield new, the change of neutralization , use diffrent groupdatafields, submitting in more than 4 regions.

On feature selection , decay most is less than 5, test period 2yrs, most of my codes are max trade on.

### 评论 #40 (作者: KP26017, 时间: 3个月前)

Really valuable breakdown and the progression from gold to expert in one month is impressive — clearly came from structured thinking rather than random experimentation.

The framework you've laid out is essentially a discipline checklist and that's exactly what separates consistent performers from people who get lucky occasionally. A few things stand out as particularly sharp:

**The constraint-based model design is underrated.**  Capping yourself at 2 datafields and 4-5 operators forces you to find genuinely clean signal rather than masking noise with complexity. Most people do the opposite — add operators hoping something sticks. Your approach inverts that instinct correctly.

### 评论 #41 (作者: HT71201, 时间: 3个月前)

Your focus on data coverage, operator discipline, and simple model structures really stands out. I’m especially curious about how you ensure daily models are truly different—how do you create that diversity while still maintaining strong quality metrics?
