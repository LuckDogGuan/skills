I’ve been wondering whether alpha performance is driven more by choosing the right dataset or by applying the right transformations/operators. In your experience, which contributes more to finding robust signals?

Thank you, and I’m looking forward to your feedback.

both. But correct implementation makes you more confident in your research

A good operator can clean up a signal, but it usually can’t rescue a dataset or field with no real information. If the field has strong behavior, even simple transforms like rank, ts_rank, delta, or neutralization can work.

Yeah, that's right, what has been mentioned by  [PT58185](/hc/en-us/profiles/35773074046487-PT58185)  and  [CW62782](/hc/en-us/profiles/34536778058903-CW62782) . Moreso, you can try starting with dataset selection, then, when you are more confident with how you do research, try any dataset at random along the way.

I think both are equally important.
