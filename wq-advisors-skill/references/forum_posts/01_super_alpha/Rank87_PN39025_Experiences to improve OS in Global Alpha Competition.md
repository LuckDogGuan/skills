Hi everyone, I am participating in the Global Alpha Competition but do not have much experience to achieve a high OS score. I hope to hear from everyone to improve. Thank you everyone.

You are looking to improve yourOSscore in theGlobal Alpha Competitionbut have limited experience. Focus on optimizing trading strategies, implementing strict risk management, and experimenting with multiple models. Additionally, analyze your backtest results to identify strengths and weaknesses, and apply factor neutralization techniques to boost performance.

If you are aiming to improve your OS score in the Global Alpha Competition, it helps to approach it systematically. First, study the characteristics of past high-OS alphas — they often have low production correlation, consistent performance across different universes, and stable predictive signals. Avoid overfitting to IS by testing your designs on multiple time periods and universes. You can also experiment with orthogonal datasets or transformations that create unique, low-correlation signals, since OS rewards novelty and robustness. Another tip is to iterate in small steps: start with a simple, strong core idea, then refine it with meaningful adjustments rather than adding unnecessary complexity. Finally, monitor your submission history to identify patterns in what tends to yield higher OS for you personally, and adjust your design focus accordingly. Over time, you’ll build an intuition for which ideas translate well into high-OS alphas.

Improving OS in the Global Alpha Competition often comes down to balancing three elements: robustness, diversity, and simplicity. First, always validate that your signals generalize across time—operators likets_decay_linear,hump, orts_meanhelp smooth noise and prevent your factor from being overly fitted to short-term fluctuations. Second, focus on cross-sectional stability: applyingnormalizeorgroup_neutralizeensures your factor behaves consistently across different industries and countries, which is critical for global universes. Another overlooked aspect is alpha diversity—if your alphas are too correlated, even strong IS results won’t translate into stable OS performance. Try building signals on different themes (valuation, liquidity, sentiment, risk), then combine them using Super Alpha selection rules with correlation constraints. Lastly, don’t ignore turnover—sometimes reducing trading frequency slightly can improve OS significantly by lowering noise and execution sensitivity. In short: build smoother signals, diversify sources, and manage correlation for stronger OS.

Focus on robust feature engineering and simple models that generalize well across different market conditions. Avoid overfitting by using proper time series validation and always test on truly out-of-sample data.
