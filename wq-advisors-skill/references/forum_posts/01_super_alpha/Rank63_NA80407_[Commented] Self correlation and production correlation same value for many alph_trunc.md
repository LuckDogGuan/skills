Hi  [SK78969](/hc/en-us/profiles/1531055428142-SK78969) ,

There is one scenario where  **self-correlation**  and  **production correlation**  can be the same:

If the alpha you are submitting ( **Alpha1** ) is both  **highly self-correlated**  and  **highly correlated with an alpha already in production**  ( **Alpha2** ).

To confirm this, click on the  **details**  of the  **self-correlation**  and  **production correlation**  metrics.

### **Example:**

- You are submitting  **Alpha1** .
- You have already submitted  **Alpha2** , which is in production.
- Assume when you check  **both self-correlation and production correlation for Alpha1** , they both show  **0.85** .

This means:

- The highest  **self-correlated**  alpha to  **Alpha1**  is  **Alpha2**  with a correlation of  **0.85** .
- The highest  **production-correlated**  alpha to  **Alpha1**  is also  **Alpha2** , with the same  **0.85**  correlation.

Thus, in this case,  **self-correlation and production correlation refer to the same alpha (Alpha2).**

Hi  [SK78969](/hc/en-us/profiles/1531055428142-SK78969) ,

I think the production correlation value includes both my alphas and those of other consultants. Therefore, there will be cases where the self-correlation and the production correlation values are the same.

hi, because prod corr includes your alphas in it. If prod corr = self corr then it means your current alpha is most highly correlated with an alpha you submitted.

[SK78969](/hc/en-us/profiles/1531055428142-SK78969)  that mostly happens to me when i make a very low correlation alpha and then try to make a similar alpha so my alpha is highly correlated to my own alpha leading to same self and prod correlation

**Advanced Signal Generation and Optimization Strategies**

1. **Uncommon Operators (vector_neut, vector_proj, regression_neut, regression_proj):**
   - **Impact:**  Reduce correlation, improve Sharpe ratios, and isolate unique signals for enhanced alpha specificity.
   - **Best Use:**  Works best with structured datasets (e.g., price-volume, fundamentals).
   - **Example:**  Neutralizing signals against market benchmarks or sector trends to remove common exposures.
2. **Group Operators (group_coalesce, group_cartesian_product):**
   - **Impact:**  Create diverse signals, improve model fitness, and enhance stability by leveraging custom neutralizations and unique data combinations.
   - **Best Use:**  Effective for hierarchical data (e.g., industries, regions, ESG metrics).
   - **Example:**  Grouping signals by industry or region to build more resilient and diversified alpha strategies.
3. **Underutilized Datasets:**
   - **Impact:**  Generate novel alphas with higher Sharpe ratios by tapping into niche or alternative datasets with unique return profiles.
   - **Best Use:**  Alternative data sources like satellite imagery, credit card transactions, or specialized macroeconomic datasets.

**Overall:**  These strategies help uncover unique signals, reduce correlation, and improve alpha performance by optimizing data relationships—providing a solid framework for advancing alpha research.

Hello SK78969,

In the case where you notice that the self-correlation and production correlation values are the same during the development of your alpha, this could happen due to several reasons:

1. **Unique Alpha in the Pool** : If your alpha is unique within your alpha pool and also similar in the overall alpha pool (for example, when there is an overlap of ideas with other consultants), then the self-correlation and production correlation might coincide. This means that your alpha does not have significant differences compared to other alphas in the system.
2. **Lack of Diversity in Ideas** : If your alpha is based on an idea that is too common or simple, it could lead to many people developing similar alphas, resulting in overlapping correlations.

### Ways to Improve:

To minimize this situation, you can try the following methods:

Use Correlation Adjustment Operator: **hump, ts_target_tvr_hump, ts_target_tvr_delta_limit, hump_decay, trade_when**

The fact that self-correlation and production correlation are the same could be a sign that your alpha needs improvement to become more unique. By using adjustment operators and changing the idea, you can minimize overlap and increase the effectiveness of the alpha. Wishing you success in developing your alpha!

### **1. Reduce Turnover Spikes Efficiently**

- **Monitor Moving Averages of Turnover:**
  - Use a  **30-day moving average**  to smooth out turnover trends.
  - Identify and  **reduce extreme spikes**  using an outlier detection method like  **Z-score filtering** .

### 评论 #8 (作者: NH84459, 时间: 1年前)

- If your alpha strategy is  **not influenced by market structure changes**  (e.g., stable correlations over time), self-correlation and production correlation can be similar.
- This often happens when  **market regimes do not change significantly**  between backtest and live trading periods.

**Review Account Limits:**  Double-check the specific usage limits for fundamental operators in your account. It might be possible that there's a temporary restriction or update needed, even though you’re under the 10% usage mark.

### 评论 #10 (作者: SG91420, 时间: 1年前)

A number of factors regarding your model and the alpha signals you're working with may become apparent when you observe that, for many Alphas, the values of self-correlation and production correlation are the same following simulation. 
A single alpha's internal relationship is usually measured via self-correlation. Your alpha is very consistent in its predictions over time if it shows a high level of self-correlation. This may indicate that there is insufficient diversity in the alpha or that it is repeatedly engaging in the same behaviour.
2. Production Correlation: This measures how well your alpha's signals align with the actual portfolio construction If the production correlation is the same as the self-correlation, it might imply that the strategy is replicating its internal structure or behavior directly in the final portfolio.

### 评论 #11 (作者: ND68030, 时间: 1年前)

If the alpha exhibits strong mean reversion or follows a cyclical pattern, its self-correlation and production correlation may appear identical due to minimal signal variation over time. Additionally, a simplistic alpha or one with a fixed lag could also cause this phenomenon. It would be useful to test across different time frames or introduce noise to verify the root cause

Hey I think it is normal because those ideas you are working on are kind of unique, only you have them and that's why max prod corr is the same as max self corr.

**System Update:**  If the system isn't updating correctly, it might be a technical glitch. Ensure that any updates or system recalibrations have been completed on your account. You may want to reach out to the support team to confirm this.

### 评论 #14 (作者: DN76271, 时间: 1年前)

Yeah, this can happen due to a few reasons:

1. **Stable signal across time**  – If your alpha’s structure doesn’t change much, both correlations may end up the same.
2. **Minimal data leakage or overfitting**  – If your alpha isn’t picking up short-term noise, its correlation stays stable.
3. **Lack of external dependencies**  – If it relies only on internal signals and not market shifts, correlation values may remain unchanged.

### 评论 #15 (作者: AC63290, 时间: 1年前)

When self correlation and production correlation values are identical, it typically indicates one of two scenarios:

1. Your alpha is highly stable and consistent across different time periods
2. There might be a technical issue with the correlation check system - try rechecking at a different time or clearing your cache.

Offering competitive pricing or value-added services can attract clients who might otherwise gravitate toward more established consultants. By demonstrating value in ways other than a streak, a new consultant can build trust quickly.

Have any example? Maybe screenshot or any...
I don't see this happening to me, For me, prod corr is always higher than self corr

It's just a lag. Try logging out and signing back in, then resimulate—it should disappear the same result and refresh

### 评论 #19 (作者: 顾问 TV43543 (Rank 4), 时间: 1年前)

In my opinion, since you previously submitted alpha based on the ideas of the majority, now, with those same ideas, your alpha remains nearly identical to the majority, so these two indexes will be nearly equal.

**Alternative Data and Traditional Data** : Incorporating alternative data like web traffic, social media mentions, or satellite data with traditional financial data can uncover new insights. For instance, a rise in Google search volume for a company could indicate future stock movement, or satellite imagery data can reveal retail store traffic.

### 评论 #21 (作者: TD17989, 时间: 1年前)

**Overfitting in Alpha Models** : If your alpha is too closely tied to the features or the data it’s trained on, the correlation might end up being high between the alpha and the production signal. Essentially, your alpha could be too dependent on the historical data, and the result might mirror the production signal, leading to similar correlation values.

### 评论 #22 (作者: PT27687, 时间: 1年前)

To me, it is normal because those ideas you are working on are kind of unique, only you have them and that may be why max production correlation is the same as max self correlation.

### 评论 #23 (作者: HN71281, 时间: 1年前)

This can happen if your alpha (Alpha1) is highly correlated with an existing alpha (Alpha2) in production. In this case, both  **self-correlation**  and  **production correlation**  will show the same value, as they are both referring to the same alpha. You can check the details of both metrics to confirm this.

### 评论 #24 (作者: TT55495, 时间: 1年前)

Providing competitive pricing or value-added services can help attract clients who might prefer established consultants. Showcasing value beyond a track record allows new consultants to build trust faster.

### Check Account Limits for Restrictions:

Make sure to review the specific usage limits for fundamental operators in your account. Even if you're below the 10% usage threshold, there could be a temporary restriction or an update required that’s affecting access. Verifying this can help identify any potential limitations.

### 评论 #26 (作者: CD94009, 时间: 1年前)

### **How to Improve**

- Diversify Alpha Logic:
  Use underutilized operators (e.g.,  `vector_proj` ,  `regression_neut` ) or datasets (e.g., alternative data like sentiment or satellite imagery) to isolate unique signals.
- Apply Correlation Adjustment:
  Tools like  `ts_target_tvr_hump` ,  `hump_decay` , or  `trade_when`  can reduce overlap by penalizing redundant exposures.
- Avoid Idea Replication:
  If Alpha1 is a variation of Alpha2, rebuild it with a fresh approach (e.g., different time horizons, neutralizations, or grouped logic like  `group_coalesce` ).
- Check for Technical Issues:
  If correlations remain identical despite adjustments, rule out system lag or caching errors by re-simulating or contacting support.

It's interesting to see how self correlation and production correlation can yield the same value in some cases. This might indicate that the alpha model is perfectly aligned with its performance metrics, suggesting a strong internal consistency. Have you explored whether this happens more frequently with certain types of alphas, or is it a common trend across all your tests?

---

### 评论 #28 (作者: RG43829, 时间: 1年前)

This can happen when your  **alpha**  is highly similar to a previously created alpha, making  **self and production correlation values identical** .  **Production correlation includes both your alphas and those of other consultants** , so when you create a  **low-correlation alpha**  and then a very similar one, it leads to matching values.

---

### 评论 #29 (作者: LN92324, 时间: 1年前)

Hi. It is quite normal for Self Correlation and Prod Correlation values ​​to be similar. This may happen because the alphas you have submitted share a similar idea, leading to the alphas you submit later being more correlated with your old alphas than with the alphas of other consultants. I think that if this corr is still at a good level, then you do not need to worry too much. In a similar case, if this corr is high (above 0.68 for example), you can consider looking for more new ideas to diversify your alphas.

### Understanding Self-Correlation and Production Correlation in Alpha Signals

When self-correlation and production correlation remain identical after simulation, it may reveal key insights about your alpha model.

- **Self-Correlation** : Measures the consistency of an alpha’s predictions over time. High values suggest repetitive behavior or low diversity in signals.
- **Production Correlation** : Evaluates how well the alpha’s signals align with actual portfolio construction. If it matches self-correlation, the strategy might be directly mirroring its internal structure.

### **Possible Causes**

1. **Stable Signal Over Time**  – If the alpha’s structure remains unchanged, both correlations may align.
2. **Minimal Data Leakage/Overfitting**  – Lack of short-term noise can keep correlation stable.
3. **Limited External Dependencies**  – If the alpha relies solely on internal signals, correlation values may remain unchanged.

Addressing these factors can enhance signal diversity and robustness.

### 评论 #31 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 1年前)

When analyzing your model and alpha signals, observing that the self-correlation and production correlation are the same post-simulation can reveal several key insights about your strategy.

1. **Self-Correlation** : This metric reflects how consistent the alpha's predictions are over time. A high self-correlation typically means the alpha repeats similar behavior consistently. However, this might signal a lack of diversity, indicating that the alpha might not be adapting to changing market conditions or is too narrow in its approach.
2. **Production Correlation** : This measures the alignment between the alpha’s signals and the actual portfolio construction. If the production correlation mirrors the self-correlation, it suggests that the alpha is directly influencing the portfolio in a predictable manner, potentially making the strategy too uniform or repetitive.

In your case, since the alpha you submitted previously aligns with the majority's ideas, it's possible that it hasn't evolved enough, leading to similar self-correlation and production correlation values. To differentiate your alpha, you could explore new ideas or enhance diversity in its construction.

How do you approach ensuring diversity in your alphas to avoid overly repetitive patterns?

Hi  [SK78969](/hc/en-us/profiles/1531055428142-SK78969) , It's intriguing that self and production correlation sometimes match. This could indicate strong internal consistency in your alpha. Have you noticed if this occurs more with specific types of alphas? It might also result from submitting highly similar alphas, leading to identical correlation values.
