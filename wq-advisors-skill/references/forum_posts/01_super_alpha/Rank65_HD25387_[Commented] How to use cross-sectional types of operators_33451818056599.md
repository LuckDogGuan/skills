I don't quite understand your question. What is the associative operator you are referring to here? Can you rephrase the question more clearly?

could you clarify what you mean by “combo type simulation” and “cross-sectional operators”? Are you referring to using multiple operator types in one setup?

**quantile(x, driver = gaussian, sigma = 1.0),**  **these type of methods in combo simulation.can u justify it.**

When running combo-type simulations, the main goal is to see whether a group of alphas works together more effectively than they do alone. A good starting tip is to combine alphas that have  **low correlation**  with each other, since diversity tends to improve stability. You can also experiment with mixing different styles of signals, for example blending momentum-based with valuation- or sentiment-based ones, so they balance across regimes. Neutralization (industry, country, or cap) helps keep combos from being dominated by broad biases. Finally, don’t just chase Sharpe — watch turnover, fitness, and stability across IS/OS windows to confirm the combo is robust.
