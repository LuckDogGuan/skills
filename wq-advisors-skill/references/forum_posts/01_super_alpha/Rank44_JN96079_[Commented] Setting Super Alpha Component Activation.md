Hello everyone, I would like to ask about the meaning of the Component Activation option when setting up a Super Alpha? What do IS and OS mean? Thanks you.

When using the IS option, the displayed performance is how your alpha performs with in-sample data. While working with OS, the displayed output showcases how your alpha would perform with out-of-sample data.

Any more knowledge and clarifications can be added!

Thanks.

- **Component Activation**  allows you to  **select which alpha components**  will be active (used) in the Super Alpha during different periods. This helps you analyze the  **contribution and stability**  of each component.
- **IS (In-Sample)**  refers to the training period — the time window used to  **optimize or fit**  the alpha.
- **OS (Out-of-Sample)**  refers to the testing period — used to  **validate performance**  and check for overfitting. Good alphas should perform well both in IS and OS.

💡  *Best practice* : Activate only components that are stable in IS and continue to show signal in OS. This reduces the risk of overfitting and increases the robustness of the Super Alpha.

This can help identify how the Alphas you selected perform in OS, but if all the selected Alphas are newly generated, then Component Activation ON will show no results. Here's an example using an ACE2023 Alpha(OS is after 2021):

Great question! The  **Component Activation**  setting lets you choose whether each individual alpha in your Super Alpha combo is active during the  **In-Sample (IS)**  or  **Out-of-Sample (OS)**  periods.

- **IS (In-Sample)** : The training period used to evaluate and optimize your alpha during construction.
- **OS (Out-of-Sample)** : The validation period used to test how well your alpha generalizes to new, unseen data.

By toggling Component Activation, you can see which alphas are actually contributing to performance in each period—helpful for spotting overfitting or identifying robust components. Hope that helps!

Thank you all for the clear explanations  really helpful! I now see how Component Activation can be used to detect overfitting and assess stability across periods.

Hello! The Component Activation option in Super Alpha setup lets you choose which base alphas are active during different periods.  **IS**  stands for "In-Sample," meaning the training period, while  **OS**  means "Out-of-Sample," the testing period. This helps test how well your Super Alpha performs on new data. Hope this helps!

The  **Component Activation**  setting determines whether each individual Alpha in your Super Alpha combination is active during the  **In-Sample (IS)**  or  **Out-of-Sample (OS)**  phases.

- **IS (In-Sample)** : The training period used to evaluate and optimize your Alpha during its development.
- **OS (Out-of-Sample)** : The validation period used to assess how well your Alpha generalizes to new, unseen market data.

Component Activation lets you choose which base alphas are active during  **In-Sample (IS)**  or  **Out-of-Sample (OS)**  periods. IS evaluates and optimizes your alpha, while OS tests how well it generalizes. Activating only stable components in both periods helps spot overfitting and improve Super Alpha robustness.

Spot on - using Component Activation to isolate stable contributors in both IS and OS has saved me from keeping flashy but overfit components. It’s like running a stress test for each sub-alpha before trusting it in production.

In the Super Alpha setup,  **Component Activation**  refers to how the platform decides which underlying alphas within your Super Alpha are actually active in the final combination. This helps you test whether a subset of your chosen alphas provides a stronger and more stable signal than just blindly averaging them all. Essentially, it’s a way to identify the most impactful contributors while filtering out weaker or redundant ones.

Great question — the Component Activation setting in Super Alpha design is about controlling which base alphas are “active” during different evaluation windows. IS refers to  **In-Sample** , meaning the historical training period where the alpha or pool is first developed and tested. OS refers to  **Out-of-Sample** , which is the forward period reserved to evaluate robustness and guard against overfitting. When you adjust Component Activation, you’re essentially deciding whether each base alpha should contribute only in IS, only in OS, or in both. For example, sometimes an alpha looks strong in IS but weak in OS — if you allow it to stay active in both, it could reduce long-term stability. By carefully toggling activation, you can filter out signals that fail OS validation while keeping stronger contributors. This improves the reliability of your Super Alpha across different market regimes.
