How can we best leverage the newly opened datasets —  *model238* ,  *model32* ,  *model53* ,  *other450* , and  *shortinterest6*  — to develop robust global region alphas given their high coverage across the three underlying geographies?

Great point on coverage consistency. I’d also explore interaction terms between these datasets and region-specific macro variables — sometimes a factor’s true edge only appears when conditioned on local market regimes. Layering in turnover and cost constraints from the start could further ensure OS robustness.

Totally agree with both of you — the high and consistent coverage is a huge plus for global design.
One thing I’ve found useful is to start with simple, independent signals from each of these datasets, then run region-by-region performance checks to see where each one naturally shines. From there, you can either standardize them for a true global alpha or let certain regions carry higher weight if their OS stability is stronger.
Also, don’t forget to watch for hidden correlations — sometimes two factors from different datasets track the same underlying behavior. Pruning those early can keep your portfolio cleaner and help maintain CSAP in the long run

The high and consistent coverage is a major advantage for global design. I’ve found it helpful to begin with simple, independent signals from each dataset, then run region-specific performance checks to identify where each signal naturally excels.

These newly opened datasets are valuable because of their broad coverage across the three underlying geographies, making them well-suited for building diversified global region alphas. A good starting point is to first explore each dataset individually to understand the economic meaning of its fields — for example, whether they represent fundamental, sentiment, or flow-based signals. Then, evaluate each field’s stability and predictive power within each geography using rank ICs or Fama-Macbeth regressions. Once you’ve identified promising fields, consider creating region-specific alphas tuned to local market dynamics, then combining them into a global composite to reduce regional risk concentration. Pay attention to cross-region correlations, as high coverage can sometimes lead to hidden overlap. Using orthogonal transformations and combining these datasets with unrelated factors from other sources can further improve robustness. Keeping a balanced mix of shared and unique signals across regions will help maximize diversification benefits while leveraging the full coverage of these datasets.

Great information, members, so valuable insights to keep me on the move with the competition. I personally appreciate your sharing!

The new datasets you mentioned (model238, model32, model53, other450, and shortinterest6) are especially interesting because of their high coverage across multiple geographies, which can significantly enhance the robustness of global alpha strategies. A practical way to leverage them is to first assess their  *cross-sectional stability*  by checking how distributions behave in GLB, AMR, and ASI individually—sometimes a dataset that looks stable globally can have skewed signals in one region. For example, shortinterest6 could be powerful in U.S. equities where short interest reporting is more consistent, but less so in emerging markets with different disclosure rules. Combining these datasets with operators like  `group_neutralize`  (industry or country-level) can help extract relative information while removing regional biases. Another important point is to measure pairwise correlation between alphas built on these datasets and existing signals—new datasets often add redundant information, so correlation filtering is critical before adding them into a Super Alpha. Finally, layering normalization and outlier clipping will prevent global biases from a single geography dominating the overall signal. In short, these datasets are promising if used with careful distribution checks, group-based adjustments, and correlation control.

Combine the high-coverage datasets ( *model238* ,  *model32* ,  *model53* ,  *other450* ,  *shortinterest6* ) by creating region-specific factor combinations and cross-regional momentum signals, while using the overlapping coverage to build robust neutralization schemes that account for regional market structure differences. Focus on signals that capture regional rotation patterns and relative value opportunities across the three geographies, ensuring your alpha maintains consistency during regime changes by validating performance across different regional correlation environments.

Leverage high-coverage datasets by testing signals across regions, normalizing for comparability, combining core and alternative data, and applying risk controls. Validate with out-of-sample tests to ensure robust, globally consistent alpha performance.
