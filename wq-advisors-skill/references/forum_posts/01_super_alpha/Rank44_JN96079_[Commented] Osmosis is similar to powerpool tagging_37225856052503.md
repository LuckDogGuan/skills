It seems similar but instead of that they want us to have unique and diverse tagging which eventually increases the pnl.

No it is not similar to powerpool tagging.

It is more like the name or description blocks. It is worth notice that the Osmosis block only accept integer greater than 0. If you want to delete the exist osmosis value by API, you should patch None or NULL instead of 0.

Osmosis isn’t comparable to powerpool tagging. Tagging is descriptive, while Osmosis directly influences how capital is allocated and how alphas interact at the portfolio level. Its purpose is diversification and risk control, not classification.

PowerPool tagging classifies eligible alphas so they can contribute to pooled performance and scoring, while Osmosis allocates weights across your tagged alphas and computes a live portfolio PnL based on those weights. In short, tagging determines eligibility, and Osmosis determines how much each alpha contributes and how its performance is aggregated over time.

Osmosis and PowerPool tagging are similar in spirit but quite different in  **mechanism and intent** . PowerPool tagging is essentially a  *classification layer* —it groups alphas based on shared characteristics (datasets, operators, themes, or exposures) so that weighting and risk controls can be applied more systematically. The tagging itself does not change alpha behavior; it helps the platform and researchers understand  **what kind of risk or signal an alpha represents** .

Osmosis, on the other hand, is an  **active allocation and interaction framework** . It dynamically combines multiple alphas, reallocates weights via osmosis points, and reflects live market behavior through metrics like Daily PnL. Correlation, turnover interaction, and regime effects matter much more here. Two alphas with identical PowerPool tags can behave very differently once placed into Osmosis depending on timing, overlap, and market conditions. So while both aim to improve portfolio quality and diversification, PowerPool tagging is descriptive and structural, whereas Osmosis is operational and dynamic.

I think Osmosis is similar to PowerPool tagging, as both categorize and group strategies to improve analysis, selection, and performance tracking.

Not really.  **PowerPool tagging is descriptive**  — it classifies alphas for eligibility and grouping.  **Osmosis is allocative**  — it assigns weights, aggregates PnL, and exposes real interaction effects like correlation, turnover, and costs. Same goal (diversification), very different layers (classification vs capital allocation).

Osmosis is fundamentally different from powerpool tagging. Tagging is mainly descriptive, whereas Osmosis actively affects capital allocation and how alphas combine at the portfolio level. Its role is to manage diversification and risk, not to classify signals.

These function more like name or description fields. It’s important to note that the Osmosis field only accepts integers greater than 0. If you want to remove an existing Osmosis value via the API, you should patch it with  `None`  or  `NULL`  rather than  `0` .

PowerPool tagging identifies which alphas are eligible to contribute, while Osmosis assigns weights and tracks live portfolio PnL. In short, tagging sets eligibility, and Osmosis manages contribution and aggregation.

Osmosis and PowerPool tagging serve related goals, but they operate in fundamentally different ways. PowerPool tagging functions as a descriptive and organizational layer. It classifies alphas by shared traits such as datasets, operators, themes, or risk exposures, allowing both the platform and researchers to better understand and manage diversification. Importantly, tagging itself does not alter how an alpha behaves; it simply provides structure for evaluation and risk awareness. Osmosis, by contrast, is an active allocation framework. It dynamically combines alphas, adjusts weights through osmosis points, and responds to live market conditions, which is reflected in metrics like Daily PnL. Here, interactions between alphas—such as correlation, turnover overlap, and regime sensitivity—play a critical role. As a result, two alphas with identical PowerPool tags can perform very differently once deployed in Osmosis. In short, PowerPool tagging is structural and explanatory, while Osmosis is dynamic, interactive, and execution-driven.
