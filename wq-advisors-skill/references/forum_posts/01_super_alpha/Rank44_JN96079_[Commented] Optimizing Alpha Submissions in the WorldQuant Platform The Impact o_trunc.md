## 帖子正文

In quantitative trading, designing and submitting high-quality alphas is key to earning rewards, especially in platforms like  **WorldQuant** . However, the success of an alpha is not only determined by its raw performance but also by its uniqueness and contribution to a broader portfolio of alphas. Two critical factors in this process are  **correlation with existing alphas**  and  **Sharpe ratio improvements** .

#### **The Role of Correlation in Alpha Selection**

WorldQuant imposes a correlation threshold when evaluating new alphas. Specifically, an alpha can be submitted if its correlation with existing alphas is:

- **Less than 0.7**  (low correlation)
- **Greater than 0.7** , provided its  **Sharpe ratio is at least 10% higher than other alphas**

This rule encourages the submission of alphas that are either:

1. **Diverse in nature**  (low correlation with existing ones), or
2. **Significantly stronger in risk-adjusted performance**  when they exhibit high correlation.

By ensuring low correlation, the platform avoids redundancy and maintains a diversified portfolio of signals, which enhances overall risk-adjusted returns.

However, I tried to submit some high correlation alphas and then now my results are so bad.

#### **Why High Correlation Leads to Lower Payments**

Even though high-correlation alphas are allowed if they have a  **Sharpe ratio at least 10% higher than existing alphas** , submitting too many correlated alphas tends to result in  **lower payments** . The reason behind this lies in the  **diminishing marginal value**  of redundant signals.

Here’s why:

- **Redundant Alphas Add Less Value**
  When an alpha is highly correlated with another already in the system, it does not provide much incremental predictive power. The platform prioritizes unique signals that improve the efficiency of the portfolio rather than redundant ones.
- **Portfolio Diversification is Key**
  A diverse portfolio of low-correlation alphas leads to  **lower risk and more stable returns** . Since highly correlated alphas move together, they do not significantly improve the risk-adjusted performance of the overall strategy.
- **Payment Structure Rewards Unique Contributions**
  The platform rewards alphas that contribute meaningfully to its portfolio. If a new alpha is highly correlated with existing ones, even if it meets the Sharpe ratio criteria, its contribution is  **less valuable** , leading to lower payments.

#### **Best Practices for Maximizing Payments**

To maximize payments when submitting alphas to WorldQuant:

1. **Focus on Unique Alphas**
   - Strive to develop alphas with low correlation (<0.7) to existing ones.
   - Use diverse data sources and methodologies to ensure differentiation.
2. **Improve the Sharpe Ratio Significantly**
   - If your alpha has a correlation above 0.7, ensure its  **Sharpe ratio is significantly better**  (not just 10% but substantially higher) to justify its value.
3. **Monitor Submission Trends**
   - If you notice that multiple high-correlation alphas lead to diminishing payments, shift towards designing more diverse strategies.
4. **Think in Terms of Portfolio Contribution**
   - Instead of maximizing individual alpha performance, consider how your alpha  **fits within a broader set of strategies**  and contributes to overall risk-adjusted returns.

### **Conclusion**

While submitting multiple alphas to WorldQuant can increase earnings, the key is to  **focus on uniqueness and portfolio contribution**  rather than sheer volume. High-correlation alphas may still be accepted if they show superior Sharpe ratios, but their incremental value diminishes, leading to lower payments. To maximize success, traders should aim for  **low-correlation, high-quality alphas**  that enhance overall portfolio diversity and robustness.
