## 帖子正文

Options are an excellent dataset for conducting  *HUMAN based research* . In this article, we will discuss various potential Alphas that can be generated using the ‘Options23’ dataset.

**Dataset Highlights:**

- The ‘Options23’ dataset has 1,936 data fields with both matrix and vector data types.
- The dataset is only available for the USA Region.
- At the time of writing, only 424 Alphas are submitted using this dataset, making it slightly unexplored by the consultant community.

**Introduction:**

Although creating Alphas with a HUMAN approach from a dataset with 2k data fields may seem daunting, it is almost always the case that if you take a closer look at the data, a well-structured approach for generating Alphas with clear hypothesis can be formulated.

As previously discussed, when conducting human-based research, it is crucial to step back and create organized notes on accessing the dataset to formulate logical and non-random hypotheses. This article is one such example of dataset notes for the ‘Options23’ dataset that can help in creating Alphas:

**DATASET NOTES:**

1. The dataset has options data like implied volatility, option greeks, strike prices, etc from  **5 DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES** . Thus one must ensure that while using comparison fields within the dataset, the datasource must ideally remain the same to have a fair comparison.

1. For the aforementioned data sources, the dataset includes both raw values and derived values of various options data. The derived values are primarily weighted averages of Implied Volatility and Option Greeks, using either of the following as weights across multiple data sources:
   1. Volume
   2. Open Interest
2. For the aforementioned data sources and weighted average values, the options data values are calculated at various levels of moneyness. The moneyness levels are highlighted based off a suffix in the datafield from 0 to 9. Below is the list of the options data available in the various order of moneyness levels as highlighted in the datafields:
   1. 0: all
   2. 1: near in and out
   3. 2: near out and in
   4. 3: out
   5. 4: near
   6. 5: in
   7. 6: far out
   8. 7: near out
   9. 8: near in
   10. 9: deep in

Eg: The datafiled ‘opt23_ise_trans_iv_weight_avg_volivput9’ resembles Weighted average Implied volatility for  **deep in-the-money**  put options. Volume is used as weights.

1. Below are the metrics that are available in the dataset from the datasources mentioned in Point 1, across the derived metrics (Point 2) as well as at various moneyness levels (Point 3):
   1. Option Greeks ( [Delta](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/option23?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=USA&search=delta&universe=TOP3000) ,  [Gamma](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/option23?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=USA&search=gamma&universe=TOP3000) ,  [Theta](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/option23?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=USA&search=theta&universe=TOP3000) ,  [Vega](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/option23?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=USA&search=vega&universe=TOP3000) ,  [Rho](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/option23?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=USA&search=rho&universe=TOP3000) )
   2. [Implied Volatility](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/option23?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=USA&search=implied%20volatility&universe=TOP3000)

1. Values that are only available for the various datasources but the fields for which Point 2 and 3 derived values are not relevant are:
   1. [Strike Prices](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/option23?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=USA&search=strike&universe=TOP3000)
   2. [Volume](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/option23?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=USA&search=volume&universe=TOP3000)
   3. [Open Interest](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/option23?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=USA&search=open%20interest&universe=TOP3000)
   4. [Options Close Price (Valid*close)](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/option23?delay=1&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=20&offset=0&region=USA&search=close&universe=TOP3000)

**SAMPLE ALPHA IDEAS:**

**Using the above dataset notes, one can create various Alphas across the 1936 datafields. Some of the ideas are listed below**

1. *Change in Implied Volatility (IV)*
   The changes in IV could hint a change in demand for call and put options, which could hint a change about the sentiment of a stock.
   1. Change in Call IV
   2. Change in Put IV
   3. Change in Call IV – Change in Put IV

1. *Volatility skew*
   The volatility skew resembles the difference in Implied Volatility (IV) between out of the money (OTM), at the money (ATM) and in the money (ITM) options. If investors expect a significant price movement in one direction, these investors would be willing to pay more for options that would profit from this move. Search “Volatility Skew” on your browser and read how can this impact stock prices in various instances.

1. *Ratio of Option Volumes to Stock Volumes. (O/S Volume ratio)*
   High conviction traders are more likely to take a view in the options market, which could tell us how strongly investors feel about a stock. The below may be used as a starting point:
   1. 5 day/22 day average of the O/S Volume ratio
   2. Change of the O/S Volume ratio
   3. 5 day O/S Volume ratio relative to 21 day O/S Volume ratio

**Call for Action:**

*Comment below if you found this post helpful and were able to submit atleast one Alpha using this dataset* . 

Feel free to ask any questions in case of any doubts! We also look forward to hearing if you would like similar notes on other datasets.

The  **Options23 dataset**  offers a rich source of data, including implied volatility, option Greeks, and moneyness-based metrics from five data sources. Key highlights include:

- Derived values such as weighted averages (based on volume or open interest) across moneyness levels (e.g., in-the-money, out-of-the-money).
- Diverse metrics like Delta, Gamma, Vega, Rho, implied volatility, and strike prices.

The dataset is USA-specific and relatively underexplored, making it a promising area for Alpha creation. Example Alpha ideas include:

1. Changes in implied volatility (Call IV, Put IV, or the difference between the two).
2. Volatility skew analysis to understand directional price movement expectations.
3. Option-to-stock volume ratios (O/S Volume ratio) as a proxy for investor conviction.This guide is incredibly well-organized, breaking down a complex dataset into actionable insights and providing a roadmap for hypothesis-driven Alpha development. The detailed explanations of metrics and moneyness levels, combined with clear Alpha examples, make it highly accessible for consultants at all experience levels.

The focus on a structured approach ensures that users can extract meaningful insights without falling into randomness. Additionally, the invitation to share feedback fosters a collaborative and growth-oriented community. Overall, this is an exceptional resource for unlocking the potential of the Options23 dataset!

This is a fantastic guide to navigating the  **Options23 dataset**  and generating meaningful Alphas! The detailed breakdown of data fields, derived metrics, and moneyness levels is particularly helpful for formulating hypotheses.

Some thoughts and questions:

- **Volatility skew** : It’s a powerful signal. Have you tested combining skew data across different moneyness levels (e.g., near vs. far) for cross-sectional Alphas?
- **O/S Volume ratio** : This metric seems promising for identifying high-conviction trades. Have you explored integrating this ratio with sentiment or news datasets for a multifactor approach?
- For  **weighted Greeks** , have you observed better results with volume or open interest as weights, or does it vary by Greek and moneyness level?

I’d also be interested in seeing notes on other datasets, especially those with region-specific nuances or unique derived metrics. Great work!

Hello  [LN78195](/hc/en-us/profiles/4647202315159-LN78195) ,

To mitigate noise in short-term data, especially for event-driven strategies when working with implied volatility and option greeks in the Options23 dataset, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Use Smoothing Techniques** : Apply smoothing techniques such as moving averages or exponential smoothing to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations.
2. **Backfill Data** : Use the  `ts_backfill`  operator to ensure data coverage and reduce gaps that can introduce noise. This is particularly useful for event-driven strategies where data might be sparse or irregular.
3. **Rank and Normalize** : Utilize the  `rank`  or  `zscore`  operators to normalize the data, which can help in reducing the impact of outliers and making the data more robust to noise.
4. **TradeWhen Operator** : Implement the  `trade_when`  operator to conditionally apply your strategy only when certain criteria are met, thereby avoiding trades during periods of high noise or low data quality.
5. **Neutralization** : Apply neutralization techniques to remove market-wide or sector-specific noise, focusing on the relative performance of instruments rather than absolute performance.
6. **Decay Settings** : Adjust the decay settings to smooth out the alpha signals over a longer period, which can help in reducing the impact of short-term noise.
7. **Truncation** : Use truncation settings to limit the weight of individual instruments in your portfolio, thereby reducing the impact of noisy data points.
8. **Simulation Settings**  Experiment with different simulation settings such as delay and decay to find the optimal balance between responsiveness and noise reduction.

Hello  [PM26052](/hc/en-us/profiles/16734176944407-PM26052) ,

The Options23 dataset provides a rich source of data for creating Alpha ideas using option Greeks and implied volatility. While specific recommendations on which moneyness levels work best for different types of strategies are not explicitly provided in the available documents, here are some general guidelines that can help you tailor your strategies:

1. **At-the-Money (ATM) Options** :
   - **Strategies** : ATM options are often used in strategies that rely on high sensitivity to changes in the underlying asset's price, such as straddles and strangles.
   - **Alpha Ideas** : Utilize implied volatility and delta to capture price movements. ATM options typically have the highest gamma, making them responsive to small changes in the underlying asset's price.
2. **In-the-Money (ITM) Options** :
   - **Strategies** : ITM options are suitable for directional strategies where you have a strong conviction about the direction of the underlying asset's price movement.
   - **Alpha Ideas** : Focus on delta and theta. ITM options have higher delta, providing a more direct exposure to the underlying asset's price movements, and lower time decay compared to ATM and OTM options.
3. **Out-of-the-Money (OTM) Options** :
   - **Strategies** : OTM options are often used in speculative strategies or for hedging purposes.
   - **Alpha Ideas** : Leverage implied volatility and vega. OTM options are more sensitive to changes in implied volatility, making them suitable for volatility-based strategies.
4. **Deep In-the-Money (DITM) and Deep Out-of-the-Money (DOTM) Options** :
   - **Strategies** : These options can be used for specific hedging strategies or to take advantage of extreme price movements.
   - **Alpha Ideas** : Consider using gamma and vega. DITM options have very high delta, while DOTM options can provide significant leverage with lower initial cost.

When creating Alpha ideas, it is essential to backtest your strategies using historical data to understand how different moneyness levels perform under various market conditions. Additionally, consider using smoothing techniques, neutralization, and decay settings to mitigate noise and enhance the robustness of your Alpha signals.

Hello  [SS63636](/hc/en-us/profiles/10431327877655-SS63636) ,

Thank you for your detailed feedback! We are glad you found the post insightful and the explanations clear. We will consider elaborating on computational challenges and providing case studies of successfully implemented Alphas in future posts.

### 评论 #33 (作者: JL84897, 时间: 1年前)

Hello  [AM32686](/hc/en-us/profiles/18120082104215-AM32686) ,

Combining skew data across different moneyness levels can indeed be a powerful approach for cross-sectional Alphas. By analyzing the volatility skew at various moneyness levels (e.g., near-the-money vs. far-from-the-money), you can capture different market sentiments and expectations, which can enhance the predictive power of your Alphas.

Integrating the O/S Volume ratio with sentiment or news datasets for a multifactor approach is a promising strategy. The O/S Volume ratio can help identify high-conviction trades by highlighting significant changes in open interest relative to volume. When combined with sentiment or news data, this ratio can provide a more comprehensive view of market dynamics and investor behavior, potentially leading to more robust Alpha signals.

For weighted Greeks, the effectiveness of using volume or open interest as weights can vary depending on the specific Greek and moneyness level. Generally, open interest might be more stable and reflective of longer-term positions, while volume can capture more immediate trading activity. The choice between volume and open interest as weights should be guided by the specific characteristics of the Greek being analyzed and the moneyness level of the options.

This deep dive into the Options23 dataset is truly fantastic. The detailed breakdown of dataset notes, including the diverse data sources, moneyness levels, and the option Greeks, offers a comprehensive foundation for understanding its structure. The emphasis on grasping the dataset's intricacies before diving into Alpha generation is a crucial reminder that preparation is as important as the analysis itself.

The sample Alpha ideas—such as leveraging changes in implied volatility, volatility skew, and the O/S Volume ratio—are excellent starting points for hypothesis generation. I’m particularly drawn to the potential predictive power of volatility skew and changes in call/put implied volatility. These features seem to encapsulate meaningful market sentiment shifts, making them powerful signals for forecasting price movements.

Additionally, exploring the interplay between moneyness levels and time-to-expiration could uncover unique patterns. For example, options with extreme moneyness might behave differently under volatile market conditions compared to those at-the-money.

[AC28031](/hc/en-us/profiles/10267557338007-AC28031)  Thanks for sharing this invaluable resource! I’m excited to explore this dataset further and experiment with these and other Alpha ideas. With its depth and versatility, Options23 seems like a treasure trove for developing innovative trading strategies.

The  **‘Options23’ dataset**  offers a wealth of data, including options-related metrics such as implied volatility, option greeks, and strike prices from five distinct data sources. With 1,936 fields, this dataset is slightly underexplored, presenting an opportunity for generating new Alphas with a well-structured approach.

### Key Highlights:

- **USA Region Only** : The dataset is focused on the U.S. market.
- **Data Types** : Includes both matrix and vector data types.
- **Multiple Data Sources** : Data is derived from five sources, and care must be taken to compare data from the same source.
- **Moneyness Levels** : Data is available at various moneyness levels (from deep in-the-money to out-of-the-money), allowing for granular analysis.

### Example Alpha Ideas:

1. **Change in Implied Volatility (IV)** :
   - Tracking changes in call or put IV may signal shifts in market sentiment.
   - Compare changes in call IV with put IV for insights on market expectations.
2. **Volatility Skew** :
   - Volatility skew shows the difference in IV between options at various moneyness levels and can indicate investor sentiment regarding future stock price movement.
3. **Option Volume vs. Stock Volume** :
   - The ratio of option volume to stock volume (O/S Volume ratio) can reflect investor confidence, with high ratios indicating strong sentiment in the options market.

By utilizing this dataset and focusing on the structured notes provided, you can develop robust Alphas and gain deeper insights into stock movements through options data. If you create any Alphas using this dataset, feel free to share your experience and ask questions!

Thank you for sharing this detailed guide on the ‘Options23’ dataset! The emphasis on organizing notes and formulating structured hypotheses is a valuable approach for tackling such a comprehensive dataset.

One question I have pertains to the volatility skew. When using volatility skews between OTM, ATM, and ITM options, how do you account for market regimes (e.g., periods of high vs. low volatility) to avoid false signals? Additionally, could incorporating weighted averages across multiple moneyness levels provide more nuanced insights into market sentiment?

The idea of the O/S Volume ratio is particularly intriguing. Have you explored whether changes in the ratio, combined with other metrics like implied volatility or delta, could help capture shifts in investor conviction more accurately?

Looking forward to experimenting with these Alpha ideas—thank you again for such an insightful post!

Hey! This is really a detailed and useful post about the 'Options23' dataset. For creating Alphas from it, I think it's smart to focus on those sample alpha ideas. Like the change in implied volatility, it indeed can reflect the market sentiment change. And the volatility skew idea is quite interesting too, as it shows different IVs in different moneyness options. Maybe we can combine some of these factors in a multi-factor model to make the Alpha more robust. Just my two cents. Thanks for sharing!

我是一名定量交易員，最近我也在研究Options23數據集，感覺這個數據集的潛力非常大。透過對這個數據集的分析，我發現了幾個有趣的點，例如，我們可以利用改變的隱含波動性（Implied Volatility）來預測股價的走勢。此外，波動性斜率（Volatility Skew）也可以用來了解投資者的_sentiment_。

我也很感興趣這個數據集的資料來源和weighted averages，尤其是 strike prices、volume 和 open interest 這些變數。這些變數可以幫助我們更好地理解市場的狀況和投資者的行為。

但是，在使用這個數據集時，我也遇到了一些挑戰，例如數據的噪音和不確定性。所以，我在想是否有什麼方法可以用來減少這些噪音和不確定性，例如使用_smoothing techniques_ 或者是_backfill data_。

總的來說，Options23數據集是一個非常有用的資源，可以幫助我們更好地理解市場和投資者的行為。我也期待看到更多的研究和分析結果，來幫助我們更好地利用這個數據集。

我是一名自嘲肥宅的交易員，最近在研究Options23數據集，發現其中的波動性偏斜（Volatility Skew）和選擇權對股票的交易量比（O/S Volume Ratio）這兩個指標頗為有趣。根據數據集的描述，波動性偏斜可以反映投資者對價格運動的預期，而選擇權對股票的交易量比則可以作為投資者信心的指標。

我嘗試使用這兩個指標來建立Alpha策略，結果發現這兩個指標之間存在一定的相關性。當波動性偏斜提高時，選擇權對股票的交易量比也會增加，這可能意味著投資者對價格運動的預期更加強烈。

我想詢問一下大家，在使用Options23數據集建立Alpha策略時， 是否有其他的指標或方法可以用來增強策略的 Robustness 和 Diversity？同時，也希望得到更多的數據集類似的文章介紹，謝謝大家的幫助！
