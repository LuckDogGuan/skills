In alpha research, we often optimize IC and fitness but  **turnover**  quietly determines whether the signal survives real-world deployment.

### Why Low Turnover Matters

**Lower Costs = Higher Real Sharpe** 
High turnover amplifies transaction costs, slippage, and market impact. Many strong backtests collapse after realistic cost modeling. Low turnover preserves edg

**Signal Robustness** 
If performance disappears when moving from daily to weekly rebalancing, the signal may be noise. Durable alphas show graceful decay and don’t depend on precise timing.

**Better Capacity** 
High turnover limits scalability. Low turnover strategies handle more capital and suffer less from liquidity constraints and crowding.

**Reflects Economic Logic** 
Persistent inefficiencies (value, quality, behavioral biases) don’t flip daily. Excessive trading often signals overfitting.

### Practical Tip

Use smoothing (ts_mean, ts_decay), ranking stabilization, or lower rebalance frequency. Small adjustments can reduce turnover dramatically with minimal IC loss and improve net performance.

Great points. I’d add that the optimal turnover sweet spot is essentially a function of the signal’s decay profile. Momentum alphas inherently require higher turnover to capture transient trends before they dissipate. The other way round, fundamental or mean-reversion alphas often have longer half-lives, meaning you can tighten turnover significantly without sacrificing much Gross IC, leading to a much better Net Sharpe. It’s all about matching the trading frequency to the alpha’s natural speed limit.

Strong insight. Costs aren't the only advantage of low turnover it's often a stronger and more sustainable signal. If an alpha survives multiple time iterations of rebalancing less frequently, this is actually a sign of real market inefficiency rather than of short-term noise or overfitting.

Low turnover is one of the clearest signs that an alpha captures a persistent market inefficiency rather than short-term noise. A signal with slightly lower IC but stable turnover often outperforms a high-turnover alpha after transaction costs, slippage, and capacity constraints are considered. In practice, durable alphas tend to survive rebalance frequency changes and maintain performance through smoothing and signal stabilization, making turnover a critical bridge between theoretical edge and deployable strategy.
