## 帖子正文

In the real world, when making super alpha and trying to  **minimize drawdown by using 1/drawdown or -drawdown** , I found that the pnl lines are always downward-sloped. So that means  **higher-drawdown alphas should receive higher weights**  instead of lower-drawdown ones. While this seems counterintuitive, there are some financial theories help explain why this phenomenon occurs.

## **1. The Risk-Return Tradeoff (Modern Portfolio Theory - MPT)**

### **Concept:**

According to  **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** , investors must balance  **risk (volatility, drawdown)**  and  **return**  to construct an  **efficient portfolio** . Higher drawdowns often accompany  **higher returns** , so optimizing purely for  **low drawdown**  might lead to selecting  **low-return alphas** , which weakens the overall performance.

### **Explanation:**

- If you give  **higher weights to low-drawdown alphas** , you may end up with a  **conservative portfolio**  that lacks strong return potential.
- Conversely,  **high-drawdown alphas**  may carry  **stronger return signals** , and weighting them higher  **can improve overall risk-adjusted returns** .
- The optimal weighting  **does not necessarily minimize individual drawdowns**  but rather  **maximizes diversification benefits**  while keeping portfolio drawdown at an acceptable level.

### **Key Takeaway:**

👉  **Minimizing drawdown blindly can result in a portfolio that lacks strong return-generating signals, leading to suboptimal performance.**

## **2. Diversification and Risk Compensation (Risk-Based Portfolio Allocation)**

### **Concept:**

When combining multiple alphas,  **diversification reduces total portfolio risk** . If  **high-drawdown alphas have low correlation with others** , they might contribute  **positively to diversification** ,  **reducing total drawdown at the portfolio level** .

### **Explanation:**

- A high-drawdown alpha could still improve the  **overall SuperAlpha stability**  if it has  **low or negative correlation**  with other alphas.
- The portfolio  **absorbs**  the drawdowns of individual alphas if they  **do not all decline at the same time** .
- This is why  **high-drawdown alphas might receive higher weights** , as they provide  **diversification benefits**  that improve the overall  **risk-adjusted return** .

### **Key Takeaway:**

👉  **High-drawdown alphas may still be valuable if they contribute to diversification and reduce the risk of the overall portfolio.**

## **3. Leverage Effect and Expected Risk Premium (Capital Market Theory)**

### **Concept:**

**Riskier assets (or alphas) must offer a higher expected return**  to compensate for their risk, based on  **Capital Market Theory** .

### **Explanation:**

- Higher-drawdown alphas may signal  **higher expected risk premia** , meaning they might be  **more profitable over the long run** .
- By increasing their weight, you might be capturing  **higher returns per unit of risk**  even if their individual drawdowns are high.
- The goal is not to  **avoid**  risk but to  **allocate risk efficiently**  for higher  **expected Sharpe ratios** .

### **Key Takeaway:**

👉  **If high-drawdown alphas have higher risk-adjusted returns, they deserve higher weights to optimize long-term profitability.**

## **4. Regime Dependency: Drawdown Timing Matters**

### **Concept:**

Some alphas experience  **higher drawdowns only in specific market conditions** , such as  **high volatility**  or  **bear markets** . Weighting these alphas higher might improve performance in  **normal or bullish conditions** , even if they suffer in downturns.

### **Explanation:**

- Some alphas  **recover quickly**  from high drawdowns.
- If a high-drawdown alpha performs exceptionally well in  **most**  market conditions but fails in a few cases, it could still  **add value to the SuperAlpha** .
- **Dynamic weighting strategies**  may be more effective than static ones to adjust for  **market regime changes** .

### **Key Takeaway:**

👉  **High-drawdown alphas might be valuable in certain market regimes, and blindly minimizing drawdown may exclude profitable opportunities.**

## **5. Min-Drawdown Weighting Could Introduce Overfitting**

### **Concept:**

If you  **strictly minimize drawdown**  during optimization, you risk  **overfitting**  to historical data, which may not generalize well to future conditions.

### **Explanation:**

- Market conditions are  **not static** , so weighting schemes based on historical drawdown may fail when market conditions change.
- **High-drawdown alphas might be penalized unfairly**  even if they would perform well in future market conditions.
- A  **more flexible weighting approach**  that balances drawdown, return, and correlation is  **better than pure drawdown minimization** .

### **Key Takeaway:**

👉  **Overfitting to historical drawdown patterns can lead to weak generalization and suboptimal future performance.**

## **Conclusion: A Smarter Approach to Weighting Alphas**

If high-drawdown alphas are getting  **higher weights** , this is  **not necessarily a mistake** —it reflects deeper  **financial principles** :

1️⃣  **Risk-return tradeoff:**  Higher drawdown alphas may offer  **higher expected returns** .
2️⃣  **Diversification effect:**  A high-drawdown alpha can still improve the  **portfolio’s stability**  if it has  **low correlation**  with other alphas.
3️⃣  **Leverage & risk premium:**  More volatile alphas often  **generate higher long-term returns** .
4️⃣  **Market regime dependency:**  Some alphas have  **high drawdowns only in specific conditions**  and remain valuable overall.
5️⃣  **Avoiding overfitting:**  Over-optimizing for  **low drawdown**  can result in  **underperformance in real-world trading** .

💡  **Instead of purely minimizing drawdown, a balanced approach should focus on:** 
✅  **Risk-adjusted return optimization**  (Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio)
✅  **Correlation-based weighting**  (low-correlation alphas get higher weights)
✅  **Adaptive weighting strategies**  that adjust based on market conditions

Thus,  **high-drawdown alphas receiving higher weights is not necessarily wrong—it may be the optimal way to construct a resilient, high-return SuperAlpha.**

[KK82709](/hc/en-us/profiles/13753276889623-KK82709)  In fact, I could see that weighting more for alpha with low drawdown always results bad or negative. Maybe my number of trials is not enough

What a exciting post, but after 1 year without weight, I think this is only work with the high return and high performance with low correlation alphas only. There is a theory that the alpha which has the drawdown higher than the return may have too much risk in the OS. This lead to something bad with both weight factor and merged perforance too, but I'll try this way. Thanks for sharing this!

This is a fantastic breakdown of the reasoning behind weighting high-drawdown alphas higher! I agree with the point about diversification and low-correlation alphas absorbing drawdowns. I’m also curious about the idea of using adaptive weighting methods like dynamic volatility scaling—how do you see this improving risk-adjusted returns in different market regimes? Looking forward to your insights on balancing risk across various conditions!

What an exciting post! However, after a year without weighting, I believe this approach may only be effective for high-return, high-performance alphas with low correlation. There's a theory suggesting that an alpha with a drawdown exceeding its return might carry excessive risk in the out-of-sample (OS) period. This could negatively impact both the weighting factor and the merged performance. That said, I find this approach intriguing and will give it a try. Thanks for sharing!

Do you consider skewness and tail risk metrics when adjusting weights to avoid extreme downside events?

---

### 评论 #11 (作者: LM22798, 时间: 1年前)

High-drawdown alphas may receive higher weights in portfolio construction due to their potential for strong expected returns, especially if they exhibit low correlation with other assets, enhancing diversification. While they introduce volatility, strategies like  **mean-reversion, Kelly Criterion optimization, and convex payoff structures**  can justify overweighting them if they contribute to superior risk-adjusted returns. Additionally, some high-drawdown alphas tend to rebound in specific market regimes, making them valuable in a dynamic portfolio

That is interest view of how can we using high drawdown alpha, but if high drawdown focus on single point, it can lead to drawdown in whole super alpha, we should control that situation.

### 评论 #13 (作者: TP85668, 时间: 1年前)

Thank you for sharing such insightful perspectives on weighting high-drawdown alphas! Your analysis of the risk-return tradeoff, diversification effects, and market regime dependence is truly valuable. How do you incorporate real-time market signals to dynamically adjust alpha weights while preventing excessive risk in extreme market conditions?

This is an excellent deep dive into the  **role of drawdown in alpha weighting** ! Your breakdown of  **MPT, diversification, leverage effects, regime dependency, and overfitting risks**  aligns well with practical quantitative portfolio management.

The observation that  **minimizing drawdown blindly can reduce return potential**  is critical. Many traders fall into the trap of over-penalizing volatile signals, leading to  **weak return generation** .

### 评论 #15 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 1年前)

This is a great discussion on balancing risk and return, particularly when considering high-drawdown alphas. I agree that diversification and low-correlation alphas can play a crucial role in absorbing drawdowns, which is essential in managing risk over the long term. Adaptive weighting methods, such as dynamic volatility scaling, can be especially useful in improving risk-adjusted returns across different market regimes. By adjusting the weight of alphas based on their volatility or risk in real time, this method ensures that the strategy can stay resilient during periods of high market stress, potentially enhancing overall performance.

However, as you pointed out, if an alpha has a drawdown that exceeds its return, it may carry excessive risk, especially in the out-of-sample period. This could impact both the weighting factor and the merged performance. How do you approach evaluating the trade-off between risk and return when adjusting for market volatility or regime changes?

This is an  **excellent exploration**  of why  **high-drawdown alphas might receive higher weights**  within a  **SuperAlpha framework** ! A potential refinement to this strategy is  **dynamic drawdown-adjusted weighting** , where alpha weights shift based on market regimes—allocating more to high-drawdown alphas  **only when their risk-adjusted returns are improving** . Additionally,  **risk parity principles**  could be incorporated by scaling exposure  **not just by return potential, but also by the alpha's conditional drawdown behavior in different volatility environments** . Have you experimented with  **cluster analysis on alpha correlations**  to ensure that high-drawdown alphas remain  **truly diversifying rather than compounding downside risk** ?

### 评论 #17 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 1年前)

Weighting high-drawdown Alphas effectively is a compelling approach to portfolio construction, especially when considering diversification and low-correlation Alphas to absorb risk. The balance between drawdowns and potential returns highlights the importance of strategic risk management.

An interesting consideration is the use of adaptive weighting techniques, such as dynamic volatility scaling, to enhance risk-adjusted returns across different market conditions. Adjusting Alpha weights based on changing volatility could improve stability and resilience, particularly in turbulent markets.

It would be valuable to explore real-world scenarios where this strategy has delivered strong results. Understanding how these adjustments perform in various market regimes could offer deeper insights for investors seeking to refine their approaches and optimize long-term portfolio performance.

### 评论 #22 (作者: SK90981, 时间: 1年前)

Excellent information about risk-return trade-offs!  It makes sense to balance adaptive weighting, diversification, and high-drawdown alphas.  Have you examined the resilience of dynamic regime-based adjustments?

### 评论 #23 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 1年前)

Balancing risk and return is crucial, especially when dealing with  **high-drawdown Alphas** . Diversification and low-correlation signals help absorb losses and stabilize overall performance. One powerful technique is  **adaptive weighting** , such as  **dynamic volatility scaling** , which adjusts Alpha weights based on real-time volatility or risk levels. This approach enhances risk-adjusted returns and keeps the strategy resilient across market regimes, particularly during stress periods.

However, if an Alpha’s drawdown consistently exceeds its return, it may carry excessive risk, threatening long-term robustness—especially out-of-sample. Carefully evaluating this trade-off is vital when adjusting weights for changing volatility or market regimes.

Real-world testing of these adjustments can offer valuable insights into their impact. How do you incorporate dynamic weighting or regime detection in your process? Sharing strategies could help refine risk management and maximize long-term Alpha performance while minimizing adverse impacts.
