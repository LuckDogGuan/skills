What is Fast D1?

Fast D1 is a framework for developing Alphas that use data available between day 0 (D0) and day 1 (D1). By leveraging the most current overnight information - such as news, earnings announcements, analyst updates, and pre-market activity - Fast D1 Alphas can capture predictive signals that deliver superior performance compared to regular D1 models.

**Key Advantage:**  Access to real-time overnight catalysts that traditional D1 Alphas miss.

How to Simulate Fast D1 Alphas

**Simple 2-Step Process:**

1. **Select Delay-1**  in simulation settings
2. **Use fields with _fast_d1 suffix**

**Important Notes**

✅  **Every Fast D1 field has a regular D1 equivalent**  (just without the  **_fast_d1**  suffix)
✅  **No separate delay dropdown**  for Fast D1-it's the same Delay-1 setting
✅  **Currently available only in the USA region** 
✅  **Same submission criteria**  as regular D1 alphas

**Key Takeaways**

✨  **Fast D1 captures the overnight edge**  that traditional D1 misses
✨  **Focus on news, options, social media, and earnings**  datasets
✨  **Use delta approaches**  (fast_d1 - regular) for unique signals
✨  **Submit only superior performers**  compared to D1 equivalents
✨  **Target high-quality signals**  with margin > 4 bps

Thanks for this information.

I think this is all what we should know in the fast D1 theme alphas

Is the fast_d1 performance better than regular d1 performance mandatory for the submission?

JUST A CONCERN;

Should all fast D1 alphas outperform their counterpart normal D1 alphas and what is the effect of submitting one with slightly inferior perfomance?

Fast D1 is a specialized framework designed for building alphas that rely on information available between day 0 and day 1, giving you access to fresh overnight catalysts that standard D1 models simply cannot capture. By selecting Delay-1 in simulation settings and using fields with the _fast_d1 suffix, you can simulate these signals easily. Every Fast D1 field has a regular D1 counterpart, and the submission rules remain identical. Currently supported only in the USA region, Fast D1 is particularly effective when combined with news, earnings updates, social metrics, and options data. Using delta-based approaches—comparing fast_d1 to regular fields—helps uncover stronger predictive edges. Always aim to submit only the versions that outperform traditional D1, ideally with margins above 4 bps.

Fast D1 is a framework for alphas that leverage data available between D0→D1, capturing overnight catalysts like news, earnings, and analyst updates that standard D1 models miss. In simulation, you simply use Delay-1 with *_fast_d1 fields; they mirror regular D1 fields but with stronger overnight sensitivity and are currently USA-only. Fast D1 works best when using fast_d1 – regular deltas to extract unique signals, and should only be submitted if the model clearly outperforms its D1 counterpart.

Fast D1 provides an overnight informational edge by using D0–D1 updates. Leveraging fast_d1 fields with Delay-1 enables stronger, timely alphas, especially when combining news, earnings, and delta-based signals.
In my experience in these days, it is pretty easy to generate summitable regular alpha and I've summit over 10 alpha with fast D1data.

Fast D1 is a framework that uses data released between D0 and D1—like news, earnings, and analyst changes—to capture overnight signals missed by standard D1 models. You simulate it with Delay-1 and *_fast_d1 fields, which mirror regular ones but reflect fresher activity and are U.S.-only. The best signals compare fast_d1 vs. regular data, and only clearly superior alphas should be submitted.

Great insights from everyone. Fast D1 clearly adds value by capturing overnight catalysts that regular D1 misses, and the simple Delay-1 + *_fast_d1 setup makes it easy to adopt. The delta approach (fast_d1 vs regular) seems especially powerful for finding stronger signals. Focusing on only submitting versions that genuinely outperform their D1 counterparts is a solid takeaway.

Fast D1 is a specialized framework for building alphas using information available between day 0 and day 1, enabling you to capture overnight catalysts that standard D1 models miss; by selecting Delay-1 in simulation and using fields with the _fast_d1 suffix—each paired with a regular D1 counterpart—you can simulate these signals under the same submission rules. Currently available only in the USA region, Fast D1 works especially well when paired with news, earnings, social, or options data, and delta-style comparisons between fast_d1 and standard fields often strengthen predictive power. Ultimately, you should submit only Fast D1 versions that clearly outperform traditional D1, ideally by more than 4 bps.

### 评论 #10 (作者: AG14039, 时间: 6个月前)

Great points all around—Fast D1 adds meaningful value by capturing overnight catalysts that standard D1 overlooks, and its straightforward Delay-1 plus *_fast_d1 setup makes adoption simple. The delta method comparing fast_d1 to regular fields is particularly effective for uncovering stronger signals, and the key takeaway is to submit only those Fast D1 variants that truly outperform their standard D1 counterparts.

This explanation of the Fast D1 theme is very clear and helpful. It shows how much value there can be in using information that arrives overnight, especially around news, earnings, and analyst updates. These events often have an immediate effect on price the next day, so capturing that window can make the signal more responsive than regular D1 models. I also like that the process to simulate these alphas is straightforward, since using the fast D1 fields and setting the correct delay makes it easy to experiment. It would be interesting to see examples of which data fields tend to work best in this framework. Thank you for sharing this useful overview.

In essence, Fast D1 fills in the information gap that occurs between the market closing and the next-day open, which is when most significant price discovery takes place. When used carefully, Fast D1 can provide a real time advantage in situations where information speed is crucial.

Great overview of Fast D1. The ability to capture overnight catalysts like earnings and news really explains why some signals outperform standard D1. The delta approach (fast − regular) is especially interesting.

### 评论 #14 (作者: HT71201, 时间: 5个月前)

Fast D1 enables alphas on day 0–1 data, capturing overnight catalysts missed by standard D1. Using  `_fast_d1`  fields with Delay-1 allows easy simulation. Most effective in the USA with news, earnings, social, and options data. Delta comparisons to regular D1 highlight stronger edges; submissions should beat D1 by 4+ bps.
