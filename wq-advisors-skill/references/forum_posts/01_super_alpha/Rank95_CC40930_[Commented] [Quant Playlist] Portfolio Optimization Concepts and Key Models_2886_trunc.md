## **Portfolio Optimization: Concepts and Key Models**

Hello, today's topic is portfolio optimization. Below is the prepared agenda:

### **Agenda**

- What is Portfolio Optimization?
  - Definition of Portfolio Optimization
  - Objectives of Portfolio Optimization

- Key Theories and Models
  - Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization
  - Black-Litterman Model
  - Risk Parity

## **1. What is Portfolio Optimization?**

#### **Definition of Portfolio Optimization**

Portfolio optimization is a methodology used to allocate assets in a way that maximizes an investor's expected returns or minimizes risks. It considers asset returns, volatility, and correlations to effectively achieve investment objectives.

#### **Objectives of Portfolio Optimization**

- **Balance Between Risk and Return**
  - Maximize returns for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a target return.
- **Maximize Diversification Effects**
  - Utilize correlations among assets to enhance the benefits of diversification and reduce portfolio risk.
- **Tailored Asset Allocation for Investment Goals**
  - Design customized portfolios based on the investor's risk tolerance, investment horizon, and expected returns.

## **2.  Key Theories and Models**

#### **(1) Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization**

Developed by Harry Markowitz in 1952, this foundational model of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) optimizes the balance between returns and risks across assets to construct an efficient portfolio.

**Key Concepts** :

- **Expected Portfolio Return** :
  Weighted average of individual asset returns.

> Lp
> Uilli
> i1
> Hp: Expected return of the portfolio
> Ui: Weight of asseti
> Li: Expected return of asset


- **Portfolio Risk (Variance)** :
  Weighted combination of asset variances and covariances.

> D =
> UiWjOij
> 1
> jL
> 43: Portfolio variance (risk)
> Oij: Covariance between asset iand asset j


**Efficient Frontier:**

- Represents the portfolios offering maximum returns for a given risk level or minimum risk for a given return level.

**Constraints** :

- Total asset weights sum to 100%.


> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> Ui


- Individual asset weights must be non-negative.

> Ui
> 二0
> Vi


#### **(2) Black-Litterman Model**

Developed by Fischer Black and Robert Litterman in the 1990s, this model combines market equilibrium and investor beliefs to provide more stable and realistic portfolio allocations.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Market Equilibrium** :
  Asset weights in the market portfolio are proportional to their market capitalization.
- **Investor Beliefs** :
  Incorporates subjective views on expected returns and risks for specific assets or sectors.

**Model Structure:**

- Combines market equilibrium returns (π) with investor beliefs to calculate adjusted expected returns.:


> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> E[#
> T 十T . PI . (Q-1 . (Q -卫.T))
> 卫[#: New expected returns
> Market equilibrium expected returns
> 卫: View matrix (reflects investor opinions on specific assets)
> 0
> Investor views (expected returns for assets based on Views)
> Q: Uncertainty in views (confidence in investor opinions)
> T: Market
> uncertainty adjustment factor


**Advantages:**

- Integrates market data with subjective views for realistic portfolios.
- Prevents extreme portfolio weights, ensuring stability.

#### **(3) Risk Parity**

Risk Parity is an asset allocation strategy designed to equalize the contribution of each asset to the overall portfolio risk. This approach lowers the weight of volatile assets while increasing the weight of less volatile assets to enhance stability.

**Key Concepts** :

- **Risk Contribution** :
  Measures each asset's contribution to the total portfolio risk.


> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> RCi
> Ui
> Owi
> RCi: Risk contribution Of asset i
> Ui: Weight of asset i
> Op: Portfolio standard deviation
> Q0e


- **Objective** :
  Equalize risk contributions across all assets.


> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> RCI
> RC2
> RCn


**Advantages** :

- Reduces the impact of highly volatile assets.
- Delivers stable performance even in volatile markets.

**Optimization Problem** :

- **Objective Function** : Adjust weights to ensure equal risk contributions.

### 

Portfolio optimization is a critical tool for achieving an investor’s risk tolerance and return objectives.

1. **Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization**  optimizes the trade-off between risk and return and provides optimal asset allocation through the efficient frontier.
2. **Black-Litterman Model**  integrates market equilibrium and investor beliefs for realistic portfolio construction.
3. **Risk Parity**  balances risk contributions to enhance portfolio stability.

By selecting the appropriate model and applying it effectively, you can design sophisticated and reliable asset allocation strategies. Explore various strategies and apply them in practice to achieve your investment goals!

Portfolio optimization is a methodology that allocates assets in a way that maximizes returns or minimizes risk, depending on an investor's preferences. It helps investors strike a balance between risk and return while maximizing diversification and aligning asset allocation with specific goals. Key theories and models like Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization, Black-Litterman Model, and Risk Parity offer different approaches to achieve optimal portfolio performance. Markowitz focuses on balancing returns and risks, Black-Litterman combines market equilibrium with subjective views for stability, and Risk Parity ensures equal risk contribution across assets for stable performance, even in volatile markets.

Daniel Bloch’s framework merges multifractal theory and machine learning (ML) to tackle challenges in dynamic financial markets. It addresses  **non-Gaussian distributions** ,  **long-term dependence** , and  **dynamic instability**  by combining robust mathematical models with ML’s adaptability. Key innovations include:

- **Calibrated ML Models** : Trained to replicate statistical properties like volatility shifts.
- **Dynamic Meta-Models** : Ensemble models dynamically adjust weights based on market conditions.
- **Hybrid Methods** : Combines Neural Networks (ANN) with Genetic Algorithms (GA) for feature selection and optimization.

Despite challenges like high computational costs and noise, this approach enhances robustness and adaptability, paving the way for resilient trading strategies. 🚀

Thank you for sharing! Portfolio optimization models often assume efficient markets, but in reality, factors such as market anomalies, transaction costs, and liquidity can reduce portfolio effectiveness. To address this, it is necessary to integrate these factors into the models, such as adding cost constraints or using robust optimization methods to ensure the optimization results are more aligned with real market conditions.

Portfolio optimization is a systematic approach used to determine the optimal allocation of assets in a portfolio. The goal is to either  **maximize expected returns**  for a given level of risk or  **minimize risk**  for a target return. It takes into account several factors such as the  **returns**  of individual assets, their  **volatility** , and the  **correlations**  between them. By effectively balancing these factors, portfolio optimization helps in achieving the investment objectives while managing risk

Portfolio optimization is a structured method for determining the best allocation of assets within a portfolio. The aim is to either maximize returns for a set level of risk or minimize risk for a desired return. It considers various factors such as individual asset returns, volatility, and correlations between assets. By balancing these elements effectively, portfolio optimization helps meet investment goals while controlling risk.

Portfolio optimization is a strategy used to find the ideal distribution of assets within a portfolio. Its primary goal is to maximize returns for a given risk level or minimize risk for a specific return target. This process evaluates factors like the returns of individual assets, their volatility, and how they correlate with one another. By strategically managing these factors, portfolio optimization aims to achieve investment goals while keeping risk in check.
