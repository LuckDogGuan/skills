## 帖子正文

A  **drawdown**  is the percentage loss of an  **alpha**  from its highest point. For example, if an alpha has gained  **20% returns**  but then drops to  **18%** , the drawdown is  **2%** . Since alphas have both ups and downs, drawdowns are a normal occurrence.

### Key Aspects of Drawdowns:

1. **Largest drawdown**  in an alpha’s history (and in each year).
2. **Duration**  of the largest drawdown.

When performing a  **backtest** , it’s essential to measure drawdowns alongside  **annualized return**  and  **investment ratio** . Sometimes, alphas recover quickly after a drawdown, while others may take a long time to perform well again. In real deployment, it’s difficult to tell whether an alpha has permanently failed or if it will recover.

### Importance of Historical Drawdowns

By measuring  **past drawdowns**  in an  **in-sample period** , we create a benchmark to assess current performance. This helps in decision-making and understanding potential risks.

### Minimizing Drawdowns and Risk

Reducing drawdowns is key to managing risk. Some effective techniques include:

- **Limit exposure**  to a single security.
- **Reduce exposure**  to similar securities.
- **Avoid over-reliance**  on common alpha factors.
- **Minimize market exposure**  (regional or global indexes).

### Balancing Returns and Risk

It’s tempting to focus on  **high returns**  while designing an alpha but ignoring drawdowns can be risky. Using risk-reducing techniques can help avoid large drawdowns. However, reducing risk  **may also lower performance** , since some past returns were driven by those risks.

By maintaining a  **balanced approach** , alphas can achieve stable and sustainable performance.

Not all drawdowns should be treated equally some occur due to temporary noise, while others stem from a changing market regime. Regime-based adjustments, such as scaling exposure based on volatility or macroeconomic conditions, can help mitigate unnecessary drawdowns. Techniques like dynamic position sizing and risk-parity weighting allow an alpha to adapt to shifting market environments.

我是一名量化交易員，對於alpha策略的風險管理很感興趣。根據我的理解，關鍵在於在回報和風險之間取得平衡。通过限制單一證券的敞口、減少相似證券的敞口、避免對共同alpha因子過度依賴等技巧，可以有效地降低跌幅風險。但是，降低風險也可能會導致回報下降。因此，需要細心評估和管理這兩個因素，以實現穩定和可持續的表現。同時，我也認為使用 seperti Calmar比率等指標來評估alpha策略的風險和回報是非常重要的。

The OS Sharpe ratio is based on the active set of alphas and their performance, so once an alpha is decommissioned, it would not contribute to the calculation. However, this can depend on how the system is set up and if there's any lag or caching mechanism, so it’s worth checking the specific rules of your setup or documentation

Use  **logical operators**  (like  `Trade_when`  or  `if_else` ) to apply conditions where certain alphas are activated only when specific market conditions occur. This can help reduce overlap in market conditions where certain alphas tend to perform similarly, thus diversifying the set of conditions under which each alpha is used.

The smaller the drawdown is, the better the alpha. As I know, drawdown ratio affects directly to the Sharpe of alphas because it reflects the return efficiency. Furthermore, hedge funds must keep a low drawdown ratio. If the drawdown ratio is too high, investors may become increasingly concerned and withdraw their capital from the fund.
