 I am facing this problem when I try to build  **SuperAlpha** . Is there anyone else experiencing this problem?

How can this problem be resolved?

Some dataset in ASI are decomissioned but it still can select alpha with those decomissioned dataset. Try to use other dataset ot avoid that errors.

What is the region? I think the IT group is working on that.

Yes, others have experienced similar SuperAlpha submission issues. Common causes include incompatible child alphas (different region/delay/universe), disabled or expired alphas, or child alphas not fully passing OS requirements. Make sure all components share the same scope and are valid. If the issue persists, try refreshing the session or contact support with a screenshot so they can investigate system-side problems.

You can ask mail this issue to support.May be they can help better.

Hi, did your Super Alphas get hit because they selected decommissioned alphas? This update decommissioned ~70 of mine (all oth455). Or are you running alphas outside your tier, e.g., GLB alphas? (jzc

Hey!!,

I also faced the same issue.

I just re-simulated it and it worked fine

the same was happening to me maybe its due to browser cache, it is retaining the selected alphas in selection expression which is eventually failing, i noticed this and tried using firefox instead of chrome and it worked (seems like clearing browser cache also works).

SuperAlpha submission issues are unfortunately not uncommon, and in many cases they are  **structural rather than user-error driven** . From experience, problems usually fall into a few categories. First,  **eligibility constraints** : even if individual component alphas pass metrics on their own, they may violate SuperAlpha requirements when combined—such as overlapping datasets, excessive correlation, incompatible regions/universes, or hidden turnover amplification. Second, there can be  **system-side delays or sync issues** , where recently submitted or updated alphas are not yet fully indexed for SuperAlpha construction, leading to temporary failures.

Another point to check is  **weight stability and contribution logic** . SuperAlpha is more sensitive to marginal contribution than standalone alphas, so signals that look fine individually may be rejected due to redundancy or insufficient incremental value. When this happens, reviewing correlation matrices and removing structurally similar components often resolves the issue. If all structural checks look clean, it’s also worth waiting and retrying, as platform-side issues do occur. Treating SuperAlpha construction as a portfolio engineering task rather than a mechanical step usually leads to better outcomes.

Thank you for raising this issue—many consultants encounter similar problems but assume it’s something they’re doing wrong and don’t ask publicly. Bringing it up helps clarify that SuperAlpha construction has additional layers of complexity compared to single-alpha submission.

I appreciate that you asked both  *whether others are experiencing it*  and  *how it can be resolved* . That framing encourages practical, experience-based responses rather than guesswork. Discussions like this are valuable because they help demystify SuperAlpha and set more realistic expectations about the process. Hopefully others will share their experiences as well, and thanks for contributing to a more transparent and supportive community.

SuperAlpha submission problems are fairly common and are often caused by structural factors rather than simple user mistakes. In many cases, individual alphas may pass all required metrics on their own but fail once combined, due to issues such as dataset overlap, high internal correlation, incompatible regions or universes, or unintended turnover amplification at the portfolio level. System-side factors can also play a role, including indexing delays after recent submissions or updates, which may temporarily prevent alphas from being recognized as eligible components. Another frequent challenge relates to marginal contribution: SuperAlphas are evaluated on incremental value, so signals that appear strong in isolation can be rejected if they add little diversification or duplicate existing behavior. Reviewing correlation structures, simplifying components, or removing redundant signals often helps. When everything looks structurally sound, retrying after some time can also resolve platform-related issues.

This isn’t an isolated problem—many users have run into the same roadblocks when submitting a SuperAlpha. Most of the time, the issue comes down to one or more underlying components not lining up properly. That could mean child alphas built with different regions, delays, or universes, signals that have been disabled or have expired, or alphas that exist but haven’t fully cleared their out-of-sample requirements. It’s worth carefully confirming that every component is active, valid, and defined under an identical scope. If everything checks out and the submission still fails, a simple session refresh can sometimes resolve it. Otherwise, reaching out to support with a screenshot is the best way to determine whether there’s a system-side issue at play.
