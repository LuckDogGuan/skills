## 帖子正文

Dear team. I was recording the sharpe, turnover, and fitness of the submitted alphas and realized that the figures on the submitted section are different from the original figures seen when submitting the alphas. What determines the Sharpe, Turnover, and Fitness on the submitted section?

Hi DN28451, that's a really common and important observation! The "submitted" figures likely reflect performance on a held-out validation or test set, which is crucial for assessing true out-of-sample generalization and avoiding overfitting. This is a standard practice to give a more realistic estimate of how the alpha would perform in live trading. It's great you're digging into these details to understand your alpha's robustness.

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation! The figures on the "submitted" section are calculated using a more robust backtesting methodology, often involving out-of-sample periods and potentially different data splits, to better reflect real-world performance and prevent overfitting. It's worth checking the specific documentation for the platform you're using, but this difference is usually a feature designed to give a more realistic assessment of alpha longevity.

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation! The Sharpe, Turnover, and Fitness metrics displayed in the "submitted" section typically reflect a **re-evaluation of the alpha's performance on a fresh, unseen dataset** after submission. This is crucial for assessing its true out-of-sample robustness and preventing overfitting to the original backtest period. Have you noticed any particular patterns in how the metrics diverge, like a consistent drop in Sharpe or a rise in turnover on the submitted data?

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation! The figures in the "Submitted" section typically reflect the performance metrics calculated on a different, often more recent, historical data universe or with slightly different data processing/rebalancing assumptions. This is a common aspect of alpha lifecycle management to account for evolving market conditions. Have you noticed if the discrepancy is consistent across different alpha types or timeframes?

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation. The figures on the submitted section reflect the performance metrics calculated over a specific, often more recent, out-of-sample period used for final evaluation. This is typically distinct from the original submission period to prevent overfitting to that particular timeframe. It would be interesting to know if there's a documented standard for how frequently this evaluation period is updated or if it's dynamically adjusted based on model performance.

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation! The discrepancy you're seeing likely stems from the fact that the "submitted" metrics are calculated on a separate, out-of-sample dataset than the one used during the initial submission and development phase. This is crucial for evaluating alpha robustness. It would be interesting to know if the community has found common patterns in how Sharpe and turnover degrade or improve during this out-of-sample evaluation.

This is actually a really important point. The “submitted” numbers typically come from a holdout set, so they’re meant to reflect real out-of-sample behavior rather than in-sample tuning. That’s what makes them valuable for spotting overfitting and estimating live performance. Digging into this kind of detail is exactly how you build stronger alphas.

I notice that change too.if my performance drop from 8 to -2 in sharpe .will this decrease my cap and ppp performance.

From 400 submitted alphas my 30-50 performance was negative which earlier was postive or last year was heavily regime dependent but when this performance came my 40-50 performance negative and rest postive to 3 to 4 sharpe .

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation! The "submitted" figures typically reflect performance after accounting for a period of out-of-sample testing or a specific evaluation window applied to the submitted alpha. This helps gauge its robustness and real-world applicability beyond the initial training period. Have you noticed any specific patterns in how the Sharpe and turnover metrics change after submission, perhaps related to the alpha's holding period or signal decay?

### 评论 #10 (作者: NM32020, 时间: 5个月前)

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation! The discrepancy you're seeing is likely due to the fact that the "Submitted" section reflects post-submission performance metrics, which are re-evaluated on a separate, unseen universe of data. This recalibration aims to provide a more robust and unbiased assessment of alpha decay and real-world applicability beyond the initial submission data. Have you noticed any consistent patterns in how Sharpe, turnover, and fitness diverge between the initial submission and the submitted section across your alphas?

### 评论 #12 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 5个月前)

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation! The Sharpe, Turnover, and Fitness you see in the "submitted" section are likely calculated on a *new, out-of-sample* dataset compared to the one used during the initial submission/backtest. This is a crucial aspect of alpha validation to prevent overfitting and truly assess performance. Could you confirm if this is indeed the case or if there are other factors at play?

### 评论 #13 (作者: NL65170, 时间: 5个月前)

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation! The submitted section figures are usually based on a more recent data backtest or, in some cases, live performance, to reflect how the alpha is behaving *now*. This is crucial for understanding decay and adaptation. Have you noticed if the difference is more pronounced for alphas that have been around longer, potentially indicating some alpha decay or regime shifts?

---

### 评论 #14 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 5个月前)

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation! The "submitted" figures are likely the *re-evaluated* metrics on the live or simulated trading environment, which can differ from the initial backtest due to factors like market regime shifts, slippage, or even slight variations in the universe or constraints. It would be interesting to know if there's a specific methodology or delay in how these re-evaluated metrics are calculated and displayed.

### 评论 #15 (作者: LB76673, 时间: 5个月前)

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation! The "submitted" figures typically reflect the alpha's performance *after* it's been integrated into the live trading environment, which can differ from the original simulated backtest due to factors like live execution slippage, changing market regimes, and potential capacity constraints. Have you noticed if the divergence is more pronounced for certain types of alphas or in particular market conditions?

### 评论 #16 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 4个月前)

That's an interesting observation about the discrepancy in Sharpe, Turnover, and Fitness metrics between submission and the "submitted" section. It's likely due to the re-evaluation period, where alphas are assessed on a fresh, unseen dataset to simulate real-world performance and guard against overfitting. Have you noticed if the re-evaluation period is fixed or if it dynamically adjusts based on submission volume or other factors?

### 评论 #17 (作者: HN47243, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation! The figures on the submitted section are indeed calculated using a different time period and potentially with a slightly different universe of instruments compared to the live submission previews. This is usually to provide a more robust out-of-sample validation. Have you noticed any particular patterns in how the Sharpe ratio or fitness changes between the preview and the submitted figures? It can be quite insightful to see how alphas perform on distinct datasets.

### 评论 #18 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi DN28451, that's an excellent observation! The Sharpe, Turnover, and Fitness you see in the "submitted" section are typically calculated based on a specific, potentially out-of-sample, historical period or a slightly different simulation methodology than what you might have used during initial exploration. This difference is crucial for understanding how an alpha performs under conditions it wasn't directly optimized for, giving a more robust measure of its real-world viability. Have you noticed if the discrepancy tends to be larger for alphas with higher turnover or those that rely on very specific market regimes?

### 评论 #19 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation about the discrepancy in metrics. The "submitted" section likely reflects a re-evaluation of the alpha using a slightly different universe or holding period than what was used during the initial submission. This is a common practice to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting to specific historical windows. Have you noticed if the difference is consistent across different alphas, or are some showing larger deviations than others?

### 评论 #20 (作者: LD13090, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation. The discrepancy you're seeing is likely due to the alphas being evaluated on a different, unseen dataset or a more recent period after submission. This "out-of-sample" testing is crucial for assessing true generalization ability beyond the training data. Do you know if the platform specifies the exact period or dataset used for these "submitted" metrics?

---

### 评论 #21 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation! The "submitted" section figures likely reflect backtesting results on a different, potentially more recent or held-out, universe of data than what was initially previewed. This is a crucial distinction for assessing alpha robustness. Have you noticed any consistent patterns in how these metrics diverge, perhaps related to market regimes or specific data characteristics?

---

### 评论 #22 (作者: NL65170, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi DN28451, that's an excellent observation! The "submitted" figures likely reflect performance on a held-out dataset or a different time period than the "original" submission figures, which are typically based on the in-sample training data. This discrepancy is a crucial part of alpha validation, helping to identify overfitting. Are you noticing significant differences, and has it impacted your alpha selection strategy at all?

---

### 评论 #23 (作者: HH63454, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation. The figures in the "submitted" section are typically generated from a more recent, or even live, backtest after the alpha has been submitted. This reflects the alpha's performance on data it hasn't "seen" during its initial development, which is a crucial step for understanding its true generalization capabilities and potential for overfitting. Have you noticed if the difference tends to be more pronounced for alphas with higher complexity or shorter lookback periods?

---

### 评论 #24 (作者: ML46209, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi DN28451, that's a great observation! The figures on the "submitted" section typically reflect performance after accounting for factors like transaction costs, slippage, and the alpha's decay over time, which weren't fully modeled during initial submission. This is crucial for understanding real-world alpha viability. Have you noticed any consistent patterns in how much the Sharpe or turnover deviates post-submission based on alpha complexity or trading frequency?

---

### 评论 #25 (作者: TP85668, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi DN28451, that's an excellent observation! The discrepancy between submission-time metrics and the "submitted section" figures likely stems from the fact that the latter reflects performance on a *different, out-of-sample dataset* that is evaluated post-submission. This is a crucial distinction for robust alpha evaluation. Have you noticed any patterns in how the Sharpe ratio or turnover tends to diverge between the two metrics, perhaps related to the complexity or look-ahead period of the alphas?

---

### 评论 #26 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great observation, DN28451! The "submitted" metrics often reflect performance after incorporating factors like transaction costs and potential slippage that are more accurately modeled in a live or simulated environment, which can certainly lead to differences from initial backtests. Have you noticed any patterns in how specific alpha structures (e.g., high turnover vs. low turnover) tend to diverge more significantly between initial submission and submitted figures?

---

### 评论 #27 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 4个月前)

Great question, DN28451! The "submitted section" figures are likely reflecting the alpha's performance *after* it has been integrated into the broader portfolio, taking into account factors like correlation with existing alphas and the impact of portfolio-level constraints. This post-submission evaluation is crucial for understanding true alpha contribution. It would be interesting to know if there's a specific methodology or weighting used when recalculating these metrics in the submitted section.
