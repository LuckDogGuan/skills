Hi everyone,

How can we improve our combined alpha performance, combined selected alpha performance and combined power pool alpha performance?

Please suggest some beneficial tips.

I am also curious about how to improve like you, does anyone know if anyone can help to improve the ability to generate better combined alpha performance

Great question! I’ve seen the biggest improvement by combining diverse alphas that come from different logic families — momentum, mean reversion, volatility, etc. Diversity in signal behavior really enhances the PowerPool’s long-term consistency.

To improve combined alpha performance, check if your alphas are too similar mix different types to get better balance. Keep reviewing and adjusting their weights based on recent results and risk. Watch for hidden issues like too much exposure to volatility or liquidity. You can also use methods that combine alphas fairly so each one adds value. Finally, track which alphas stop working over time and replace them with new, stronger ideas.

- **Focus on high information ratio (IR):**  Aim for IR > 2.0 in simulations before submission.
- **Ensure robustness:**  Test across universes, time zones, and parameter variations.
- **Avoid redundancy with Power Pool:**  Use the “similarity” tools in Brain to avoid submitting alphas that already exist in the pool.
- **Innovate in idea generation:**  Use unique signals such as:
  - Cross-sectional residuals (e.g., regression residuals against market factors)
  - Nonlinear transformations (e.g., rank(abs(delta(X, n))) * sign(X))
  - Combination of fundamentals with price-based features.

**Focus on diversification, reducing correlation, refining feature selection, optimizing weighting schemes, and continuous validation to enhance combined alpha performance.**

Asking the same question.More insights from the community and official ones will be highly appreciated.

Thanks for asking such a question.

You can boost combined alpha performance by focusing on  **diversification**  (low correlation between alphas),  **stability**  (consistent performance across time and regions), and  **risk control**  (neutralizing major factors). Regularly pruning weak alphas and reweighting strong, uncorrelated ones also helps improve the overall power pool.

Improving combined alpha performance starts with making sure your signals truly complement each other rather than repeating the same behavior. Instead of submitting many similar alphas, it is usually more effective to mix different idea types so the portfolio stays balanced across regimes. Regularly review performance and adjust weights based on recent stability, risk contribution, and information ratio, not just raw returns. It is also important to watch for hidden exposures, such as excessive sensitivity to volatility, liquidity, or market direction, which can quietly dominate results. Fair combination methods help ensure that each alpha contributes proportionally, while similarity checks reduce redundancy with existing Power Pool signals. Finally, tracking decay over time and retiring alphas that lose effectiveness makes room for new, more resilient ideas grounded in fresh intuition. Which techniques have helped you most in identifying when an alpha has truly stopped adding value?

Enhancing the performance of a combined alpha portfolio begins with ensuring that individual signals genuinely diversify one another rather than expressing the same underlying behavior. Submitting fewer but more distinct ideas is often more effective than deploying many highly correlated alphas, as diversification helps maintain robustness across different market regimes. Ongoing performance evaluation is essential, with weights adjusted based on recent consistency, risk contribution, and information ratio instead of headline returns alone. It is equally important to monitor unintended exposures, such as strong links to volatility, liquidity, or overall market movements, which can silently drive results. Using fair combination frameworks allows each alpha to contribute appropriately, while similarity analysis helps avoid redundancy with existing signals in the pool. Lastly, observing signal decay over time and systematically retiring weakened alphas creates space for new, more durable ideas built on fresh insights.
