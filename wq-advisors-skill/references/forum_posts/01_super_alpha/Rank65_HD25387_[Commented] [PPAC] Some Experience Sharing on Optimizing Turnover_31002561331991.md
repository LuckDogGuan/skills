## 帖子正文

Hello everyone👋 I've been a consultant for some time now, and I've always been copying the work of experts on the forum. Recently, I happened to catch the PPAC competition and picked up USA again.
Today, I found an alpha factor. At the beginning, the Turnover reached 62%. I took a look at the Performance Comparison and although it could add over 2000 points, the impact on the Turnover indicator was too significant. So, I decided to optimize it.

> ***This article is not so much a valuable experience as some thoughts I'd like to share with you all.***

With the guidance and assistance of my groupmates and teachers, I attempted to use the three ops: ts_target_tvr_. Eventually, after using  **ts_target_tvr_decay** , I achieved better results. The Turnover dropped to 27%, the Margin rose to 10%, and both Fitness and Drawdown improved slightly. The Return decreased by 3%, but let's consider it an exchange. Overall, I still made a profit. In the end, the score I could add in the Performance Comparison dropped to 1800, which is within an acceptable range. After all, I'm not some kind of expert.

During the optimization process, I also learned a lot and felt that my understanding of Operators has deepened. At the beginning of the optimization, I always wanted to apply an op to every parameter, thinking that "everyone would be happy", but the result was exactly the opposite. The performance of IS was extremely poor. Later, I tried to reduce the number of ops and only used one ts_target_tvr_ op to optimize the original signal, but it still didn't meet expectations. Due to the late hour, it was already past two o'clock in the morning when I was writing this post, and my thinking was a bit muddled. Just when I was at a loss, I remembered the previous maxTrade, which the teacher introduced as taking into account various miscellaneous fees in the actual market (not very accurate). At that moment, I thought: Since this signal is not very stable, I'll start maxTrade to take advantage of some of the market chaos to offset it. So I think everyone can  **try to turn on this maxTrade**  more often.😄

It's not that this alpha is particularly good or that my optimization is particularly impressive. It's just that during this learning process, I experienced a sense of achievement and also realized the importance of inspiration. The reason I didn't submit it is that I believe I will find a better alpha. Staying up until the early hours of the morning to optimize was purely out of interest, which also shows that curiosity is indispensable when exploring factors. I hope everyone, whether in PPAC or in the future, can find more and better alphas and become a GM or achieve the VF1.0 accomplishment as soon as possible.

Your optimization journey is impressive! Given your experience with ts_target_tvr_decay and maxTrade, how do you balance trade-offs between turnover reduction and return loss? Do you have a framework for deciding when a return drop is an acceptable "exchange" for stability?

The backtest results are promising, demonstrating strong performance in both train and test periods. The model’s ability to adapt to different volatility regimes makes it well-suited for various market conditions. However, exploring additional macro indicators or sentiment analysis could refine the regime-switching mechanism, potentially enhancing predictive power.

It sounds like you had a rewarding experience optimizing your alpha factor! The process of adjusting parameters, experimenting with operations, and finding the right balance between Turnover and Margin clearly deepened your understanding of the strategy. Your use of maxTrade to offset market chaos shows practical thinking and adaptability.

It's great that you're focused on continuous improvement rather than settling for the current results. Your curiosity and willingness to experiment will definitely lead to even better solutions in the future. Keep up the great work! 😊

At present, there is no clear framework for making trade-offs and judgments. It mainly depends on the differences between them. For instance, if the Turnover has decreased significantly while the Return has only slightly declined, I would still choose to submit this Alpha even if the final PPAC score is not that high. Additionally, I also use Pnl to assess the quality of the Alpha. For example, yesterday, after I submitted an Alpha that met the PPAC conditions, I found that all the other alternative Alphas would be penalized, with some even deducting 3000 points. Therefore, I believe these conditions cannot be judged separately. However, I'm not sure how to allocate the weights of each indicator if such a judgment framework is to be developed. Moreover, even if this framework is developed, it seems that the cost-effectiveness is not very high. I hope the experts can offer some guidance!

It is great how the operator ts_target_tvr_decay worked greatly for you. I've tried implementing it in my alphas but I realize that it is reducing my sharpe by a very significant amount. Is there something I'm not doing right? Otherwise, kudos on sharing with us such an eye-opener.

Even though this alpha may not be perfect, the process of optimization was incredibly rewarding. The learning experience itself was valuable. I didn’t submit it because I believe I can find a better alpha, but the curiosity and drive to improve were key to this process.

Optimizing turnover isn’t just about minimizing the number of trades—it’s about making smarter, more strategic decisions to enhance your portfolio’s efficiency while keeping transaction costs and tax implications in check. By adopting a systematic approach, you can achieve long-term success without overtrading.

### 评论 #12 (作者: AK40989, 时间: 1年前)

As you continue to refine your strategies, consider documenting the specific thresholds at which you find the trade-off between turnover reduction and return acceptable, as this could serve as a valuable framework for future optimizations.

This post provides valuable insights into the process of optimizing turnover while maintaining profitability, and it highlights the importance of practical adjustments in quantitative strategies. The use of the  `ts_target_tvr_decay`  operator to optimize turnover and reduce its impact on performance is a great example of balancing different metrics to improve overall strategy robustness. The realization that not every parameter requires an operator, and that reducing complexity can lead to better results, is an essential lesson in model optimization. Furthermore, the suggestion of using the  `maxTrade`  operator to account for market chaos and its associated fees is an interesting strategy. It seems that by embracing this adjustment, you're leveraging real-world market frictions to reduce volatility in the signal. To enhance this optimization further, you could consider exploring more sophisticated risk-adjusted performance metrics, such as the Sharpe ratio or Sortino ratio, to ensure that the improvements in turnover and margin are not achieved at the expense of risk. It would also be interesting to see how other market factors, like liquidity or sector-based volatility, influence the outcome when integrated into the model. Overall, your approach to learning and refining signals exemplifies the iterative process of improving alpha models.

Really appreciate you sharing this journey — it’s not just about the alpha or the optimization, but the thought process behind it that makes this post resonate. Dropping turnover from 62% to 27% while preserving most of the signal’s strength is no small feat, and using  `ts_target_tvr_decay`  to find that balance shows a solid grasp of both the art and science behind alpha construction.

Thanks for sharing your journey! 🎯 Your post is a great reminder that alpha optimization is a process of learning, trial, and intuition. Reducing turnover from 62% to 27% while improving margin and drawdown shows solid progress. The insights about operator usage and the role of  `maxTrade`  are especially practical. Keep experimenting and sharing—these reflections help the whole community grow!

Through this optimization journey, I gained valuable insights and deepened my understanding of Operators. Initially, I overloaded my strategy with multiple ops, hoping to boost performance, but it led to poor IS results. Simplifying by using just one  `ts_target_tvr_`  op still didn’t meet expectations. Exhausted and uncertain, I recalled the  `maxTrade`  setting, which, though not perfectly precise, accounts for real market frictions. I enabled it to leverage market chaos and surprisingly saw improvements. This experience taught me that sometimes less is more, and tools like  `maxTrade`  can be surprisingly effective—definitely worth experimenting with more often.

### 评论 #18 (作者: DD24306, 时间: 1年前)

This was a truly inspiring read. The way you walked through the optimization process—from initial high turnover to strategic use of  `ts_target_tvr_decay` —really highlights the importance of experimentation and insight in alpha refinement. Loved the honest reflection on mistakes too, especially the part about trying to “make everyone happy” with too many ops. The late-night grind, the “aha” moment with  `maxTrade` , and the emphasis on curiosity over perfection—resonates deeply. Keep pushing, and that VF1.0 won't be far off.

### 评论 #19 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 1年前)

Thanks for sharing such a relatable and well-documented journey into optimizing turnover. Your experimentation with  `ts_target_tvr_decay`  particularly stood out—it's an operator I’ve found to be underrated for balancing trade frequency with signal integrity. The trade-off between Return and Turnover that you described is one we all face, and your willingness to accept a small drop in Return for a cleaner, more stable signal is a great example of real-world alpha thinking. I’m also glad you mentioned the impact of overusing ops early in the process—operator bloat can easily lead to overfitting. Curious if you experimented with operator placement (e.g., pre/post-processing) or layering it with other constraints like  `ts_zscore_limit` ?

### 评论 #20 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 1年前)

I really appreciate you sharing your experience here, particularly the insights on using  `ts_target_tvr_decay`  to manage turnover effectively. It's always a balancing act between optimizing for returns and controlling turnover, and your approach is a great example of thoughtful experimentation. I’d be curious to hear more about how you handled the interaction between turnover and margin—it's interesting how a small decrease in return can lead to such significant improvements in other metrics. Also, have you tried integrating regime switching logic into this? It might help in adjusting the turnover dynamically based on market volatility, which could complement your optimization. Would love to explore that further with you!

### 评论 #21 (作者: KK82483, 时间: 1年前)

To everyone working with ts_target_tvr_decay, it’s worth pointing out that the operator behaves quite differently depending on the structure of the underlying signal. If your alpha is already low-frequency or regime-sensitive, decay might dull its edge.

---

### 评论 #22 (作者: YB19132, 时间: 1年前)

Operator placement and sequencing matter just as much. Using ts_target_tvr_decay earlier in the stack (i.e., before signal amplification or scaling ops) can reduce its effectiveness, especially if followed by aggressive transforms.
