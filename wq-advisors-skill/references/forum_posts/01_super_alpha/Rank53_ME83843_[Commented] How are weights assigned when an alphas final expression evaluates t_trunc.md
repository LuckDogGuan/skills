## 帖子正文

The platform says weights are distributed based on the calculated value of the alpha to determine how much to buy or sell. But what happens if the last expression of the alpha is just a boolean?

For example, if I want to allocate equal weight to every stock that meets a condition, can I simply return that condition as the final expression? Or does the platform handle it differently?

If your final alpha outputs a Boolean, Brain converts it into 1/0 values, then normalizes those 1’s across the buy side and the 0’s get no weight. So yes, returning a condition works for equal-weight selection, but remember all selected stocks still get normalized weights, not truly identical raw weights.

If your alpha’s final expression evaluates to a  **boolean**  (TRUE/FALSE), the platform internally  **converts it to numeric values** —typically  **1 for TRUE and 0 for FALSE** . Then the system  **normalizes these values**  to generate portfolio weights. This means only the stocks with value 1 get weight, and they will receive  **equal weights**  if all of them have identical values. So yes, you  *can*  output a condition directly, and the platform will treat it as a filter and assign equal weights to all qualifying stocks.

Usually True/False is converted to numeric 1/0 values by language I think, if you want 1/-1 then may do some extra work.

If your alpha ends with a TRUE/FALSE output, the system turns that result into numbers—usually 1 for TRUE and 0 for FALSE—and then normalizes them. Only the TRUE names get included, and because they all share the same value, they receive equal position sizes. So yes, you can return the condition directly; the platform interprets it as a pass/fail screen and spreads the weight evenly across the stocks that pass.

When an alpha ends in a boolean, it’s treated like a signal mask. True gets mapped to a positive weight and False to zero (or sometimes the opposite if you invert it). The actual weight scaling happens afterward during standardization/normalization, so the boolean just defines  *which*  instruments get exposure — not the final magnitude.

If your alpha outputs TRUE/FALSE, the platform simply converts that to 1s and 0s and normalizes the result, giving equal weights to all TRUE names while excluding the FALSE ones, so you can return the condition directly and it will function as a pass-fail screen with evenly distributed positions among the passing stocks.

When an alpha outputs a boolean, it essentially acts as a mask: TRUE becomes a positive weight, FALSE becomes zero (or the reverse if inverted), and the subsequent standardization or normalization determines the actual weight scaling, meaning the boolean only decides which instruments receive exposure—not how large that exposure ultimately is.

When an alpha’s final output is a boolean, the platform will convert it into numeric values before assigning weights. True becomes 1 and false becomes 0. After that, the system will normalize the non-zero values so the total weight adds up correctly. In simple terms, every stock that meets the condition will receive equal weight, and everything else receives zero. So yes, you  *can*  return a boolean expression as your final output if your goal is equal allocation across a selected group. Just remember that this removes all relative ranking information, so the alpha becomes a pure filter instead of a scored signal.

If your alpha outputs a Boolean, Brain converts it to 1/0, normalizes the 1’s on the buy side, and gives 0’s no weight. So conditions work for equal-weight selection, but weights are normalized, not truly identical.

While you can just write  `close > open` , it is often safer and clearer to use the  `if_else`  function (or the ternary operator) to explicitly define your weights.

When an alpha’s final expression evaluates to a boolean, the platform effectively treats it as a  *selection mask*  rather than a continuous scoring signal. Internally, TRUE/FALSE values are converted into numeric form (typically 1 for TRUE and 0 for FALSE). Once converted, the standard portfolio construction pipeline takes over: normalization, scaling, and any risk or region constraints are applied on top of those numeric values. As a result, only the instruments with a value of 1 participate in the portfolio, and because they all share the same raw value, they end up receiving equal weights after normalization. This makes boolean outputs useful for constructing equal-weight baskets conditional on a rule (e.g., liquidity filters, regime flags, eligibility screens). However, it’s important to note that such an alpha carries no cross-sectional ranking information, so it cannot express relative conviction among selected names. In practice, many researchers prefer to use boolean logic as a gating mechanism combined with a continuous signal (via  `if_else` ) to preserve both selection and ranking power.

When an alpha’s final expression evaluates to a boolean value (TRUE/FALSE), the platform automatically converts that output into numeric form—typically assigning 1 to TRUE and 0 to FALSE. After this conversion, the standard normalization process is applied to construct portfolio weights. As a result, only the instruments that satisfy the condition (TRUE) receive exposure, while the rest receive zero weight. Because all qualifying stocks share the same raw value, the allocation is distributed evenly among them unless additional scaling or transformations are applied earlier in the expression. In effect, a boolean alpha behaves like a screening or filtering mechanism: it determines  *which*  instruments are included, not  *how strongly*  they are weighted. The final position sizing is handled entirely by the platform’s normalization logic rather than by the boolean itself. Have you found boolean-style alphas to be more effective as standalone signals or as filters combined with continuous factors?

When an alpha resolves to a boolean outcome, it functions as a selection rule rather than a graded signal. The system first converts TRUE and FALSE values into numerical form, typically mapping them to 1 and 0. From that point onward, the usual portfolio construction steps—such as normalization, scaling, and constraint handling—are applied. Only instruments flagged with a value of 1 are included, and since they all begin with the same score, they receive equal weights after normalization. This makes boolean expressions well suited for building rule-based, equal-weight portfolios tied to conditions like eligibility screens or regime filters. However, because no ranking information is present, these signals cannot convey relative confidence. For this reason, boolean logic is often more effective when used to gate a continuous factor, preserving both selection and differentiation.

When an alpha produces a boolean output, it functions as a mask: TRUE assigns a positive weight, FALSE assigns zero (or the opposite if inverted). The final weight magnitude is set by subsequent standardization or normalization, so the boolean mainly determines which instruments get exposure, not the size of that exposure.

A boolean alpha acts as a mask—TRUE gives exposure, FALSE does not—while weight scaling is set by normalization or standardization.
