how to improve JPN robustness sharpe in ASIA, i've previously noticed that changing and lowering decay improves the sharpe but for much lower values?

In my experience, the initial data selection largely determines the Sharpe in the Japan sub-region, mainly due to differences in dataset coverage across Japan. One practical trick is to prioritize datasets that explicitly include “Japan” in their names (you can find some in "other"), as they are more likely to provide better coverage and more reliable signals for that region.

For JPN within ASIA, Robust Sharpe is often very  **decay-sensitive**  due to Japan’s high liquidity and fast-reacting microstructure. Lowering decay can indeed boost Sharpe, but pushing it too low usually makes the signal overly reactive and less OS-stable. In practice, a  **moderate decay range (around 5–10)**  tends to be safer, especially when combined with  **signed_power (p < 1)**  or  **rank**  to compress outliers. JPN alphas in ASIA also benefit strongly from  **sector/industry neutralization** , longer lookbacks in the  *raw signal*  (not just decay), and robustness checks across universes (e.g., TOP500 vs TOP1000). The key is not peak Sharpe at one decay, but  **stability when decay is slightly perturbed** .

Thanks for sharing and yes, I've also noticed that - but mostly "other" datafields perform much well in ASI region.

JPN v.s. IND, which one is more challenging? Does the experience in IDN robustness handling work as well for the JPN robustness?

JPN Sharpe in ASIA is indeed very decay-sensitive. I’ve seen better robustness by pairing moderate decays with longer raw lookbacks and stronger neutralization, rather than pushing decay too low. Testing stability across nearby decays and universes seems more informative than optimizing for a single peak.
