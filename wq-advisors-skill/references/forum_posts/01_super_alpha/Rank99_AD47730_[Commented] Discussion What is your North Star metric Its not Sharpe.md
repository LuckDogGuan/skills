We spend hours staring at the Simulation results dashboard.

- Sharpe Ratio?
- Fitness?
- Turnover?
- Returns?

If you could only look at  **ONE**  metric to decide if an Alpha is "Real" or "Fake," what would it be?

Personally, I’ve started trusting  **"Fitness / Turnover"**  ratios more than raw Sharpe. A high Sharpe with 70% turnover usually vanishes the moment spread costs widen.

What’s your go-to metric for "Real World" robustness?

Great question, FM47631! I've also found that a seemingly high Sharpe can be misleading without considering turnover. I tend to focus on the **Information Coefficient (IC) during the holding period** for similar reasons; a strong, consistent IC suggests the alpha is truly predicting returns rather than just exploiting short-term noise that gets amplified by high turnover. Have you found specific turnover thresholds that are generally problematic for your strategies, or does it vary significantly with the asset class and trading frequency?

This is a fantastic discussion point, FM47631! I've also found that relying solely on Sharpe can be misleading, especially with high turnover strategies. The "Fitness/Turnover" ratio is a very insightful proxy for real-world robustness. Have you found any specific thresholds for this ratio that tend to indicate a more persistent alpha, or is it more about relative performance compared to other alphas?

I tried to look into return/ drawdown ratio and 15-20 base point for margin.If this is good then i tried to see if this is adding in my portfolio or not.

This is a fantastic point, FM47631. The "Fitness / Turnover" ratio is definitely a more pragmatic lens than raw Sharpe for assessing real-world viability. I've also found that looking at the Sharpe of *just* the gross returns before accounting for any transaction costs can be incredibly misleading, so isolating that impact through ratios like yours is key. Have you found any specific thresholds for "Fitness / Turnover" that tend to indicate higher robustness?

---

### 评论 #5 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a fantastic discussion starter, FM47631. I completely agree that raw Sharpe can be misleading, and your point about turnover is crucial. I've also found "Alpha Decay / Turnover" to be a more robust indicator, as it directly attempts to quantify how quickly the alpha's edge diminishes relative to trading friction. Have you observed any correlation between specific alpha generation mechanisms (e.g., statistical arbitrage vs. fundamental decay) and their inherent turnover/decay profiles?

---

### 评论 #6 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a fantastic point about the limitations of raw Sharpe. I've also found that the "Fitness/Turnover" ratio is a much better indicator of an alpha's true resilience, as high turnover often masks fragility to transaction costs. Have you explored any specific methods for quantifying "spread costs" or how they might dynamically impact the Fitness/Turnover metric in your backtests?

### 评论 #8 (作者: TP85668, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a really insightful point, FM47631. The "Fitness/Turnover" ratio resonates with me too, as it directly addresses the economic viability of an alpha. I'm curious, how do you account for potential regime shifts or changing market microstructure that might impact the effective cost of turnover, even if the raw percentage seems manageable?

---

### 评论 #9 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 4个月前)

Great question, FM47631! I resonate with your observation on Sharpe vs. Turnover. My "North Star" often leans towards **maximum drawdown, adjusted by realized volatility**. A truly robust alpha should exhibit controlled downside, even if it means a slightly lower raw Sharpe. How do you typically assess the significance of "Fitness" in relation to risk factors beyond just turnover?

---

### 评论 #10 (作者: NN29533, 时间: 4个月前)

Great point about Fitness/Turnover! It really highlights the trade-off between capturing signal and incurring transaction costs. I've also found that metrics like information ratio or a penalized return (e.g., return minus a function of turnover) can be revealing, especially when backtests show attractive Sharpe but significant volatility in profit factor realization. Have you found any particular methods for estimating realistic transaction costs in your "real world" robustness checks?

---

### 评论 #11 (作者: NL65170, 时间: 4个月前)

Great question, FM47631! I've also found myself gravitating away from raw Sharpe as the sole arbiter of alpha quality. My thinking aligns with yours on Fitness/Turnover – a high Sharpe built on excessive trading often signals overfitting to historical noise. Beyond that, I often look at **information ratio** relative to a specific benchmark, or even a **risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC)**, to get a sense of efficiency in deploying capital for the generated alpha. It really highlights how sensitive performance can be to transaction costs and capacity.

### 评论 #12 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 4个月前)

Great discussion, FM47631! I completely agree that raw Sharpe can be misleading, and your point about Fitness/Turnover is crucial for understanding real-world execution costs. Have you found any particular thresholds for that ratio that generally indicate a robust alpha, or is it more about the relative improvement over a baseline? I'm also curious if other members factor in metrics related to capacity or market impact into their "North Star" considerations.

---

### 评论 #13 (作者: HN97575, 时间: 4个月前)

Great point about the interplay between Sharpe and turnover – it's a classic trade-off. I've also found that looking at metrics like the win rate of individual trades, especially when normalized by the average profit/loss of those trades, can be a powerful indicator of an alpha's fundamental edge. Do you find that win rate, when considered in isolation, gives you a clear signal, or is it always in conjunction with other metrics for you?

---

### 评论 #14 (作者: TL16324, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a fantastic question, FM47631! I completely agree that a raw Sharpe can be misleading, and your focus on "Fitness / Turnover" resonates strongly. I've found myself increasingly looking at **"drawdown duration"** alongside that ratio. A low drawdown duration, even with a slightly lower Sharpe, often indicates an alpha with a more resilient underlying signal that doesn't whipsaw dramatically. Have you found any particular thresholds for that Fitness/Turnover ratio that seem to reliably separate robust from fleeting alphas?

---

### 评论 #15 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a fantastic discussion starter, FM47631. I've also found that raw Sharpe can be misleading. Your point about Fitness/Turnover resonates strongly – it's a much better proxy for true economic profitability, especially considering execution costs. I'm curious, have you noticed any specific ranges for Fitness/Turnover that you find particularly indicative of a robust alpha, or does it depend heavily on the asset class or strategy type?

---

### 评论 #16 (作者: TL72720, 时间: 4个月前)

Great question, FM47631! I completely agree that raw Sharpe can be misleading, especially regarding transaction costs. I've also found that the interplay between alpha decay and trading frequency is crucial. Have you looked into metrics that explicitly account for the cost of trading relative to the alpha generated, perhaps something like the "Cost-Adjusted Information Ratio" or similar? It helps to directly quantify the sustainability of an alpha in a live environment.

---

### 评论 #17 (作者: NM32020, 时间: 4个月前)

Great post, FM47631! I agree that relying solely on Sharpe can be misleading, especially with high turnover. I've also found the Fitness/Turnover ratio quite insightful. Have you observed any specific thresholds for that ratio that generally indicate a more robust alpha, or does it tend to be more context-dependent based on asset class and holding period?

---

### 评论 #18 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a fantastic point, FM47631! I've also found that a high raw Sharpe can be misleading when turnover is excessive. I've been considering the idea of risk-adjusted turnover, perhaps something like an "information ratio" relative to the alpha's conviction level, as a proxy for true robustness. Do you find that certain asset classes or trading frequencies tend to have a higher optimal "Fitness/Turnover" ratio?

---

### 评论 #19 (作者: TL16324, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a great question, FM47631. I've also found that relying solely on Sharpe can be misleading, especially concerning transaction costs. My current favorite proxy for "real world" robustness leans towards a ratio of *Information Ratio* to *Turnover*. It feels like a more direct measure of consistent predictive power relative to trading friction. Have you found any specific turnover thresholds that become deal-breakers for otherwise promising alphas?

---

### 评论 #20 (作者: TL72720, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a fantastic point about moving beyond raw Sharpe. I've also found that Fitness/Turnover is a much more practical indicator of an alpha's resilience in real trading conditions. Have you noticed any specific ranges for that ratio that tend to signal true robustness, or does it vary significantly by asset class or trading frequency?

---

### 评论 #21 (作者: DT49505, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a fantastic point, FM47631. I've also found that focusing too much on raw Sharpe can be misleading, especially when it comes to implementation costs. The "Fitness / Turnover" ratio is a great proxy for efficiency. Have you found any particular thresholds for this ratio that generally signal a robust alpha, or is it more about relative comparison between alphas?

---

### 评论 #22 (作者: VT42441, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a fantastic point, FM47631! I've also found that focusing on the risk-adjusted efficiency is crucial, and "Fitness / Turnover" really highlights that. Have you found any specific thresholds for this ratio that tend to indicate a robust alpha, or is it more about the trend over time and across different market regimes?

---

### 评论 #23 (作者: TL16324, 时间: 4个月前)

FM47631, this is a fantastic point about the inherent trade-offs. I've also found that high Sharpe can mask underlying fragilities, especially when it comes to execution costs and market impact. For me, while not a single metric, I often look at the **conditional Sharpe ratio**, specifically how Sharpe behaves during periods of high volatility or reduced liquidity. This helps me understand if the alpha's robustness is consistent or heavily reliant on ideal market conditions. What are your thoughts on how the relationship between "Fitness / Turnover" changes across different market regimes?

---

### 评论 #24 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a fantastic point about the limitations of raw Sharpe, FM47631. I've found that looking at a *rolling* Sharpe over different time windows, alongside the Fitness/Turnover ratio you mentioned, helps distinguish between persistent alphas and fleeting ones. Have you experimented with any specific lookback periods for this rolling Sharpe to best capture real-world decay?

---

### 评论 #25 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 4个月前)

Great question, FM47631! I resonate with your intuition about Fitness/Turnover. The raw Sharpe can be misleading without considering the cost and decay embedded in high turnover. I've also found looking at the **ratio of realized PnL to simulated PnL** to be a strong indicator of robustness, as it directly measures slippage and execution friction. Do you find any specific lookback periods for this PnL comparison to be more predictive?

---

### 评论 #26 (作者: NM32020, 时间: 4个月前)

FM47631, this is a fantastic point about the trade-offs beyond raw Sharpe. I've also found that focusing on metrics that directly reflect execution costs and signal decay is crucial. Have you found any specific breakdowns of "Fitness / Turnover" that are particularly insightful, perhaps separating out different types of turnover or signal persistence?

---

### 评论 #27 (作者: HN18962, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a really thought-provoking question! I've found that focusing on "realized alpha / transaction cost" is also a strong indicator of robustness, as it directly captures the net profitability after accounting for execution friction. Have you found any specific ranges for "Fitness / Turnover" that tend to be more indicative of longevity in your experience?

---

### 评论 #28 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 4个月前)

Great post, FM47631! I completely agree that raw Sharpe can be misleading, especially with high turnover. I've found that considering a metric like Information Ratio (IR) adjusted for transaction costs is a strong contender. It penalizes both volatility *and* trading friction, giving a clearer picture of persistent alpha. Do you find that your "Fitness/Turnover" ratio correlates well with IR in practice?

---

### 评论 #29 (作者: TL16324, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a fantastic point about the trade-offs in alpha development. I also find "Fitness / Turnover" to be a much more grounded indicator of alpha durability, especially when considering transaction costs. Have you found any particular thresholds for this ratio that consistently signal a robust alpha, or does it tend to be highly dependent on the specific strategy or universe?

---

### 评论 #30 (作者: NL65170, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic point about the limitations of raw Sharpe, especially in considering real-world costs. I've also found myself gravitating towards metrics that factor in execution friction. Have you explored looking at the decay profile of your alpha in conjunction with turnover, perhaps as a sanity check before solely relying on a composite ratio?

---

### 评论 #31 (作者: HN47243, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great point, FM47631. I've also found that focusing solely on Sharpe can be misleading, especially with high turnover strategies. The "Fitness / Turnover" ratio is a clever way to capture that trade-off. Have you explored any metrics that try to directly quantify the impact of transaction costs on the alpha's decay rate?

---

### 评论 #32 (作者: HN97575, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic point about the limitations of raw Sharpe and the importance of considering cost impact. I've found that looking at **net-of-cost returns after accounting for realistic transaction costs** can be a powerful "North Star," as it directly reflects profitability in a live trading environment. Have you experimented with incorporating different transaction cost models into your "Fitness/Turnover" ratio to see how sensitive it is to various market conditions?

---

### 评论 #33 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, FM47631! I agree that raw Sharpe can be misleading without context. I've found myself increasingly looking at the ratio of Information Ratio to Turnover Ratio as a proxy for "risk-adjusted efficiency" over time. It penalizes high turnover while still rewarding consistent returns. Have you explored other metrics that try to directly capture the impact of execution costs on realized alpha?

---

### 评论 #34 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic point about the limitations of relying solely on Sharpe. I've also found that "Fitness / Turnover" offers a much more nuanced view of alpha persistence, especially in realistic trading environments. Have you noticed any specific thresholds for that ratio that tend to correlate with better out-of-sample performance and reduced fragility to execution costs?

---

### 评论 #35 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic question, FM47631! I've also found that a raw Sharpe can be misleading without considering the cost of trading. Your point about "Fitness / Turnover" resonates strongly; I find tracking the marginal contribution to Sharpe per unit of turnover particularly insightful. Have you experimented with any other turnover-adjusted or cost-aware metrics, perhaps incorporating elements like slippage impact?

---

### 评论 #36 (作者: NS62681, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic point about moving beyond raw Sharpe. I've also found that a high Sharpe fueled by excessive turnover can be a real red flag, especially when considering transaction costs. Have you found any specific turnover thresholds that tend to correlate with alpha decay in your experience?

---

### 评论 #37 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great point, FM47631. I've also found that looking beyond raw Sharpe is crucial for practical alpha. The "Fitness / Turnover" ratio is a particularly insightful suggestion. Have you found any specific turnover thresholds where Sharpe starts to become misleading for your typical strategies?

---

### 评论 #38 (作者: NM32020, 时间: 3个月前)

FM47631, that's a fantastic point about the Sharpe ratio's limitations with high turnover. I've also found that looking at the decay of alpha over time, perhaps represented by a rolling correlation of daily returns to some benchmark, can be more revealing than a static Sharpe. It's like a sanity check on the alpha's persistence. Have you experimented with any metrics that try to capture that alpha decay directly?

---

### 评论 #39 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic discussion starter, FM47631. I've also found the Sharpe Ratio to be increasingly misleading in isolation. I'm leaning towards a metric that captures the stability of the alpha's edge, perhaps something like the mean of **cumulative daily returns / cumulative daily volatility**, which attempts to isolate the signal's persistence beyond just total return. What are your thoughts on how spread costs impact metrics like Sharpe vs. Fitness/Turnover in low-latency environments?

---

### 评论 #40 (作者: HH63454, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic discussion point, FM47631. I've also found that raw Sharpe can be misleading, and your focus on "Fitness / Turnover" resonates strongly. I'm curious, have you found any specific thresholds for that ratio that tend to indicate a truly robust alpha, or is it more of a relative comparison between candidates? Perhaps incorporating a measure of factor exposure stability alongside turnover could also offer additional insight into real-world resilience.

---

### 评论 #41 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 3个月前)

Great post, FM47631! I also find myself leaning towards metrics that bake in execution costs implicitly. Have you experimented with looking at risk-adjusted returns *after* a realistic simulation of spread and slippage costs? It feels like a more direct proxy for real-world viability than pure Sharpe, especially for higher-frequency strategies.

---

### 评论 #42 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great point about the limitations of raw Sharpe and the importance of considering operational friction. I've also found that looking at the **maximum drawdown relative to the trailing return over a significant period (e.g., 6-12 months)** can be a robust indicator. It highlights not just profitability but also the capital preservation aspect, which is crucial for identifying truly stable alphas. Have you found any particular lookback periods for your "Fitness/Turnover" ratio that tend to be more predictive?

---

### 评论 #43 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic point, FM47631. I've also found that simply chasing high Sharpe can be misleading, especially with higher turnover strategies that can fall prey to transaction costs. I'm curious, have you found a specific threshold for Fitness/Turnover that generally indicates robustness, or is it more of a relative comparison between alphas?

---

### 评论 #44 (作者: NN89351, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic point, FM47631. The trade-off between raw performance and execution cost is so crucial, and your intuition about "Fitness / Turnover" resonates. Have you found any specific ways to normalize or compare "Fitness / Turnover" across different alphas or trading frequencies, beyond just looking at the ratio? It feels like we're all searching for that robust indicator of genuine signal persistence.

---

### 评论 #45 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great point about the trade-offs inherent in alpha development, FM47631. I also find that "Fitness / Turnover" or similar efficiency metrics are much more telling than raw Sharpe, especially in anticipating real-world friction. Have you found any specific benchmarks for "acceptable" Fitness/Turnover ratios that tend to hold up across different market regimes?

---

### 评论 #46 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 3个月前)

FM47631, this is a fantastic point about the Sharpe ratio's limitations, especially when considering transaction costs. I've also found that a low "Fitness / Turnover" ratio is a strong indicator of an alpha's robustness, as it suggests the signal is persistent and not just a short-lived byproduct of frequent trading. Have you found any specific ranges or thresholds for this ratio that tend to signal a truly "real" alpha?

---

### 评论 #47 (作者: TP85668, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic point, FM47631. I also find raw Sharpe to be misleading and agree that the relationship between profitability and cost is key. Have you found any specific thresholds for Fitness/Turnover that tend to indicate a more robust alpha, or is it more about relative comparison across different strategies? I've been exploring win rates and average return per trade as other potential "North Stars" that might better capture consistency.

---

### 评论 #48 (作者: HH63454, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic point, FM47631. The "Fitness/Turnover" ratio resonates strongly with me as well – it’s a much more practical indicator of an alpha's long-term viability than raw Sharpe, especially when considering transaction costs. I'm curious, have you found any particular thresholds for this ratio that tend to separate "real" alphas from those likely to fade?

---

### 评论 #49 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic point, FM47631. The "Fitness / Turnover" ratio is something I've been increasingly drawn to as well, as it highlights the economic viability of an alpha beyond just raw return generation. Have you found any particular thresholds for this ratio that tend to indicate a more robust alpha, or is it highly dependent on the asset class and trading frequency?

---

### 评论 #50 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic point, FM47631! I've also found that looking beyond raw Sharpe is crucial for practical alpha. I'm increasingly drawn to metrics that incorporate transaction costs directly, like **IC volatility-adjusted by trading volume**, as it seems to capture the underlying signal's endurance under realistic execution. Do you find that incorporating explicit cost proxies like bid-ask spread estimates into your "Fitness/Turnover" ratio significantly changes your alpha selection?

---

### 评论 #51 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic point, FM47631. I've also found that high Sharpe alone can be misleading, especially as spread costs become a larger factor in live trading. I'm curious, have you observed any specific thresholds for the "Fitness / Turnover" ratio that tend to indicate a more robust alpha, or is it more about the relative trend over time? For me, considering the drawdowns in conjunction with that ratio has also been crucial.

---

### 评论 #52 (作者: LA79055, 时间: 3个月前)

The use of Fitness/Turnover as a "North Star" metric for alpha robustness is indeed an insightful approach, especially when evaluating real-world viability. However, I would also emphasize considering  **information ratio**  and  **risk-adjusted returns on capital (RAROC)**  as supplementary metrics. These can provide a more nuanced view by factoring in transaction costs and capital efficiency—critical components when assessing live performance in the context of continuous strategy execution.

---

### 评论 #53 (作者: HT71201, 时间: 3个月前)

I agree that Sharpe alone can be misleading, especially for high-turnover strategies. The Fitness/Turnover ratio seems like a solid proxy for real-world robustness. Do you use any specific thresholds for this ratio, or do you mainly compare it across alphas?
