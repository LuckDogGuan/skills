DEF：bucket(rank(x), range="0, 1, 0.1" or buckets = "2,5,6,7,10")1.rank(x)FunctionPurpose: Performs cross-sectional ranking on the variablex, returning the rank of each stock at a given time point (normalized to[0,1]or[1,N]).Example:rank(close)# Ranks stocks based on closing priceBy default,rank()returns a percentile rank in the range[0,1](where 0 is the minimum and 1 is the maximum).2.bucket(rank(x), range="...")FunctionPurpose: Divides the result ofrank(x)intoquantile bucketsfor group analysis (e.g., deciles, quintiles).Parameters:range="0,1,0.1"→ Divides the range from 0 to 1 into steps of 0.1 (i.e., 10 equal buckets).buckets="2,5,6,7,10"→ Custom bucket boundaries (e.g., 2%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 10% percentiles).Examples:bucket(rank(close),range="0,1,0.1")# Splits into 10 equal groupsbucket(rank(pe_ratio),buckets="0.2,0.5,0.8")# Splits into 4 groups (<20%, 20-50%, 50-80%, >80%)3. Practical Applications in WorldQuant BrainExample 1: Splitting Market Cap into 5 Groups# Computes market cap ranking and splits into 5 equal bucketsbucket(rank(market_cap),range="0,1,0.2")Output: Each stock is assigned a value between 0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, ..., 0.8-1, representing its quantile group.Example 2: Custom Grouping (e.g., Extreme Values Separately)# Splits PE ratio into low, medium, and high groupsbucket(rank(pe_ratio),buckets="0.3,0.7")Grouping Logic:pe_ratiorank <30% → Low PE group30% ≤pe_ratiorank <70% → Medium PE grouppe_ratiorank ≥70% → High PE group4. Common Use CasesFactor Stratified Backtesting: Divides stocks into groups based on a factor (e.g., momentum, valuation) to analyze performance.Outlier Handling: Usesbucket()to identify extreme values (e.g., top/bottom 10% of stocks).Portfolio Construction: Selects stocks in specific quantiles (e.g., top 20% low-volatility stocks).5. Key Notesrank()is cross-sectional by default(ranks all stocks daily).bucket()uses left-inclusive, right-exclusive boundaries(e.g.,[0,0.2)includes 0 but excludes 0.2).WorldQuant Brain may support different parameter formats—check platform docs or usehelp(bucket)for syntax.

Thebucket()function groups ranked data into quantiles or custom ranges for better analysis and portfolio grouping is Very useful.

Thebucket()operator is very useful when you need to discretize a continuous factor into quantile-based groups for stratified analysis or targeted selection. Sincerank()normalizes values to [0,1], applyingbucket(rank(x), range="start,end,step")allows you to split the factor into evenly spaced bins, whilebuckets="p1,p2,...,pn"lets you define custom percentile cutoffs for more nuanced grouping. This is especially helpful for building long-short strategies based on extremes (e.g., top decile vs. bottom decile) or for isolating middle groups to test factor monotonicity. You can also combinebucket()with conditional logic to run group-specific transformations — for instance, applying a momentum calculation only to low-volatility buckets. Just be mindful of how boundaries are treated (left-inclusive, right-exclusive) and verify that your universe size supports the granularity you choose, as very small buckets may cause instability in thin universes.

This post is very helpful for anyone who wants to applybucket()correctly for factor testing and alpha design.
