#### **Signal Concept**

**Core Hypothesis** : Volatility in earnings growth rates across companies can indicate underlying sector-specific risks or opportunities. High earnings volatility often precedes divergence in sector performance due to increased uncertainty or changing fundamentals.

#### **Alpha Signal Framework** :

1. **Earnings Growth Analysis** :
   - Use data fields such as  **EPS growth** ,  **revenue growth** , or  **net income growth**  to evaluate earnings volatility.
   - Identify companies or sectors with high earnings variability over a rolling time window.
2. **Sector Divergence Assessment** :
   - Measure divergence using sector-level metrics like  `ts_stddev(returns, 30)`  or  `ts_skewness(returns, 30)` .
3. **Risk Adjustment** :
   - Adjust the signal for market-level risks using  `market_volatility`  or  `VIX index data` .
4. **Temporal Signal Refinement** :
   - Apply smoothing operators like  `ts_decay_exp_window`  to create a more stable signal over time.

#### **Example Alpha Expression** :

alpha = group_rank(ts_stddev(eps_growth, 60) * ts_skewness(returns, 30), sector) * ts_decay_exp_window(ts_delta(revenue_growth, 20), 5, 0.8)

This Alpha capitalizes on the predictive power of earnings volatility and sector divergence, combining short-term trends with cross-sector dynamics to identify outperformers or underperformers.

Let me know your thoughts or if you'd like additional iterations!

I analyze the relationship between expected future volatility (implied volatility) and expected returns using a dataset focused on small-cap stocks and the top 3000 stocks, with Market as the benchmark. The analysis incorporates volatility-related data, including  **historical volatility, implied volatility for calls and puts, and trading volume** .

A long-short strategy that buys high implied volatility stocks and shorts low implied volatility stocks yields insignificant returns, while a similar strategy using lagged realized volatility produces significantly negative returns. To further investigate risk dynamics, I extract three principal components from  **realized volatility, call-implied volatility, and put-implied volatility** .

Key expressions include:

- **Call Implied Volatility – Put IV spread**  (a proxy for jump risk)
- **Realized Volatility – Implied Volatility spread**  (a proxy for volatility risk)

Significant long-short returns emerge only in the second and third principal components, underscoring their distinct role in return predictability.

**Python** : A versatile language with extensive libraries like  **Pandas**  for data manipulation,  **NumPy**  for numerical computing, and  **Matplotlib/Seaborn**  for visualization. Libraries like  **Scikit-learn**  can help you with machine learning, and  **Statsmodels**  can be used for statistical modeling.

With highly liquid stocks, trades are executed more efficiently, which is important for real-time or high-frequency trading (HFT). Lower transaction costs can significantly improve overall performance.

**Earnings Momentum** : Stocks that outperform or underperform relative to earnings expectations may experience a continuation of that trend, depending on whether the surprise was positive or negative. Incorporating  **momentum**  measures (e.g., price changes post-announcement) helps capture this continuation of trend.

Hey, I love the idea behind your hypothesis on earnings volatility impacting sector divergence! As a newbie in quantitative trading, your approach with ts_stddev and ts_skewness really caught my eye. It’s fascinating how you combine earnings growth analysis with sector metrics. I’m still learning about risk adjustment with market volatility, so your insights on that part would be super helpful. The alpha expression you shared looks great for identifying potential underperformers and outperformers in real-time trading. Looking forward to diving deeper into this. Keep up the great work!

**Why This Is Important:**  Testing your model on Out-of-Sample (OS) data allows you to check how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data, simulating real-world performance. It ensures that your model isn't just memorizing past market behaviors (which would be the case with overfitting) but is able to adapt to new scenarios.

- **Long Positions** : Buying stocks that you expect to increase in value over time.
- **Short Positions** : Selling borrowed stocks that you believe will decrease in value, with the intention of buying them back at a lower price.

This strategy is often used to hedge market risks while capitalizing on relative price movements between stocks.

- **Latency** : Minimize latency in data processing, order execution, and trade settlement. Faster execution times can improve alpha performance, especially in high-frequency strategies.
- **Algorithmic Execution** : Advanced execution algorithms (e.g., VWAP, TWAP, implementation shortfall) can help execute trades more efficiently, minimizing market impact and slippage.

- **Inflation Data** : European inflation data, such as CPI (Consumer Price Index), plays a significant role in EUR value and can be a key alpha signal.
- **GDP Growth** : Economic growth indicators can drive market sentiment. Use  **economic surprise**  data and compare it against market expectations.

**Transaction Cost Awareness in Strategy Design** : Factor in transaction costs when designing the alpha. For instance, if your model suggests frequent trades for marginal gains, it may be worthwhile to adjust the strategy to target larger moves that justify the transaction costs.

This is a really intriguing alpha concept! I love how you've combined earnings volatility with sector-level risk measures to capture divergence—using ts_stddev on eps_growth and ts_skewness on returns offers a fresh perspective on identifying sectors poised for change. The temporal refinement with ts_decay_exp_window adds a nice layer of stability. I'm curious if you've experimented with varying the lookback windows (say, 45 vs. 60 days for eps_growth) to see how sensitive the signal is to those parameters? Overall, it's a clever approach that effectively blends fundamentals with technical signals. Thanks for sharing this innovative idea!

- **Earnings Growth** : This reflects the year-over-year growth in earnings, which can signal the sustainability of the surprise.
- **Revenue Growth** : Similar to earnings growth, but it helps assess whether the earnings surprise is backed by solid revenue increases, which often provides stronger signals for future price movement.

While the framework is strong, sector characteristics may influence the effectiveness of the alpha. For instance, tech and growth sectors may show stronger divergence in response to earnings volatility, whereas utilities or consumer staples might be less sensitive. A sector-adaptive approach, where weights are adjusted based on sector sensitivity, could refine signal effectiveness.

Your approach to linking earnings volatility with sector divergence is strong. However, different sectors react differently to earnings uncertainty. For example, tech and growth sectors often show stronger divergence, while utilities or consumer staples are more defensive. Adapting sector weights based on historical volatility sensitivity could refine the signal and improve performance across different market regimes.

**Earnings Momentum** : Stocks that outperform or underperform relative to earnings expectations may continue that trend, depending on whether the surprise was positive or negative. Incorporating momentum indicators, such as price changes after the announcement, helps capture this continuation of the trend.

### 评论 #32 (作者: VN28696, 时间: 1年前)

This is a solid framework for leveraging earnings volatility in alpha generation! The combination of earnings growth variability, sector divergence, and risk adjustments makes it a well-rounded approach. Using  **ts_stddev**  and  **ts_skewness**  for sector divergence is a great choice, as it helps capture dispersion and potential asymmetries in returns.

One possible enhancement could be incorporating  **relative valuation metrics**  (like P/E or P/S ratios) to filter stocks where earnings volatility might have a stronger predictive effect. Also, checking for  **turnover constraints**  could improve the signal’s robustness in out-of-sample performance.

Would love to hear how this performs in different universes!
