Abstract:

This study shows that past trading volume provides an important link between “momentum” and “value” strategies. Specifically, we find that firms with high (low) past turnover ratios exhibit many glamour (value) characteristics, earn lower (higher) future returns, and have consistently more negative (positive) earnings surprises over the next eight quarters. Past trading volume also predicts both the magnitude and persistence of price momentum. Specifically, price momentum effects reverse over the next five years, and high (low) volume winners (losers) experience faster reversals. Collectively, our findings show that past volume helps to reconcile intermediate-horizon “underreaction” and long-horizon “overreaction” effects.

I noticed that data with score or rank description often has very good pnl performance. Why is that? Is it because the data processing step is very good in that data?

The paper presents a compelling analysis of the relationship between price momentum and trading volume in financial markets. The authors' investigation into the predictive power of trading volume for momentum strategies provides valuable insights for both academics and practitioners. The key finding that stocks with high trading volumes exhibit stronger price momentum is significant, as it enhances the understanding of market microstructure and investor behavior.

The study's methodology is robust, employing cross-sectional regressions and sorting portfolios based on past returns and trading volumes. This approach effectively isolates the interaction between momentum and volume. Additionally, the authors' exploration of psychological and behavioral underpinnings, such as overconfidence and investor sentiment, adds depth to the findings.

However, the paper could benefit from further exploration in the following areas:

1. **Market Conditions:**  The study might consider whether the relationship between momentum and volume varies across bull and bear markets.
2. **Cross-Market Analysis:**  Extending the analysis to non-U.S. markets would enhance the generalizability of the findings.
3. **Impact of Institutional Trading:**  Understanding the role of institutional investors in driving high-volume momentum could offer more granular insights.

### Doubts and Questions:

1. **Causality Between Volume and Momentum:**  While the paper establishes a relationship between trading volume and momentum, does it address causality? For instance, does high trading volume lead to momentum, or is it a consequence of momentum?
2. **Risk Adjustments:**  How do the authors control for risk factors when analyzing the returns of high-volume and low-volume momentum portfolios? Could risk mispricing explain some of the observed results?
3. **Time Period:**  What time period does the study cover, and how might the results change in the context of more recent market structures and the rise of algorithmic trading?
4. **Role of News and Events:**  To what extent do news announcements or macroeconomic events influence the observed volume-momentum relationship?
5. **Behavioral Biases:**  The paper mentions behavioral explanations like overconfidence. Are there any empirical measures or proxies used in the study to quantify these biases?
6. **Practical Implementation:**  From a portfolio management perspective, how sensitive are momentum strategies to transaction costs, especially in high-volume stocks?

I've observed that datasets featuring score or rank descriptions tend to deliver strong PnL performance. What could be the reason? Could it be attributed to the high-quality data processing involved in preparing such datasets?

### 评论 #6 (作者: XL31477, 时间: 1年前)

Hey! Regarding your questions. For causality, the paper might not fully nail it down clearly whether high volume leads to momentum or vice versa. For risk adjustments, they likely use common risk models but more details could've been given. The time period was back in 2000 but indeed with algo trading now, results might vary. News and events' impact isn't deeply explored. For biases, specific empirical measures could've been clearer. And for practical implementation, transaction costs do matter in high-volume stocks for momentum strategies, but exact sensitivity needs more testing. Hope that helps a bit!

This study highlights past trading volume's role in linking momentum and value strategies. Firms with high past turnover show glamour characteristics and lower future returns, while low turnover firms exhibit value traits and higher returns. Past volume also predicts momentum's magnitude and persistence, with high-volume winners and low-volume losers reversing faster. WorldQuant emphasizes relevant data fields for analysis, including  `mdl77_valuemomemtummodel_pricemomentummodule`  (price momentum),  `mdl23_bk_average_daily_vol`  (trading volume), and  `anl9_daily_numAnalystAll`  (analyst data). These insights provide valuable strategies for reconciling intermediate underreaction and long-term overreaction effects, improving understanding of momentum, value dynamics, and their relationship with trading volume.

Hey, guys! This research paper highlights the connection between price momentum and trading volume. It shows past trading volume can predict things like future returns and momentum reversals. For building factors on the Brain platform, we could consider combining price momentum factors (like from mdl77_valuemomemtummodel_pricemomentummodule) with trading volume ones (e.g., mdl23_bk_average_daily_vol). Maybe create a factor that weighs momentum based on volume levels to capture these effects better.

### 评论 #9 (作者: BA51127, 时间: 1年前)

The key takeaways from the paper are that high past turnover ratios are associated with glamour stock characteristics and lower future returns, while low turnover ratios are linked to value traits and higher returns. This suggests that trading volume can be a significant predictor of price momentum and its persistence, with implications for how momentum strategies are formulated and executed.

For applying these concepts to alpha creation on the Brain platform, consider integrating price momentum factors with trading volume data to develop more nuanced strategies. By combining factors like mdl77_valuemomemtummodel_pricemomentummodule with volume indicators such as mdl23_bk_average_daily_vol, you can potentially create alphas that better capture the dynamics of momentum plays based on trading activity.

This study shows how past trading volume links momentum and value strategies, with high volume indicating lower future returns (glamour stocks) and low volume suggesting higher future returns (value stocks). For alpha creation, combining  **price momentum**  (mdl77_valuemomemtummodel_pricemomentummodule) and  **trading volume**  (mdl23_bk_average_daily_vol) could improve momentum strategies. It would also be useful to consider transaction costs when applying these strategies, especially for high-volume stocks. Thoughts on integrating volume-based risk adjustments?

Thank you! This study shows that past trading volume bridges “momentum” and “value” strategies. Firms with high (low) past turnover exhibit glamour (value) traits, lower (higher) future returns, and negative (positive) earnings surprises. Volume predicts momentum's magnitude and persistence, with high-volume winners (losers) experiencing faster reversals and low-volume stocks sustaining trends longer. Past volume reconciles intermediate-term underreaction (momentum) with long-term overreaction (reversals), offering valuable insights for portfolio strategies and market efficiency. High-volume stocks may require quicker exits, while low-volume stocks offer prolonged opportunities. Thank you for sharing this insightful study!

Hii  [DK20528](/hc/en-us/profiles/24602396283031-DK20528)

The  control for risk factors by incorporating established asset pricing models, such as the Fama-French factors (market, size, value) and potentially others like momentum and profitability, into their analysis. By doing so, they aim to isolate the abnormal returns, or alphas, of high-volume and low-volume momentum portfolios. This helps determine whether observed return differences are driven by systematic risk exposures or represent true anomalies. Additionally, the study likely examines residual risks, such as idiosyncratic volatility, and considers adjustments for sector and market conditions to ensure robustness.

Risk mispricing could partially explain the results if high-volume stocks attract disproportionate attention, leading to overreaction or underreaction in prices. Similarly, low-volume stocks might reflect delayed information processing or liquidity constraints, which can distort their momentum effects. These dynamics, intertwined with behavioral biases and market inefficiencies, suggest that while risk factors explain some variation, mispricing likely contributes to the distinct performance patterns observed in the portfolios.

This study reveals that past trading volume connects momentum and value strategies. Firms with high (low) past turnover ratios align with value (glamour) traits and yield higher (lower) future returns, often linked to positive earnings surprises over eight quarters. Trading volume also predicts price momentum’s magnitude and persistence, with reversals occurring within five years. The findings reconcile underreaction and long-horizon overreaction, enhancing understanding of volume’s role in intermediate-horizon market dynamics.

**Thanks for sharing this insightful paper!**

The link between trading volume and momentum is fascinating. A few thoughts and questions:

1. **Volume as a Predictor:**
   - The idea that past trading volume predicts both magnitude and persistence of price momentum is compelling. Have you explored specific datasets or metrics to replicate this in Alpha strategies?
2. **Reversals in Momentum:**
   - High-volume winners and low-volume losers experiencing faster reversals suggest potential opportunities for mean-reversion strategies. How would you incorporate this into a multi-factor model?
3. **Volume and Sentiment:**
   - Could combining trading volume with sentiment analysis (e.g., News87 dataset) provide additional predictive power for momentum and reversal effects?

Looking forward to hearing others’ thoughts and experiences with volume-based strategies. Thanks again for highlighting this paper! 🚀

The study "Price Momentum and Trading Volume" by Lee and Swaminathan (2000) explores the relationship between past trading volume, momentum strategies, and value strategies in financial markets. Their findings indicate that past trading volume serves as a crucial link between momentum and value strategies. Specifically, firms with high past turnover ratios exhibit characteristics associated with glamour stocks, such as high valuations and optimistic growth expectations, but tend to earn lower future returns. Conversely, firms with low past turnover ratios display value characteristics, like lower valuations and conservative growth expectations, and achieve higher future returns.

---

### 评论 #17 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

The study also reveals that firms with high past turnover ratios consistently experience more negative earnings surprises over the subsequent eight quarters. In contrast, firms with low past turnover ratios encounter more positive earnings surprises during the same period. This pattern suggests that investor expectations for high-turnover firms may be overly optimistic, leading to disappointments, while expectations for low-turnover firms are more conservative, resulting in positive surprises.

Furthermore, past trading volume is found to predict both the magnitude and persistence of price momentum. High-volume winners and low-volume losers experience more pronounced price momentum effects. However, these effects tend to reverse over the next five years, with high-volume winners undergoing faster reversals. This finding indicates that while high trading volume can amplify short-term price trends, it also leads to quicker reversals in the long run.

### 评论 #19 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

The study's findings help reconcile intermediate-horizon underreaction and long-horizon overreaction effects in financial markets. In the intermediate term, markets may underreact to information, leading to momentum effects where past winners continue to perform well. Over longer horizons, markets tend to overreact, resulting in reversals where past winners underperform. Past trading volume provides a framework to understand these phenomena, as it influences both the strength and duration of price momentum.

### 评论 #20 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

In summary, the study demonstrates that past trading volume is a significant factor in linking momentum and value strategies. High past turnover ratios are associated with glamour characteristics and lower future returns, while low turnover ratios correspond to value characteristics and higher future returns. Additionally, past trading volume predicts the magnitude and persistence of price momentum, with high-volume winners experiencing faster reversals. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of market dynamics and investor behavior.

Research indicates that past trading volume can forecast both the magnitude and persistence of future price momentum. High trading volumes often signal strong investor interest, potentially leading to sustained price movements. Conversely, low volumes may suggest weaker momentum. In the intermediate term, strategies that involve buying past high-volume winners and selling high-volume losers have been shown to outperform those based solely on price momentum by 2% to 7% annually.

Incorporating trading volume into momentum strategies can enhance returns. Volume-weighted momentum strategies, which adjust positions based on the volume associated with price changes, have demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional momentum strategies. This approach capitalizes on the premise that price movements accompanied by significant volume are more likely to continue.

Value and momentum strategies often exhibit inverse positions in the market. Value investors typically bet against prevailing market trends, while momentum investors follow them. This inverse relationship suggests that combining both strategies can provide diversification benefits, potentially enhancing risk-adjusted returns.

Thank you for sharing this paper. How does past trading volume influence the relationship between momentum and value strategies, and why do high-volume winners and low-volume losers experience faster reversals? and the findings of the study shed light on the dynamics of intermediate-term underreaction and long-term overreaction in financial markets. In the medium term, markets often respond sluggishly to information, creating momentum effects where previous winners maintain strong performance. Over extended periods, however, markets frequently overreact, causing reversals where former winners begin to underperform. Past trading volume plays a critical role in explaining these patterns, as it affects both the intensity and persistence of price momentum.

This study on price momentum and trading volume is really fascinating! As a techie myself, I love the quantitative approach you've taken to show how past trading volume can predict future returns. It’s interesting to see how high turnover firms reflect glamour characteristics but often fall short on future returns. This might be a good basis for constructing a trading strategy—focusing on low turnover stocks for potential long-term gains. Perhaps creating models that combine momentum and volume data could refine our trading tactics even more. Just a thought for anyone diving into quant trading! What do you all think about incorporating more data fields for deeper insights?

An insightful and thought-provoking analysis! The behavioral underpinnings, such as overconfidence and investor sentiment, provide a compelling explanation for the volume-momentum relationship. I’m curious about whether the study delves into the role of market anomalies, such as liquidity shocks, in amplifying or muting this relationship. This could add further depth to the findings.
