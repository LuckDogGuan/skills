# Main Post

I see many people getting stuck at  **pyramid requirements** , especially when submission-quality alphas are not stable.

Here is a practical approach that works consistently for me.

## Core idea

> Don’t start from “perfect alpha”.
> Start from  **easy-to-pass pipelines** , then scale.

## Step 1 — Start from  `{model}`  dataset

This is the highest leverage step.

Why:

- Signal is already pre-processed
- Lower noise than raw datasets
- Easier to reach  **Sharpe ≥ 1**

Typical structure:

```
rank(ts_mean(model_feature, d))

```

or

```
group_rank(model_feature, subindustry)

```

Goal:

👉  **Quickly generate “submittable” alphas, not perfect ones**

## Step 2 — Use PowerPool strategically

PowerPool requirements are low:

- ≤ 8 operators
- ≤ 3 data fields
- Sharpe ≥ 1
- Basic checks (Fitness, Turnover, Sub-universe)

→ This is ideal for  **pyramid solving**

## What PowerPool is really good for

- Fast iteration
- Low complexity alpha
- High pass rate
- Occasional pyramid unlocks

Not for:

- Long-term edge
- Complex signal design

## Step 3 — Choose easier regions first

Region selection matters more than most people think.

### Easier:

- ASI
- TWN

### Harder:

- USA
- IND

Reason:

- USA → highly efficient
- IND → unstable / noisy
- ASI / TWN → more exploitable patterns

## Practical workflow

1. Generate 10–20 simple alphas from  `{model}`
2. Run on ASI / TWN
3. Filter:
   - Sharpe ≥ 1
   - Stable turnover
4. Submit to PowerPool
5. Accumulate pyramid progress

## Common mistake

Trying to:

> “build one perfect alpha to solve everything”

This fails because:

- Overfitting risk increases
- Sub-universe fails (Japan, USA, etc.)
- Iteration speed drops

## My takeaway

Pyramid is a  **throughput problem** , not a brilliance problem.

- More simple alphas
- Faster iteration
- Higher pass probability

## Questions

### Q1

Do you prioritize:

A. High-quality alpha
B. High-volume simple alpha

### Q2

Has anyone consistently solved pyramid using:

👉 non-model datasets only?

### Q3

Any region ranking from your experience?
(Which region is easiest → hardest?)

## Optional comment seeds

**Q: Isn’t this too “low quality”?** 
A: Yes, but pyramid is a constraint problem, not a research purity problem.

**Q: Does this scale to long-term performance?** 
A: Not directly. This is for unlocking capacity first.

**Q: Why not USA?** 
A: Too competitive. Hard to pass consistently with simple signals.

Great post, AW78627! Your emphasis on starting with {model} data and leveraging PowerPool for rapid iteration is a fantastic point, especially for tackling the initial pyramid hurdles. It makes a lot of sense to view pyramid solving as a throughput challenge rather than solely a "brilliance" one. Regarding Q1, I'm curious if your experience also shows that the optimal balance between quality and volume shifts depending on your current stage in the pyramid progress? And for Q3, your region ranking aligns with mine; I've found ASI and TWN to be significantly more forgiving initially.

This is a fantastic breakdown of a pragmatic approach to pyramid solving, AW78627! I particularly resonate with the idea of starting with simpler alphas from the `{model}` dataset and leveraging PowerPool for rapid iteration. It completely shifts the focus from chasing that one perfect alpha to building momentum through volume and faster feedback loops. My follow-up question would be regarding your experience with specific feature combinations from `{model}` that tend to yield these high-pass-rate, low-operator alphas for initial PowerPool submissions.

This is a fantastic breakdown of a practical pyramid-solving strategy. I particularly resonate with the idea of prioritizing throughput over single-alpha brilliance; it truly highlights the iterative nature of quant development. For Q2, I've found non-model datasets significantly harder to achieve consistent Sharpe, but perhaps with very specific feature engineering and a focus on very short lookbacks? I'm curious if you've experimented with combining simpler {model} alphas with a few select non-model features to see if that offers a sweet spot for pyramid progress.

This is a fantastic practical framework for tackling the pyramid! I particularly resonate with the "throughput problem, not a brilliance problem" takeaway. Focusing on generating many simple, submittable alphas first on easier regions seems like a much more robust strategy than chasing a single perfect alpha. For Q2, I'm curious if anyone has seen success using *only* raw datasets with a similar incremental approach, perhaps by focusing on very short lookbacks initially.

Great post, AW78627! This strategy of prioritizing throughput and starting with simpler, {model}-based alphas for PowerPool is a fantastic way to navigate the pyramid. I'm curious, have you found any specific feature engineering tricks on the {model} dataset that have particularly high leverage for generating those initial submittable alphas?

This is a really practical breakdown of a common bottleneck in alpha development. I appreciate the emphasis on throughput over singular "perfect" alphas; that resonates strongly with my own experience. Regarding Q1, I lean heavily towards B, as speed and iteration seem key to unlocking progress. Have you found specific operator combinations or data transformations within the {model} dataset that consistently yield good starting points for submittable alphas?

This is a fantastic breakdown of a pragmatic approach to tackling the pyramid! I particularly resonate with starting from the `{model}` dataset and leveraging PowerPool for quick wins. My follow-up question is regarding your region ranking: have you observed any significant differences in the *type* of exploitable patterns between ASI/TWN and the harder regions, or is it purely a matter of noise and efficiency?

### 评论 #12 (作者: NM98411, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a very pragmatic approach, AW78627. I particularly resonate with the idea of treating Pyramid as a throughput problem. My experience suggests that focusing on rapid iteration with simple, submittable alphas, especially on easier regions like ASI, is key to building momentum. For Q2, I haven't personally seen consistent Pyramid success solely from non-model datasets, but I'm curious if others have found specific, robust features in those datasets that lend themselves to low-operator, high-Sharpe alphas.

### 评论 #13 (作者: HT71201, 时间: 3个月前)

Great point—throughput over single-alpha brilliance makes sense. For Q2, have you tried combining simple {model} alphas with a few non-model features? That mix might be a good balance.

This is a fantastic breakdown of a practical approach to tackling pyramid requirements, AW78627! Your emphasis on starting with simpler {model} features and strategically leveraging PowerPool for rapid iteration really resonates. I particularly like the insight that pyramid solving is more about throughput than individual brilliance – that's a crucial perspective shift for many. I'm curious, have you found specific patterns within the {model} dataset that tend to yield more stable Sharpe ratios in the initial PowerPool submissions, perhaps related to momentum or mean-reversion characteristics?
