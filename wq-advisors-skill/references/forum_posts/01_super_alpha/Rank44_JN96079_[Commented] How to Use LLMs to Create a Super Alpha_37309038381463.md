Hello everyone,

In a recent webinar, I noticed that the admin presented an approach for using  **LLMs**  to generate a  **Super Alpha** . I’d like to understand this concept in more depth—specifically, the  **two–AI-agent model**  that was mentioned.

Could someone explain more clearly the  **roles, responsibilities, and functions of each agent**  within this framework?

Thank you everyone for your explanations and insights.

The two-agent LLM approach typically involves a "generator" agent that creates alpha expressions based on prompts or market hypotheses, and a "critic" agent that evaluates those expressions for logic errors, overfitting risks, or implementation issues. The generator proposes ideas using natural language reasoning translated into Brain syntax, while the critic provides feedback on feasibility, data requirements, and potential weaknesses before submission. This iterative loop helps refine ideas programmatically. However, I haven't seen detailed documentation on this specific workflow - have you checked the webinar recording or asked support for implementation examples?

In the two–AI-agent setup, roles are typically split clearly:  **Agent 1 (Idea/Research Agent)**  focuses on translating economic intuition into diverse, low-correlation ATOM alpha candidates, while  **Agent 2 (Validation/Engineering Agent)**  stress-tests robustness, correlation, OS stability, and combines suitable ATOMs into a Super Alpha. The LLM doesn’t create edge by itself—it accelerates idea generation and screening, with humans still guiding intuition and making final decisions.

Great question — the two-AI-agent setup is meant to separate  *idea generation*  from  *evaluation and control* , which mirrors how experienced researchers work.

The  **first agent (Generator / Creative agent)**  is responsible for exploration. Its role is to propose candidate alpha ideas, expressions, or transformations based on prompts like themes, datasets, or market hypotheses. This agent is intentionally allowed to be broad and even speculative — it can combine operators, suggest parameter ranges, or propose interaction ideas without worrying too much about robustness. Think of it as the “junior researcher” that produces raw hypotheses at scale.

The  **second agent (Critic / Validator agent)**  acts as a filter and disciplinarian. Its job is to review the generated ideas and assess them against constraints such as economic intuition, turnover, neutrality, parameter sensitivity, crowding risk, and known failure modes (overfitting, look-ahead bias, magic constants, etc.). This agent decides which ideas are worth simulating, how they should be stress-tested, or whether they should be rejected outright. In some implementations, it also suggests refinements like adding decay, normalization, or neutralization.

When combined into a  **Super Alpha workflow** , the generator expands the idea space efficiently, while the validator aggressively contracts it, ensuring that only clean, interpretable, and robust signals move forward. The key benefit is not automation of alpha discovery, but  *discipline at scale* : creativity without filtering produces noise, while filtering without creativity stagnates. The two-agent model keeps both in balance.

In practice, the strongest setups still keep a human in the loop — using intuition to guide prompts, override rejections, and decide when a signal genuinely reflects a structural market effect rather than a statistical artifact.

The two-agent setup usually separates creativity from validation. One LLM explores the alpha/search space broadly, while the second evaluates stability, redundancy, and whether the SuperAlpha logic actually makes sense.
