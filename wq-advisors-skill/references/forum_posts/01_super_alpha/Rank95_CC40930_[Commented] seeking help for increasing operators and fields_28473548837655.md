Hello. I think you can first read the article Detailed Operator Descriptions to better understand how to use the operators:

[https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/operators/detailed-operator-descriptions](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/operators/detailed-operator-descriptions)

It is quite difficult for you to want to increase the operator and decrease op/alpha at the same time, because these 2 indexes are going against each other. You should choose 1 of the 2 indexes and then optimize, it might be better.

Hi  [KI68572](/hc/en-us/profiles/24044467872023-KI68572) , I agree with  [TN48752](/hc/en-us/profiles/13714359745431-TN48752)  that it can be difficult to optimize for both at the same time. But you can try a new operator in every alpha going forward to increase the operator count while keeping the operators per alpha in check. You will need to understand the new operators well in order to use them effectively.

Cheers!

Hi! Agree with  [TN48752](/hc/en-us/profiles/13714359745431-TN48752) .

Try to get deep understanding of all operators available and how they impact produced weights. Some operators can be re-created using other operators.

Hi KI68572, you can find more usable operators in Learn section , use more operators to bring diversity in your alphas.

Yes I am Agree with  [TN48752](/hc/en-us/profiles/13714359745431-TN48752) .

Learn as much as you can about the various operators and how they affect the weights that are produced.

It is quite difficult to simultaneously increase the total number of operators used while decreasing the operators per alpha. Balancing this requires strategic design, such as creating multiple simple alphas with fewer operators. This approach ensures each alpha remains efficient while collectively utilizing more operators.

You should try to familiar with every operators. There are some operator which is simple and fit with almost type of data, but to increase total number of operators you need to learn others. Try to use script to learn idea and type of data: eg: tradewhen work with new/ high turnover data; skewness and kurtosis to filter initial distribution.

Hi KI68572,

It’s great to hear about your progress with 30 pyramids and 120 signals—impressive work! Regarding your question, balancing the number of operators and reducing operators per alpha can indeed be challenging since these goals often conflict. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Understand Operators Deeply** : As TN48752 mentioned, reviewing the  [Detailed Operator Descriptions](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/operators/detailed-operator-descriptions)  is a great start. It will help you identify operators that can be replaced or combined more efficiently.
2. **Prioritize One Metric** : Decide whether increasing the total number of operators or reducing the operators per alpha is more critical for your strategy. Once you focus on one metric, you can optimize your approach more effectively.
3. **Operator Optimization** : Explore combinations of operators to see if some can be re-created using others, as AG20578 suggested. This can reduce redundancy while maintaining flexibility in your alpha generation process.
4. **Experiment with Templates** : If possible, revise your templates to ensure they’re not overly reliant on certain operators. This might free up space for additional operators or reduce the count per alpha.
5. **Feedback Iteration** : Review the performance of your existing alphas and identify operators that might not significantly contribute to their predictive power. Removing less effective operators could allow you to add more diverse ones.

To reduce the number of operators and fields per alpha while maintaining the effectiveness of your signals, you can try the following tips:

1. **Simplify Operators**:  

   - **Consolidate similar operators**: Look for redundancies in your operators. For example, if you are using multiple moving averages, try reducing them to just one or two key types (e.g., a 50-day SMA for trend-following or EMA for more sensitivity).

   - **Focus on key indicators**: Prioritize the most impactful operators for your strategy. Instead of using many complex indicators, choose a few that provide the most relevant signals for your alpha’s logic (e.g., price momentum + volume or volatility indicators).

2. **Use Feature Engineering**:  

   - **Aggregate data**: Instead of using too many fields, try aggregating or transforming them into single, meaningful features (e.g., combining multiple price-related fields into a single "price momentum" or "trend strength" field).

   - **Dimensionality reduction**: Use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of input features without losing important information.

3. **Focus on Essential Fields**:  

   - **Limit the number of fields**: Try to focus on the most critical fields related to the underlying strategy. Avoid using fields that offer redundant or overlapping information.

   - **Correlation Check**: If you have multiple fields that are highly correlated, consider removing one. For example, if both "moving average" and "price trend" are highly correlated, choose the one that gives the best predictive power.

4. **Optimize Your Alpha Logic**:  

   - **Refine alpha logic**: If your logic is too complex, simplify it. A straightforward alpha can often be more effective than one with many conditions and complex calculations.

   - **Backtest for simplicity**: Test reduced models to see if you can achieve similar performance with fewer operators and fields. Often, a simpler alpha performs just as well or even better.

By reducing the complexity of your alphas, you can make them more efficient without sacrificing predictive power. This also makes your models easier to maintain and less prone to overfitting.

Balancing operator count and efficiency is challenging, focus on one goal at a time. Simplify redundant operators, understand their impact, and refine alphas for better results.

By optimizing the way you combine, reuse, and parameterize your operators, you can increase the number of unique alpha signals you generate without exceeding the operator limit. Focus on flexibility, general-purpose operations, and reusing components effectively. This will allow you to generate 120 signals using only 50 operators by minimizing redundancy and maximizing the utility of each operator.

Hi KI68572, it's impressive that you've completed 30 pyramids and submitted 120 signals! As a beginner, I know how tricky it can be to juggle increasing the number of operators while reducing the operators per alpha. I recommend taking a deep dive into the Detailed Operator Descriptions. Understanding operators is crucial, and you might find some that can replace multiples you’re using. Prioritize one goal at a time, either increase operators or optimize alpha efficiency. Simplifying your strategy can lead to better performance without overwhelming your setup. Good luck!

**Moving on to more complex ideas** , such as  `(-1 * rank(Ts_Rank(close, 5)) * rank(close / open))` , is a nice next step. It combines price ranks and the relationship between the open and close prices, which can help uncover deeper patterns. This type of approach allows you to explore different aspects of price behavior, like trend strength or volatility, which can be quite valuable for building predictive signals.

By focusing on one optimization at a time, you’ll have a clearer path to achieving the best results based on your specific goals.

It sounds like you're making great progress with your pyramids and signals! To increase your operator count, have you considered optimizing the way your alphas are structured? Perhaps refining your models or exploring different strategies could help you use fewer operators per alpha, allowing you to expand your capacity.
