Hi everyone,

🎉 Exciting news regarding the newly onboarded universes! With the addition of  **USA TOP2000** ,  **ASI TOP500** ,  **ASI MINVOL10M** , and  **GLB MINVOL10M** , I’m curious to see how everyone is adapting their research workflows. These open up some great opportunities, but also bring new challenges for signal durability.

Here is what I am currently testing as I port my existing alphas over:

**1. The Built-in Liquidity Filter (MINVOL10M)**  For the  `GLB MINVOL10M`  and  `ASI MINVOL10M`  universes, having a strict 10 million minimum volume constraint baked in is a huge time-saver. In the past, applying complex mean-reversion signals to global datasets often resulted in great In-Sample scores that instantly collapsed Out-of-Sample (OS) due to illiquid micro-caps skewing the results. I'm finding that I can relax some of my manual  `adv20`  filters when building for these universes, allowing the model to breathe a bit more.

**2. Rethinking Neutralization for USA TOP2000**  Expanding into the  `USA TOP2000`  provides a much wider playground than the Top 500, but it introduces a lot of mid-cap volatility. I'm noticing that my standard risk-neutralization techniques (which worked fine on mega-caps) are struggling slightly here. To maintain OS performance, I'm having to apply much stricter  `group_neutralize`  functions specifically targeting Sub-Industries rather than just broad Sectors.

**3. Cross-Regional Signal Robustness**  I'm currently running an experiment: taking alphas that show strong, risk-neutralized OS performance in the US and running them directly on  `ASI TOP500`  without changing the core expression. The decay rates are vastly different, suggesting that alpha half-lives in the Asian markets require different  `decay_linear`  parameters.

I’d love to hear your initial findings:

- Have you found that your Sharpe ratios naturally improve in the  `MINVOL10M`  universes due to the exclusion of low-liquidity noise?
- Are you building entirely new expressions for  `USA TOP2000` , or just adjusting the risk/decay parameters of your existing signals?

Looking forward to the discussion!

New universe will help with prod correlation and also balancing tier breaker

solid insights, this will really help to counter production correlation especially in USA region.

Minimum volatility universe construction is fundamentally different from liquidity-based construction and opens genuinely distinct research territory. MINVOL10M selects for low volatility names with minimum liquidity threshold — which creates a universe with different factor exposure characteristics, different return distribution properties, and different crowding dynamics than standard liquidity-ranked universes.

Yes, expanding to USA TOP2000 helps reduce prod correlation. I also found that sub-industry  `group_neutralize`  is necessary to handle the added mid-cap volatility
