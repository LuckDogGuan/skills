- check PnL and Sharpe visualizations for capitalization, sector, country (if applicable) and ensure there is diversity; and also ensure weight is distributed well

- high margin and decent sharpe ( > 1.75 for most regions, but > 2/2.25 for regions like GLB, ASI, EUR Top2500)

There should be a high returns to drawdown ratio. The fitness should be high and the alpha should perform well on sub and super universes. I also try to look for alphas that have a sharpe of >0.5 for each of the years that the backtesting has occurred.

Good alphas can be identified through several key qualities derived from the In-Sample (IS) summary. First, a strong alpha should exhibit a high returns-to-drawdown ratio, indicating that it generates significant returns relative to the risks taken. Additionally, a high fitness score suggests that the alpha is robust and well-optimized for the data it was tested on.

Once an alpha passes the key IS metrics like Sharpe, turnover, fitness, and returns, it's helpful to further explore the  **Visualizations**  section for deeper insights. You can examine how stable the  **turnover**  is over time, which gives clues about the alpha’s consistency. Also, check whether the  **capitalization is well-distributed**  across different sectors—this ensures the alpha isn't overly reliant on a single group. Additionally, it’s usually better if  **more capital is allocated to highly liquid stocks** , as these are easier to trade and less sensitive to market impact. In that regard,  **high-liquidity stocks should ideally have strong Sharpe ratios** , indicating robust signals. On the other hand, Sharpe ratios for low-liquidity stocks should not be too low, as excessive underperformance in those names can drag down the overall alpha. These extra visual checks can help validate that your alpha is not just statistically solid but also practically scalable and reliable.

Hi👋 I only joined WQ recently,

but just by focusing on this, I was able to boost my  **Value Factor from 0.5 to 0.97!**

Actually,  **you don’t need each individual Alpha to have a very high Sharpe ratio** —that’s a common misconception. At WQ, what really matters is the  *Combined Portfolio*  performance, meaning how your Alphas work together as a whole.

Of course, Sharpe > 2 is still ideal, and it's important to  **pay attention to  *recent years’ performance*** , since we want to avoid submitting signals that fade quickly or may not perform well in future markets.

Personally, I like to submit Alphas with a Margin-to-Drawdown ratio above 5,
like 160/30 or 10/2—but that’s not a hard rule. It’s good to try different Turnover levels, but aiming for an average around 10–15% usually works well.

There’s still so much to explore, especially when it comes to IS...

I'M LISTING DOWN A FEW METHODS WHICH I CONSIDER WHILE SUBMITTING ANY ALPHA

1. return/drawdown > 2 (atleast)

2. Optimal turnover range (between 10 to 20)

3. Submit alpha in the subindustry region for best results, as it works for a small universe.

For IS, prioritize sharpe, fitness, margin must be high.
Details:
USA: Sharpe > 2.0, fitness >=1., margin >= 16., turnover < 25.
"For PPAC: (Sharpe [2.5, Inf] -> submit), (Sharpe[1., 1.5] -> do not submit)"
The remaining regions: Shapre >= 1.8, fitness >= 1., margin >= 12., turnover <= 30. -> submit
However, still prioritize submitting alpha with high IS, diverse datasets, do not try to optimize alpha to the threshold of overfit.
Priority order: Sharpe -> Margin -> Return -> Fitness -> Turnover -> Drawdown

QUALITIES OF GOOD ALPHAS

#### 1.  **Statistically Significant Predictive Power**

- The model must  **consistently predict returns better than chance** .
- High  **t-stats** ,  **p-values < 0.05** , and strong  **out-of-sample R²**  matter.

#### 2.  **Out-of-Sample Performance**

- Good alpha models perform well not just on  **backtests** , but on  **live or unseen data** .
- Avoids  **overfitting**  (aka curve-fitting) where the model memorizes history instead of learning patterns.

#### 3.  **High Sharpe Ratio / Risk-Adjusted Returns**

- Not just raw return — you want  **return per unit of risk**  to be high.
- Other metrics:  **Information Ratio** ,  **Sortino Ratio** ,  **Max Drawdown** .

Hey  [DD24306](/hc/en-us/profiles/18328015817751-DD24306)

I'm not sure how you conclude this priority order, it doesn't matter if you submit an alpha with 20% return if it has a drawdown of 30%.

Everything has equal priority according to me, you just need to find a right balance before submitting an alpha.

Low Overfitting
: 

Good alphas are not the result of excessive parameter tuning or data mining. They should retain performance when tested on unseen data (OS Sharpe close to IS Sharpe).

Avoiding overfitting is crucial: alphas that perform well only in-sample but degrade sharply out-of-sample are not reliable !

**Reasonable Turnover and Tradability** 
Alphas with extremely high turnover may not be tradable after costs. Good alphas balance turnover and profit, maintaining performance after accounting for transaction costs.

They should be designed with practical constraints in mind, such as liquidity and market impact

### 评论 #13 (作者: SC43474, 时间: 1年前)

Great thread! Here's a consolidated checklist of qualities to look for in  **good alphas based on IS summary**  and visual diagnostics:

1. **Sharpe Ratio**
   - Aim for Sharpe > 2.0 (USA), > 1.8 (other regions)
   - Year-by-year Sharpe should be consistently > 0.5
2. **Return-to-Drawdown Ratio**
   - Ideally > 2, but > 5 is excellent
   - Focus on stable and controlled drawdowns
3. **Fitness Score**
   - Should be ≥ 1.0 for robustness
   - High fitness = better optimization for the backtest period
4. **Margin and Returns**
   - Margin ≥ 12–16 depending on region
   - Look for high cumulative returns with stable growth
5. **Turnover**
   - Optimal range: 10–20% (up to 25–30% max)
   - Avoid excessive turnover for better tradability after costs
6. **Diversification**
   - Ensure alpha works across capitalizations, sectors, and subindustries
   - Avoid concentration in a single group or illiquid stocks
7. **Liquidity Sensitivity**
   - Strong Sharpe in high-liquidity stocks
   - Acceptable performance in low-liquidity names without sharp underperformance
8. **Scalability & Tradability**
   - Favor alphas that allocate capital to liquid stocks
   - Consider how the signal behaves under real-world constraints
9. **Combined Alpha Strategy Compatibility**
   - Even if individual Sharpe is modest, ensure it adds unique value to your portfolio
   - Low correlation with existing alphas boosts portfolio diversity
10. **Avoid Overfitting**

- Don’t over-optimize just to meet thresholds—look for stable patterns over time

Thanks everyone for the fantastic insights! This helps both new and experienced users fine-tune their alpha submission criteria.

Hey  [HT59568](/hc/en-us/profiles/27161322138391-HT59568)

What's the ideal turnover range for improving CAP? Can you please explain it with logic why high turnover alphas might not be good fit for tradable after cost?

---

### 评论 #15 (作者: PK46713, 时间: 1年前)

The consistency of Sharpe over time often matters more than peak Sharpe. I've seen alphas with a high cumulative Sharpe, but when you break it down year-by-year, they underperform in specific market regimes. A strong alpha should ideally show Sharpe > 0.5 each year across different market environments. That kind of time-series robustness indicates structural predictive power rather than overfitting to a specific period.

Hi  [ST37368](/hc/en-us/profiles/4927283487127-ST37368) .

From my point of view,high turnover brings about transaction costs impact, since high turnover alphas incur significantly more transaction costs because they trade more frequently. These costs directly erode returns, sometimes completely eliminating or even reversing alpha profitability.

Happy to hear others suggestions.

### 评论 #17 (作者: KK32415, 时间: 1年前)

We need to look at Sharpe consistency year-by-year (as many pointed out, Sharpe > 0.5 each year is a great heuristic). I’ve also found that checking the standard deviation of Sharpe over years gives a good idea of robustness. High average Sharpe with high year-to-year variance often means regime sensitivity. Low standard deviation = more stable signal.

---

### 评论 #18 (作者: AC34118, 时间: 1年前)

### 1.  **Strong and Consistent Alpha Generation**

- **High Annual Return:**  Suggests the strategy consistently outperforms the benchmark.
- **High Alpha (in CAPM):**  Indicates performance independent of market returns.
- **Sharpe Ratio > 1.5 (preferably > 2.0):**  Risk-adjusted return is strong.

### 🪙 2.  **Robust Risk Management**

- **Low Drawdown:**  Especially  **Max Drawdown**  – a smaller number indicates the strategy doesn't suffer large losses.

### 🔁 3.  **Low Turnover (Depending on Strategy)**

- **Reasonable Turnover Rate:**  Very high turnover = high transaction costs, possibly overfitting. But this depends—some HFT strategies are naturally high turnover.

### 评论 #19 (作者: TD37298, 时间: 1年前)

While standard in-sample metrics such as Sharpe ratio, returns, fit, and profitability are crucial, further visualization offers deeper understanding. Examining the stability of returns over time reveals alpha consistency, and checking capital allocation across sectors ensures diversification. Prioritizing liquid stocks with strong Sharpe ratios, while avoiding excessively weak Sharpe ratios in illiquid names, enhances scalability and reliability. These visual checks validate statistical robustness and practical viability.

---

### 评论 #20 (作者: NH16784, 时间: 1年前)

In my opinion, there are only 2 things to watch out for:
1. Turnover: Keep turnover < 20%; too high turnover when adding fees will erase all performance alpha
2. 2Y-sharpe: An alpha with a high 2Y-sharpe does not necessarily have a high OS, but an alpha with a 2Y-sharpe is 90% likely to have a low OS.

---

### 评论 #21 (作者: RP41479, 时间: 1年前)

Prioritize alphas with high IS Sharpe, diverse datasets, and avoid overfitting.

**USA** : Sharpe > 2.0, Fitness ≥ 1, Margin ≥ 16, Turnover < 25
 **PPAC** : Submit if Sharpe ≥ 2.5, skip if Sharpe in [1.0, 1.5]
 **Others** : Sharpe ≥ 1.8, Fitness ≥ 1, Margin ≥ 12, Turnover ≤ 30

**Priority** : Sharpe > Margin > Return > Fitness > Turnover > Drawdown

### 评论 #22 (作者: TD37298, 时间: 1年前)

When alpha demonstrates significant outperformance across key investment strategy (IS) metrics, including Sharpe ratio, revenue generation, model fit, and profitability, further granular analysis through advanced visualization techniques is warranted to extract deeper, actionable insights. It is prudent to evaluate the temporal stability of revenue streams to ascertain the consistency and robustness of the generated alpha. Moreover, a thorough examination of capital allocation efficacy across diverse sectors is crucial to ensure that alpha generation is not excessively concentrated within a singular sector or thematic exposure.

Optimally, a greater capital commitment should be directed towards highly liquid securities, given their enhanced tradability and reduced susceptibility to market impact. Concurrently, these high-liquidity constituents should ideally exhibit strong Sharpe ratios, indicative of compelling risk-adjusted return profiles. Conversely, the Sharpe ratios of less liquid holdings should be carefully monitored to avoid excessively low values, as significant underperformance in these less liquid names can detract from overall portfolio alpha. These supplementary visual analytics serve to corroborate the statistical robustness of the alpha signal and assess its potential for scalability and practical implementation.

When reviewing an  **In-Sample (IS) summary** , you can infer several key qualities of a strong alpha. top qualities to look for, and how they typically show up in an IS summary:

### **ow Correlation with Benchmark or Other Alphas**

- **What it indicates:**  Unique signal, potential for portfolio diversification.
- **Measured by:**  Correlation metrics in the IS summary or orthogonality.

---

### 评论 #24 (作者: 顾问 TN48242 (Rank 82), 时间: 1年前)

Great question! When analyzing the IS (In-Sample) summary, several qualities can help identify strong alphas. First, a consistently high Sharpe ratio, especially across multiple regions or universes, shows robustness. Alphas with low drawdowns and a high margin-to-drawdown ratio (like >5) are generally more reliable. Stability of performance over time is also key — avoid signals that spike and fade quickly. Check for low turnover if you want more investable signals, though some high-turnover alphas may still work if margin is high. Furthermore, low correlation to existing alphas makes your submission more valuable for combined strategies. IS consistency across months or different periods can be a strong indicator of generalizability. Lastly, be cautious of overfitting — if an alpha looks too perfect in-sample, it may not generalize well. A clean, interpretable IS profile often signals a thoughtful and effective alpha. Thanks for raising this topic — it’s very helpful for all of us!

### 评论 #25 (作者: LR13671, 时间: 1年前)

- **High Returns-to-Drawdown Ratio** : A strong alpha should generate consistent returns relative to the risk it takes. A ratio greater than 2 is often considered a good benchmark, with higher values indicating better performance stability.
- **Sharpe Ratio** : While a Sharpe ratio above 1.75 is considered solid in many regions, top-tier regions like GLB, EUR Top2500, and ASI may require Sharpe ratios above 2.0 or even 2.25 for alphas to stand out. Alphas with stable Sharpe performance across individual years are also preferable.

---

### 评论 #26 (作者: DT49505, 时间: 1年前)

The In-Sample (IS) summary is an essential diagnostic tool for evaluating the potential of an alpha, and several key metrics can signal a strong, deployable candidate. A high Sharpe ratio is a primary indicator, but it must be contextualized—values above 1.75 are generally considered solid, though more competitive regions like GLB or ASI often require >2.0. The returns-to-drawdown ratio is equally critical; strong alphas maintain performance without exposing portfolios to excessive risk. Fitness score is another important metric, as it reflects the alpha's robustness and overfitting resistance. Additionally, turnover should be stable and moderate—extreme turnover may imply fragility. Sector and capitalization diversification, as observed through IS visualizations, further enhance an alpha's viability. Alphas showing strong, consistent Sharpe across sub- and super-universes tend to generalize better. Lastly, consistent year-over-year Sharpe ratios and favorable liquidity-adjusted performance provide confidence in scalability and real-world applicability. Using the IS summary this way helps avoid false positives and ensures long-term portfolio fit.

---

### 评论 #27 (作者: ML46209, 时间: 1年前)

In my opinion, a good alpha from an IS (In-Sample) summary usually has the following key characteristics:

- A high and stable Sharpe ratio across years, ideally above 0.5 annually to demonstrate consistency.
- A good profit-to-drawdown ratio, preferably above 2, and even better if above 5, to show solid risk-adjusted returns.
- A fitness score greater than 1 to ensure the alpha is not overly overfit.
- Turnover at a reasonable level, around 10-20%, to avoid excessive trading costs that can hurt real-world performance.
- Well-diversified capital allocation across sectors, market caps, and geographies, avoiding concentration in illiquid stocks or single sectors.
- Alpha signals that are relatively independent and show low correlation with other alphas, which helps improve overall portfolio efficiency.
- Lastly, avoid IS alphas that look “too perfect” as they are often overfit; prioritize alphas that demonstrate sustainable performance in out-of-sample (OS) testing.

Focusing on these points when evaluating an IS summary increases the chance of selecting strong and realistic alphas that can be effectively used in live trading.

Good alphas reflected in IS (Information Coefficient) summaries typically exhibit several key qualities. First, a consistently positive IS indicates the alpha’s predictive power and alignment with future returns. Stability over time is crucial; fluctuations or sharp drops in IS suggest overfitting or regime dependency. High IR (Information Ratio) alongside IS often signals a strong risk-adjusted return. Additionally, low correlation with other alphas or market factors enhances portfolio diversification benefits. It’s also important that the alpha maintains reasonable turnover and does not rely heavily on noisy signals, as indicated by smoother IC decay patterns. Analyzing IS summary helps identify robust alphas that contribute sustainably to portfolio performance.

### 评论 #29 (作者: SK90981, 时间: 1年前)

Focus on high IS Sharpe, solid margins, and fitness. Prioritize diverse datasets and avoid overfitting to thresholds. Sharpe > margin > return > fitness.

---

### 评论 #30 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 1年前)

When reviewing an alpha’s IS (In-Sample) summary, I focus on a few key metrics that consistently correlate with performance and reliability. First, a  **Sharpe ratio ≥ 2**  (USA) or ≥1.8 (other regions) is generally a minimum threshold, but equally important is  **Sharpe stability across years**  — I like to see each year > 0.5 to ensure consistency.  **Fitness score ≥ 1.0**  indicates robust signal design, and a  **return/drawdown ratio > 2**  is a solid benchmark for reward-to-risk balance. I also check the  **Visualizations**  tab to ensure weight isn't overly concentrated in a single sector or market cap group. Capital should ideally be allocated across diverse, liquid stocks. Lastly,  **turnover between 10–20%**  is optimal — too high and it risks poor tradability, too low and it may underreact. A well-rounded alpha balances return, risk, and scalability.
