The operator  `group_mean(datafield, weight, group)`  replaces all elements in a group with the weighted mean of the chosen datafield.

One useful application is calculating the  **harmonic mean**  of ratios. Harmonic means are often better than arithmetic means for ratios like P/E or P/B because they reduce the impact of extreme values.

**Examples:**

- **Industry P/E ratio**  (harmonic mean):

`1 / (group_mean(eps / close, 1, industry))
`

- **Industry P/B ratio**  (harmonic mean):

`1 / (group_mean(bookvalue_ps / close, 1, industry))
`

This approach is handy when we want more robust group-level averages across industries, sectors, or regions.

Great explanation! Using the harmonic mean for ratios like P/E and P/B definitely provides a more robust measure, especially in the presence of outliers. The use of  `group_mean`  in this way is clever — avoids the pitfalls of directly averaging the raw ratios.

great explanation for any robust performing alpha to leverage over average ones

Great use case — harmonic mean really makes sense for ratios like P/E and P/B since it dampens outliers better than arithmetic mean.

Thank you for sharing this practical use case. I’ve often struggled with how to treat ratios at the group level because the arithmetic mean sometimes gives misleading results when there are outliers. Your example with harmonic means makes the solution really clear and actionable. I especially appreciate that you showed concrete formulas with EPS/close and bookvalue_ps/close—it makes the concept much easier to grasp and apply. Posts like this help bridge theory with hands-on practice, and I find that incredibly valuable when thinking about more robust alpha design. I’ll definitely experiment with this approach in my own workflows and see how it compares with the traditional arithmetic averaging I’ve been using.

The  **`group_mean`  operator**  can be used to compute harmonic means of ratios like P/E or P/B by averaging the inverse form, which reduces the influence of outliers. This provides more robust and representative group-level metrics across industries or sectors.

That’s a really solid use of group_mean. Harmonic averages give a much fairer picture for ratios since a few extreme outliers won’t distort the whole industry view. I’ve found it especially useful with valuation metrics like P/E or P/B where single companies can have crazy numbers. It keeps the group-level signal more stable and realistic for comparisons.

The group_mean operator can be applied to ratios such as P/E or P/B by averaging their inverse values, effectively computing a harmonic mean. This approach reduces the impact of outliers and yields more stable, representative metrics at the industry or sector level.

Exactly! Applying the harmonic mean to ratios like P/E and P/B makes the metric more resilient to outliers. Using  `group_mean`  here is a smart approach, as it prevents distortion from extreme values that can occur when simply averaging raw ratios.

This is a really interesting angle I usually think of  `group_mean`  in the context of smoothing or filling values, but using it to construct harmonic means for ratios like P/E and P/B is a clever twist. It’s a good reminder that sometimes the most powerful applications come from combining simple operators in non-obvious ways. Definitely gave me a new perspective on how to approach group-level metrics.

This is a fantastic illustration of how flexible  `group_mean()`  can be beyond its standard role in smoothing or filling values. The harmonic mean approach for ratios like P/E and P/B is particularly important, since arithmetic means often give distorted results when extreme values are present (e.g., companies with negative or near-zero earnings leading to outsized P/E ratios). By working with the inverse form and then applying  `group_mean()` , you effectively reduce the weight of these outliers and produce a much more stable, representative group-level metric. I’ve seen this approach especially useful when normalizing valuation metrics across industries for relative comparisons—it keeps the measure both economically intuitive and mathematically robust. Another interesting extension might be to test harmonic means on leverage or payout ratios, which also tend to have fat-tailed distributions. The beauty here is how a single operator like  `group_mean()`  can be repurposed into a higher-level statistical technique just by rethinking the input structure.

That’s a great example of using group\_mean effectively. Applying harmonic averages helps prevent extreme outliers from skewing industry-level ratios, making the signals more reliable. I’ve found this particularly valuable for valuation metrics like P/E or P/B, where a few extreme companies can distort the picture. It keeps the group-level signal stable and realistic for meaningful cross-stock comparisons.

This is a very practical and insightful demonstration of how  `group_mean()`  can be repurposed for more advanced statistical uses like computing harmonic means. Ratios such as P/E and P/B are notorious for being heavily influenced by outliers—especially when earnings are close to zero, which can create extremely large or even nonsensical values. By inverting the ratio, applying  `group_mean()` , and then taking the reciprocal, you effectively dampen these distortions and end up with a group-level metric that better represents the central tendency. This approach not only improves robustness but also makes cross-industry or cross-sector comparisons more meaningful. Another extension I’d recommend exploring is applying this harmonic mean approach to other fat-tailed metrics such as leverage ratios, payout ratios, or cash flow multiples, where extreme values tend to dominate the arithmetic average. Combining harmonic averaging with stabilizers like  `winsorize()`  could further enhance resilience without losing too much informational content. It’s a great reminder that simple operators, when combined thoughtfully, can replicate higher-level statistical techniques and bring substantial improvements to signal design.

Thank you for sharing such a clear and practical use case of  `group_mean()` —the examples with P/E and P/B really make the application of harmonic means easy to understand and directly usable. I especially appreciate that you provided the explicit formulas with EPS/close and bookvalue_ps/close, because it bridges the gap between theory and practice. Often when working with valuation ratios, I’ve struggled with how to treat extreme outliers that skew arithmetic averages, and this solution provides a robust, elegant fix. The follow-up comments also added depth, showing that this idea can be extended beyond valuation into other ratio-based metrics where outliers are common. Posts like this are a big reason why the community is so valuable—turning abstract concepts into actionable tricks that can strengthen alpha design. Thanks again for breaking it down so clearly and inspiring me to rethink how I approach group-level metrics!

Using group_mean to build harmonic averages for ratios like P/E or P/B is clever. It shows that combining simple operators creatively can yield powerful insights, offering a fresh perspective on constructing group-level metrics.
