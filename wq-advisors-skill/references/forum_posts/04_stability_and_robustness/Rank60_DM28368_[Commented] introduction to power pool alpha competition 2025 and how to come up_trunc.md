To design an alpha for the  **Power Pool Alphas Competition 2025** , you should focus on creating a predictive signal that captures market inefficiencies using the datasets and operators available on WorldQuant BRAIN. Since you're working with  **Others, Analysts, and Fundamental datasets** , here’s a structured approach to coming up with a solid alpha:

### **1. Define Your Hypothesis**

Your alpha should be based on a logical, market-driven idea. Here are some possible approaches:

- **Energy Market Link** : If "Power Pool" refers to electricity markets, you can explore how energy-related companies perform based on power demand/supply metrics.
- **Analyst Sentiment** : If the competition relates to stock trading, you can build an alpha using  **analyst ratings, earnings surprises, or price-to-earnings trends** .
- **Fundamental Strength** : Construct an alpha using fundamental indicators like  **ROE, debt ratios, or revenue growth**  to predict stock movements.

### **2. Data Exploration & Feature Engineering**

Using the available datasets, try constructing relevant factors:

#### **A. Analyst Data-Based Features**

- **Consensus Change Factor** : Stocks with upward revisions from analysts tend to outperform.
  Factor=log(Avg(AnalystRating)t−Avg(AnalystRating)t−5std(AnalystRating)t−5)\text{Factor} = \text{log} \left( \frac{\text{Avg(AnalystRating)}_{t} - \text{Avg(AnalystRating)}_{t-5}}{\text{std(AnalystRating)}_{t-5}} \right)Factor=log(std(AnalystRating)t−5​Avg(AnalystRating)t​−Avg(AnalystRating)t−5​​)
- **Earnings Surprise Effect** :
  Factor=EPS Actual−EPS EstimateStock Price\text{Factor} = \frac{\text{EPS Actual} - \text{EPS Estimate}}{\text{Stock Price}}Factor=Stock PriceEPS Actual−EPS Estimate​

#### **B. Fundamental Data-Based Features**

- **Profitability & Growth Factor** :
  Factor=ROE×Revenue Growth\text{Factor} = \text{ROE} \times \text{Revenue Growth}Factor=ROE×Revenue Growth
- **Debt-to-Equity Influence**  (inverse to favor lower-debt companies):
  Factor=1Debt/Equity Ratio\text{Factor} = \frac{1}{\text{Debt/Equity Ratio}}Factor=Debt/Equity Ratio1​

#### **C. Others Data-Based Features (If Power Pool Relates to Energy)**

- **Energy Consumption vs. Stock Performance**
  - If energy demand spikes, utility and power-related stocks might rise.
  - You could  **normalize energy usage data**  and compare it to stock returns.

### **3. Normalize and Densify Factors**

To ensure your factor works properly in BRAIN, apply  `densify()`  to avoid missing values and ensure consistency:

Factor=densify(your factor calculation)\text{Factor} = \text{densify}(\text{your factor calculation})Factor=densify(your factor calculation)

### **4. Combine with Statistical Operators**

You can refine your alpha by applying:

- **Inverse (1/x)**  to adjust impact
- **Min/Max**  to limit extreme values
- **Power (x^n)**  to control sensitivity

### **5. Backtest and Optimize**

- Test your alpha using a  **backtesting framework**  in BRAIN.
- Optimize parameters (e.g., lookback periods).
- Combine with other factors to reduce noise.

### **Final Thoughts**

Your alpha should be  **market-driven, unique, and robust**  against different conditions

It seems like the proposed data-based features focus on leveraging key financial and analyst-driven indicators to assess stock performance. Analyst consensus change, particularly upward revisions, offers insight into potential stock outperformance. The earnings surprise factor measures the impact of actual earnings exceeding estimates on stock price, signaling market reactions to performance discrepancies. In fundamental analysis, profitability and growth, represented by ROE and revenue growth, serve as crucial performance indicators, while the debt-to-equity ratio is inversely influential—favoring companies with lower debt levels. Additionally, energy consumption patterns may provide predictive power for utility stocks, especially during demand surges. These features may enhance investment strategies.

Thanks for  [顾问 DM28368 (Rank 60)](/hc/en-us/profiles/21564148937495-顾问 DM28368 (Rank 60))  's suggestion! Using the  **other128**  dataset across all regions could definitely open up more diverse insights. The broader regional coverage might help capture unique market dynamics that aren’t always visible in more focused datasets. This could lead to better cross-market correlations or reveal signals that are region-specific but also globally impactful. I'll definitely consider integrating this dataset into my alpha exploration for a more holistic approach. Have you seen any particular features or signals in  **other128**  that stand out for predicting market moves?

This is a solid and well-structured framework for approaching alpha generation in the Power Pool Alpha Competition 2025. One technical aspect worth emphasizing is the importance of time horizon alignment between features and prediction targets. For instance, when using EPS surprises or analyst rating changes, make sure that your factor construction respects the lag in information dissemination to avoid lookahead bias. Additionally, combining features from multiple datasets—like blending analyst sentiment with fundamental strength—could help reduce noise and improve the alpha’s Sharpe ratio. Another interesting extension would be to use rolling z-scores to standardize features over time before densifying, which can stabilize volatility and make your signals more robust across market regimes. Also, consider including interaction terms or conditional factors (e.g., sentiment alpha that only activates under certain volatility conditions) to capture non-linearities in the market.

Thank you so much for this comprehensive and clearly articulated breakdown of how to design alphas for the Power Pool Alpha Competition 2025. As someone still growing in this space, I found it incredibly helpful how you categorized the factor sources (Analyst, Fundamental, Others) and walked through each with real-world examples and formulas. It really bridges the gap between theoretical alpha design and practical application using BRAIN tools. Your explanation of normalization, densification, and the use of statistical operators provides valuable insight that will surely help many participants like myself. I also appreciate the reminder to backtest and refine based on data behavior—it's a great way to build not just one-off ideas, but scalable, durable alphas. Looking forward to experimenting with some of the ideas you mentioned!

This thread has been incredibly rich—appreciate all the diverse perspectives! One thing I’ve been exploring in the Power Pool Alpha Competition 2025 is how regime shifts (like changes in macroeconomic policy or commodity price volatility) affect the reliability of fundamental factors over time. For example, the predictive power of ROE × Revenue Growth seems to vary significantly depending on interest rate regimes. I’ve started incorporating a rolling macro-adjusted filter to condition my alpha signals—basically, it tempers factor weightings based on trailing correlations with key macro indicators. Has anyone else experimented with dynamic weighting or regime detection in their alpha design? Would love to exchange thoughts on that.

To gain a competitive edge in the Power Pool Alpha Competition 2025, I’ve been exploring  **hybrid alphas**  that combine analyst sentiment momentum with fundamental trend stability. One practical approach is to use  `ts_delta(AnalystRating, 5)`  for short-term sentiment changes and multiply it by a smoothed profitability measure like  `decay_linear(ROE, 10)` . This type of interaction captures both analyst optimism and operational strength. Additionally, I’ve found value in exploring  `other128`  across less-crowded regions—particularly in EMEA and LATAM. To avoid overfitting, I normalize each factor with  `ts_zscore()`  before applying  `densify()` , then backtest with rolling IS/OS slices to ensure durability. Would love to hear if anyone’s experimented with macro overlays or volatility-regime gating on top of these models.
