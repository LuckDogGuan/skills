**Abstract**

Data show that 72% of the earnings announcement premium is realized before, rather than after, earnings releases. We propose that uncertainty resolution before the announcement leads to the large pre-announcement returns, and test the uncertainty resolution hypothesis in the cross section. There is compelling empirical evidence to support the hypothesis: an interquartile increase in firm uncertainty is associated with 4.3% more uncertainty resolution and 0.65% higher market-adjusted returns in the 10-day period before earnings announcements. We also provide evidence that there are two distinct channels for uncertainty resolution: information acquisition by investors and information supply by analysts.

Hi,

Thank you for the interesting paper.

Can we look at this in the following ways?

1. The paper is centered around an important type of event: earnings announcement ( [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings-announcement.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings-announcement.asp) ). They contains the financial information of companies over a period to provide investors and the public the financial performance of the companies. This type of events tend to influence the stock markets returns. If the company is producing good financial returns, it may provide investors with positive outlook and may lead to an increase in stocks prices, and vice versa.

2. Around these events, from the first sentence of the abstract, the authors wrote: Data show that 72% of the earnings announcement premium is realized before, rather than after, earnings releases. 
It shall suggest that the investors already have a good perception of the company performances, results in the stocks prices results, even before the earnings announcement events, with 72% of them realized, as data suggests.

From this interesting phenomenon, the authors may wish to find which predictive market signals the investors may look at before the earnings announcements so that investors could make a quite good predictive investment decisions, (with 72% of the premium realized before the events).

To measure this signal, the author propose an index named uncertainty resolution (as written in sentence 2 of the abstract: We propose that uncertainty resolution before the announcement leads to the large pre-announcement returns, and test the uncertainty resolution hypothesis in the cross section)

3. To measure this uncertainty resolution, in Page 29, the authors wrote: Using options-implied volatilities as our uncertainty measures,.... 
It shall suggest that we could measure this uncertainty resolution signal by options implied volatilities (Using option-related datasets).

4. What should we do next in order to realize this paper into quality Alpha formulas?

Thank you.

Great work!

我阅读的文章是关于  **Earnings** 的：Uncertainty Resolution Before Earnings Announcements

该文章探讨了在财务报告发布前，市场对于公司业绩不确定性的解决如何影响股价。文章的核心观点是，大部分（72%）的财务报告溢价在报告发布前就已经实现，而不是发布后。这表明投资者在报告发布前已经对公司的业绩有了较为准确的预期，从而导致了股价的变动。

文章提出，不确定性的解决是导致财务报告前股价大幅上涨的主要原因，并在横截面上测试了这一假设。研究提供了有力的实证证据支持这一假设：公司不确定性的一个四分位数增加与财务报告前10天内4.3%更多的不确定性解决和0.65%更高的市场调整回报相关联。文章还提供了两个不确定性解决的不同渠道：投资者的信息获取和分析师的信息供应。

具体步骤如下：

1. 我们首先识别财务报告发布前的市场信号，这些信号可能包括市场对公司业绩的预期。
2. 接着，我们使用期权隐含波动率作为不确定性的度量，这是文章在第29页提到的，通过期权相关数据集来衡量不确定性解决信号。
3. 然后，我们分析这些信号如何影响财务报告前的股价表现，特别是通过比较不同公司在报告发布前的股价变动。
4. 最后，我们可以通过构建模型来预测这些信号对股价的影响，从而为投资者提供投资决策的依据。

Alpha Idea：基于文章提出的不确定性解决理论，我们可以开发一个Alpha策略，该策略利用期权隐含波动率来预测财务报告前的股价变动。在财务报告发布前，如果期权隐含波动率显示出较高的不确定性解决，我们可以预期股价会有较大的正向变动，并据此进行投资。此外，我们还可以结合分析师的信息供应和投资者的信息获取来进一步优化我们的预测模型，以提高Alpha策略的准确性和可靠性。

1. **收益公告溢价（Earnings Announcement Premium）**：
   - 数据显示72%的收益公告溢价在公告之前实现，而不是之后。
   - 公式模板：Earnings Announcement Premium=Pre-Announcement Returns+Post-Announcement Returns
   - 其中，Pre-Announcement Returns 可以进一步分解为与不确定性解决相关的回报。

2. **不确定性解决（Uncertainty Resolution）**：
   - 提出不确定性解决假设，并在横截面上测试这一假设。
   - 公式模板：Uncertainty Resolution=Options-Implied Volatilities
   - 其中，期权隐含波动率被用作不确定性的度量。

3. **市场调整回报（Market-Adjusted Returns）**：
   - 在收益公告前10天期间，公司不确定性的四分位数增加与4.3%更多的不确定性解决和0.65%更高的市场调整回报相关联。
   - 公式模板：Market-Adjusted Returns=Actual Returns−Expected Returns
   - 其中，Expected Returns 可以通过市场模型或其他基准模型来估计。

4. **信息获取和信息供应渠道**：
   - 存在两个不同的不确定性解决渠道：投资者的信息获取和分析师的信息供应。
   - 这可能涉及到构建模型来分析投资者情绪和分析师预测。

5. **数据字段和数据集**：
   - 文章提到了几个数据字段，如Earnings announcement（收益公告）、Company Fundamental Data for Equity（公司股权基本面数据）、Price Volume Data for Equity（股权价格和交易量数据）等。
   - 这些数据可以用于构建Alpha公式，例如，通过分析公司的基本面数据和市场交易数据来预测股票的未来表现。

6. **Alpha公式构建**：
   - 基于上述信息，我们可以构建一个Alpha公式，该公式结合了不确定性解决和市场调整回报。
   - 公式模板：Alpha=α×Uncertainty Resolution+β×Market-Adjusted Returns+γ×Other Factors
   - 其中，α、β 和 γ 是模型参数，需要通过历史数据进行估计。

This study, "Uncertainty Resolution Before Earnings Announcements" explores a compelling area in financial economics. The idea of how uncertainty evolves and resolves around the period leading up to earnings announcements is intriguing. I have a few questions and observations regarding the paper:

1. **Key Findings:**  Could you elaborate on the main mechanisms identified in the study that drive uncertainty resolution? Does the paper address whether certain types of firms (e.g., larger vs. smaller firms or those in specific sectors) exhibit stronger patterns of uncertainty resolution?
2. **Methodology:**  What specific measures or proxies for uncertainty were utilized in this study? How do these compare to alternative measures like implied volatility or earnings forecast dispersion?
3. **Market Participants:**  Does the study distinguish between the behaviors of different market participants, such as institutional vs. retail investors, in the lead-up to earnings announcements?
4. **Implications:**  How do the findings of this study affect current models of market efficiency or the valuation of earnings surprises?
5. **Generalizability:**  Are there any discussions in the paper about how these findings might vary across different markets (e.g., developed vs. emerging markets) or under different regulatory regimes?

These aspects are particularly interesting, and further clarification would help deepen the understanding of the results and their broader implications. Looking forward to engaging more on this topic!

Hey  [TN67143](/hc/en-us/profiles/14032371578903-TN67143) , great analysis there! To turn this into quality Alpha formulas, first, we could build a factor based on the options implied volatilities to quantify the uncertainty resolution. Maybe rank the stocks by this measure. Then, see how it correlates with market-adjusted returns in the 10-day period before earnings announcements as the paper mentioned. Also, consider combining it with other relevant factors like fundamental ones to enhance the predictive power. Do some backtesting to refine and validate the formula. That's how we might start.

### 评论 #7 (作者: LN78195, 时间: 1年前)

Leveraging option-implied volatilities as proxies for uncertainty, the study highlights how investors' information acquisition and analysts' supply contribute to pre-announcement returns. For alpha development, focusing on implied volatility trends and integrating event-driven signals could provide actionable strategies. What specific methods or datasets have you found most effective in modeling such pre-event dynamics?

### 评论 #8 (作者: SJ17125, 时间: 1年前)

Hey TN67143, great analysis! To turn this into quality Alpha formulas, we could start by building a factor based on options implied volatilities to quantify uncertainty resolution, then rank the stocks by this measure. Next, we should examine how this factor correlates with market-adjusted returns in the 10-day period leading up to earnings announcements, as mentioned in the paper. Combining this with other relevant factors, like fundamentals, could strengthen the predictive power. Finally, backtest the formula to refine and validate it. That would be a solid starting point.

---

### 评论 #9 (作者: BA51127, 时间: 1年前)

To create quality Alpha formulas from this research, consider using options-implied volatilities to measure uncertainty, then correlate this with market-adjusted returns in the days leading up to announcements. Ranking stocks based on this measure and combining it with other fundamental factors can enhance your strategy. Finally, backtest your approach to ensure it performs well historically. This way, you can effectively leverage the findings from the paper in your trading strategies.

### 评论 #10 (作者: XD81759, 时间: 1年前)

Hey! This research paper highlights an interesting point that most of the earnings announcement premium occurs before the actual announcements due to uncertainty resolution. From a quant perspective, we could potentially build a factor based on firm uncertainty levels. For example, using data like from Ravenpack News Data or Company Fundamental Data for Equity. Monitor the changes in uncertainty and how they relate to market-adjusted returns before earnings announcements. Maybe even combine it with price and volume data to form a multi-factor model for better prediction. It's definitely worth exploring further.

The phenomenon of pre-announcement returns in financial markets has garnered significant attention, particularly concerning the resolution of uncertainty before earnings announcements.

---

### 评论 #13 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

Empirical data indicates that a substantial portion of the earnings announcement premium, approximately 72%, is realized prior to the actual earnings release. This suggests that investors anticipate information and adjust their positions accordingly, leading to notable pre-announcement returns.

---

### 评论 #14 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

The uncertainty resolution hypothesis posits that the mitigation of uncertainty before earnings announcements contributes to significant pre-announcement returns. As investors gather information and form expectations, the diminishing uncertainty leads to price adjustments reflecting anticipated earnings outcomes.

---

### 评论 #15 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

Firms exhibiting higher levels of uncertainty tend to experience more pronounced pre-announcement returns. An interquartile increase in firm uncertainty correlates with a 4.3% greater resolution of uncertainty and a 0.65% increase in market-adjusted returns during the ten-day period preceding earnings announcements.

---

### 评论 #16 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

One channel through which uncertainty is resolved involves proactive information gathering by investors. In anticipation of earnings announcements, investors may analyze market signals, consult industry reports, and scrutinize company disclosures to refine their earnings forecasts, thereby reducing uncertainty.

---

### 评论 #17 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

Another channel pertains to the dissemination of information by financial analysts. Analysts' forecasts and reports provide valuable insights that help clarify a firm's financial prospects, aiding in the resolution of uncertainty before official earnings releases.

---

### 评论 #18 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

The period leading up to earnings announcements often witnesses increased trading activity and price volatility. As uncertainty diminishes through information acquisition and dissemination, market participants adjust their positions, resulting in observable pre-announcement returns.

---

### 评论 #19 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

Implied volatility, derived from options pricing, serves as a proxy for market-expected uncertainty. Studies have shown that implied volatility tends to rise before earnings announcements, reflecting anticipated uncertainty, and subsequently declines as the announcement date approaches and uncertainty resolves.

---

### 评论 #20 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

The concept of event-specific uncertainty highlights that anticipated events, such as earnings announcements, inherently carry uncertainty that impacts investor behavior. The resolution of this uncertainty prior to the event can lead to significant market movements, as investors adjust their expectations and positions accordingly.

---

### 评论 #21 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

Understanding the dynamics of uncertainty resolution before earnings announcements can inform trading strategies. Traders may seek to capitalize on anticipated pre-announcement returns by analyzing indicators of uncertainty and timing their trades to benefit from the expected resolution of uncertainty.

---

### 评论 #22 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

The phenomenon of pre-announcement returns underscores the importance of information flow in financial markets. Efficient dissemination and assimilation of information contribute to price discovery, and the resolution of uncertainty before earnings announcements plays a crucial role in this process, affecting overall market efficiency.

---

### 评论 #23 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

In summary, the resolution of uncertainty before earnings announcements significantly influences pre-announcement returns. Both investor-driven information acquisition and analyst-driven information dissemination are pivotal in this process, with implications for trading strategies and market efficiency.

### 评论 #24 (作者: 顾问 CC40930 (Rank 95), 时间: 1年前)

This study highlights a significant pre-announcement earnings premium, driven by uncertainty resolution before earnings releases. The evidence suggests that higher firm uncertainty leads to greater resolution and higher returns in the period leading up to earnings announcements. The identification of two distinct channels—investor information acquisition and analyst information supply—adds an interesting layer to understanding market reactions. This insight could be crucial for refining trading strategies around earnings announcements and improving the accuracy of forecasts.

### 评论 #26 (作者: 顾问 HD25387 (Rank 65), 时间: 1年前)

The findings about the distinct channels of uncertainty resolution—information acquisition by investors and supply by analysts—are fascinating. Using datasets like  `fnd6_optgr`  to capture option activity during the pre-announcement period could offer additional insights into market expectations and potential predictive signals.

---

### 评论 #27 (作者: 顾问 HD25387 (Rank 65), 时间: 1年前)

The cross-sectional evidence linking firm uncertainty to higher pre-announcement returns adds a quantitative edge to the hypothesis. Has anyone experimented with combining  `returns`  and uncertainty-related metrics to build short-term strategies around earnings announcements? Would love to hear about any practical applications!

### 评论 #28 (作者: VP21767, 时间: 1年前)

This study finds that 72% of the earnings announcement premium occurs before the announcement itself. It supports the uncertainty resolution hypothesis, where resolving firm uncertainty pre-announcement leads to larger returns. An interquartile increase in uncertainty resolution is associated with 4.3% higher uncertainty resolution and 0.65% greater market-adjusted returns in the 10-day pre-announcement period. The research identifies two channels driving this phenomenon: information acquisition by investors and analysts' information supply.

### 评论 #29 (作者: 顾问 HD25387 (Rank 65), 时间: 1年前)

The observation that 72% of the earnings announcement premium is realized before the actual earnings release is fascinating. It highlights the importance of pre-announcement activity. Has anyone explored specific indicators within  `rp_nip_earnings`  that can help capture these early returns effectively?

---

### 评论 #30 (作者: 顾问 HD25387 (Rank 65), 时间: 1年前)

The concept of uncertainty resolution influencing pre-announcement returns aligns well with investor behavior. Utilizing  `fnd6_optgr`  to analyze options data could provide additional insights into sentiment shifts during this period. Has anyone combined this with other datasets for a more robust signal?

---

### 评论 #31 (作者: 顾问 HD25387 (Rank 65), 时间: 1年前)

The study's finding of distinct channels—investor information acquisition and analyst supply—opens opportunities for event-driven alphas. Incorporating  `returns`  data for short-term momentum during this period could be a promising strategy. Any success stories on this approach?

---

### 评论 #32 (作者: 顾问 HD25387 (Rank 65), 时间: 1年前)

Given the significant role of uncertainty resolution in pre-earnings movements, how effective is it to backtest strategies using  `rp_nip_earnings`  across different sectors? Are there specific industries where this effect is more pronounced?

### 评论 #33 (作者: SV11672, 时间: 1年前)

"Fascinating study! The finding that 72% of the earnings announcement premium is realized before the earnings release is striking. The uncertainty resolution hypothesis provides a compelling explanation for this phenomenon, and the empirical evidence supporting it is impressive. The identification of two distinct channels for uncertainty resolution - information acquisition by investors and information supply by analysts - adds depth to the analysis. This research has important implications for our understanding of the role of uncertainty in financial markets and the mechanisms by which investors and analysts resolve uncertainty."

---

### 评论 #34 (作者: SV11672, 时间: 1年前)

"The study's focus on the pre-announcement period is a refreshing change from the typical emphasis on post-announcement returns. The evidence that firm uncertainty is a key driver of pre-announcement returns is convincing, and the quantification of the relationship between uncertainty resolution and returns is particularly useful. The distinction between information acquisition by investors and information supply by analysts is also a valuable contribution to the literature, highlighting the complex interplay between different market participants in resolving uncertainty."

### 评论 #35 (作者: AK98027, 时间: 1年前)

This Research reveals a substantial pre-earnings announcement premium, particularly pronounced in firms with high uncertainty. This premium is driven by two key mechanisms: investor information gathering and analyst research output. Higher firm uncertainty correlates with greater uncertainty resolution and stronger pre-announcement returns. These findings have practical implications for earnings-based trading strategies and forecast modeling.

---

### 评论 #36 (作者: AK98027, 时间: 1年前)

Most of the stock price increase happens  *before*  the earnings news is released, suggesting the market values reduced uncertainty. This pre-announcement boost is linked to investor research and analyst insights.

This version focuses on the core findings:

- **Early price increase:**  Emphasizes the timing of the stock price movement.
- **Reduced uncertainty:**  Highlights the key driver of the price change.
- **Key factors:**  Briefly mentions investor research and analyst contributions.

這篇論文探討了在收益公告前的不確定性解決如何影響股價，72%的收益公告溢價竟然在公告前就已實現，這對我們做量化交易的人來說是個有趣的觀點！我覺得利用選擇權隱含波動率來量化不確定性，然後觀察其與市場調整回報的關係，可以是一個不錯的策略。特別是如果可以結合基本面數據來進行多因子模型的建構，會更加強化預測的準確性。期待和大家一起探討如何將這些概念轉化為實際的交易策略！

The concept of  **event-specific uncertainty**  underscores the idea that major events—such as earnings announcements, product launches, or geopolitical developments—introduce a level of uncertainty into the market. Investors are often uncertain about the outcome of these events and how they will impact the underlying assets.

Here’s how event-specific uncertainty influences the market:

### 1.  **Pre-Event Uncertainty** :

- Leading up to an event, there is often ambiguity surrounding the potential outcome. Investors may have varying expectations, which results in mixed positions or limited trading activity, as they try to gauge the potential market reaction.

### 2.  **Market Movements Post-Resolution** :

- As the event unfolds or when additional information becomes available, this uncertainty is resolved. Investors, now armed with clearer expectations or outcomes, adjust their positions. This adjustment can lead to  **significant price movements**  as the market collectively re-prices assets based on the new information.

### 3.  **Investor Behavior** :

- The uncertainty surrounding an event creates a  **decision-making challenge**  for investors. Some may hedge their bets, while others take more speculative positions. As the event nears, investors may begin to position themselves for the anticipated post-event movement, creating volatility and trading opportunities.

### 4.  **Event-Driven Trading** :

- Investors and traders often capitalize on this uncertainty by developing strategies around the anticipated resolution of the event.  **Event-driven strategies**  aim to exploit price movements that arise from these periods of heightened uncertainty and subsequent clarification, leading to potentially profitable trading opportunities.

Understanding event-specific uncertainty is critical for designing trading strategies around major events, as it helps predict the magnitude and timing of market movements once the uncertainty is resolved. It also allows traders to anticipate potential volatility and adjust their positions in anticipation of market reactions.
