Many contributors in the IND region struggle with low Robust Sharpe, which makes it hard for Alphas to pass stability checks. I recently tried a simple idea that worked well: using lower decay values while simulating alpha . Lower DECAY helped reduce noise, made the signals smoother, and improved their stability over different periods. One of my new Alphas even passed the robustness tests after this change. It’s still early, but this approach looks promising. If anyone else has used lower DECAY or similar methods to improve Robust Sharpe, I’d be happy to hear your experience.

I was not able to reduce turnover so i tried this method and this worked well for my alpha

Lowering the DECAY parameter is indeed a useful approach in the IND region, since it smooths the signal, reduces short-term noise, and often leads to a more stable Robust Sharpe across regimes. In markets with higher volatility or less consistent microstructure, shorter-memory signals can fluctuate too much, so adding decay smoothing helps the alpha behave more predictably. Others may also find improvements by combining low-decay features with turnover control or clipping extreme values to stabilize performance further.

I agree, lowering decay tends to help in IND. It reduces sensitivity to short-lived moves and makes performance more consistent across subperiods.

so whats your range for lower decay? kindly.

I was not able to reduce prod correlation..

Nice observation! Is the Lower decay the same as the ts_decay_linear() calculation?

I've also observed this, either using lower decay or by simply reducing the days helps.

Using a lower decay often improves results. It reduces sensitivity to short-term fluctuations and leads to more consistent performance across subperiods.

I’ve seen similar improvements in IND. In practice, I usually test decay values in a relatively low range (e.g., short to mid windows) and compare robustness rather than peak Sharpe. Lower decay helps smooth microstructure noise, but it still needs to be balanced with turnover and prod correlation to avoid over-smoothing the signal.

I’ve seen similar issues in IND as well. Shorter decay often seems to fit the market dynamics better and avoids overreacting to noise. Curious if you also tried combining lower decay with sector or liquidity neutralization to further stabilize Robust Sharpe.

This is a useful observation, and it highlights how  **Robust Sharpe in IND**  is often less about finding new datasets and more about  *matching signal horizon to market microstructure* . On  **WorldQuant Brain** , IND alphas frequently fail robustness because they react too aggressively to short-lived fluctuations in a relatively smaller and noisier universe. Lowering decay effectively lengthens the signal’s memory, which suppresses day-to-day churn and reduces sensitivity to transient spikes that tend to break stability checks.

What’s important, though, is  *why*  lower decay helps. In many IND datasets—especially those tied to liquidity, sentiment, or short-term price behavior—noise dominates at short horizons. High decay unintentionally converts that noise into trading decisions, inflating variance and hurting Robust Sharpe even if IS metrics look acceptable. Lower decay shifts the signal toward capturing persistent effects rather than microstructure artifacts. That said, I’d still recommend scanning a  **range**  of lower decays and checking IC consistency and turnover response, rather than locking into a single value. When Robust Sharpe improves smoothly across that band, it’s a strong indication the underlying signal is genuinely better aligned with the region’s structure.

Thank you for sharing this experience—posts like this are especially valuable because they come from practical iteration rather than theory. Many people in the IND region struggle with Robust Sharpe and assume the problem lies in datasets or neutralization choices, when in reality it’s often a horizon mismatch. Your example shows that relatively small configuration changes can meaningfully improve stability when they’re grounded in how the market actually behaves.

I also appreciate that you framed this as an early but promising result instead of a universal rule. That invites experimentation rather than blind copying, which is exactly the right attitude. Hearing concrete adjustments that worked for others helps reduce frustration and encourages more disciplined testing. Thanks again for contributing this insight—it’s a helpful reminder that robustness often improves through restraint and smoothing, not added complexity.

Lowering the decay can help by smoothing out short-term noise, resulting in more stable and consistent performance across different periods.

I’ve noticed comparable improvements in IND as well. In practice, I tend to experiment with shorter to mid-range decay settings and focus on robustness rather than chasing maximum Sharpe. Using lower decay values helps dampen microstructure noise, but it still needs to be carefully balanced against turnover and production correlation to avoid flattening the signal too much.
