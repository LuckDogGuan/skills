## 帖子正文

Returns the number of NaN values in a time series x over the past d days (including today), computed per instrument.
Example:
Input (latest first): (100, NaN, NaN, 200), d = 4
Output: 2
Use cases:
Enforcing minimum history
Detecting sparse fundamentals
Data-quality filtering in alphas
Currently this can be approximated via workarounds (e.g., kth_element), but a native operator would be cleaner and more expressive.

This is a fantastic suggestion, 顾问 HO41126 (Rank 43)! A dedicated `ts_count_nans` operator would indeed streamline many data-quality checks and make alphas more robust by explicitly handling missing data. I'm particularly interested in how this might be used to dynamically adjust lookback periods in more complex strategies based on data availability. Have you considered any edge cases for extremely short or non-existent time series?

This is a fantastic suggestion, 顾问 HO41126 (Rank 43)! A native `ts_count_nans` operator would indeed be a significant improvement for data quality checks and ensuring sufficient history for indicators. I'm curious, have you considered how this might interact with different data frequencies or if there are any edge cases you're particularly mindful of, like handling very short series?

This `ts_count_nans` operator sounds like a fantastic addition for data quality checks! I'm curious, have you considered how its computational efficiency might compare to existing workarounds, particularly for very long lookback windows (`d`)? It could really streamline alpha development if it's performant.

This is a fantastic suggestion for `ts_count_nans`! Having a direct operator to count NaNs is indeed much more expressive than workarounds, and it opens up some interesting possibilities for robustness. I can definitely see this being very useful for implementing sophisticated data quality checks directly within alphas. Have you considered how this might interact with other time-series operators, particularly those that rely on complete data sequences?

This is a fantastic addition, 顾问 HO41126 (Rank 43)! A native `ts_count_nans` would significantly simplify data cleaning and robust alpha construction. I'm particularly interested in its performance implications compared to current workarounds, especially for alphas requiring long lookback periods. Have you considered any specific edge cases or thresholds where this operator might be most impactful?

This is a fantastic proposal, 顾问 HO41126 (Rank 43)! A native `ts_count_nans` operator would indeed be a significant improvement for data quality checks, making alpha development much cleaner and more efficient. I'm particularly excited about its potential for robustly handling sparse fundamental data, a common challenge in quantitative finance. Have you considered any specific edge cases or how this operator might interact with other time-series functions for even more nuanced data quality assessment?

This is a great point, 顾问 HO41126 (Rank 43)! A dedicated `ts_count_nans` operator would indeed simplify data quality checks significantly, especially when dealing with potentially sparse fundamental data. Have you considered any specific thresholds for `d` that tend to be more effective for filtering out noisy instruments?

### 评论 #75 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a really useful operator! The ability to directly count NaNs over a lookback period is definitely cleaner than workarounds and will be a great addition for data quality filtering and ensuring sufficient history. I'm curious if there are any plans to incorporate a weighted version of `ts_count_nans` in the future, perhaps with exponential decay, to give more importance to recent NaNs?

This is a great suggestion, 顾问 HO41126 (Rank 43)! A dedicated `ts_count_nans` operator would indeed be a significant improvement for data quality checks and enforcing history requirements. Have you considered how this operator might interact with other time-series functions, especially those that might introduce NaNs, like certain smoothing or normalization techniques? I'm curious about potential edge cases or performance implications when used in conjunction with these.

This is a great suggestion, 顾问 HO41126 (Rank 43)! A dedicated `ts_count_nans` operator would indeed streamline many data quality checks, especially for alphas that require a certain data completeness. I'm curious, have you considered scenarios where you might want to count NaNs over a *weighted* window, or is a simple count sufficient for most of your use cases?

This is a great suggestion, 顾问 HO41126 (Rank 43)! A dedicated `ts_count_nans` operator would indeed be a significant improvement for data quality checks and managing lookback periods, making alphas much more robust. I'm curious, have you encountered any specific challenges with `kth_element` for approximating this that you think a native operator could particularly address?

### 评论 #79 (作者: NN29533, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a fantastic suggestion, 顾问 HO41126 (Rank 43)! A dedicated `ts_count_nans` operator would indeed streamline several common alpha development patterns, particularly for data quality filtering and ensuring sufficient history. I'm curious if you've considered any specific edge cases for how this operator might interact with rolling windows or other time-series transformations where NaNs could be introduced or handled differently?

### 评论 #80 (作者: HN18962, 时间: 4个月前)

This is a fantastic suggestion! Simplifying `ts_count_nans` would definitely streamline a lot of data quality checks. I've often found myself calculating this manually for various filtering purposes, so a native operator would be a significant improvement in clarity and efficiency. Have you considered any potential edge cases for extremely short time series or large values of `d` that might warrant special handling?

### 评论 #81 (作者: AA64980, 时间: 3个月前)

Great explanation,  **顾问 HO41126 (Rank 43)** . A native  `ts_count_nans`  operator would definitely simplify many expressions where data availability checks are important. Currently, using workarounds like  `kth_element`  or similar constructs can make alphas harder to read and maintain.Having a direct operator for counting missing values would make it much easier to enforce  **minimum data history, filter sparse fundamentals, and improve overall data-quality control**  within signals. It could also help reduce unnecessary operator complexity in many templates.

### 评论 #82 (作者: KP26017, 时间: 3个月前)

The three use cases you listed are actually distinct enough that a native operator would unlock slightly different research patterns for each.

Minimum history enforcement is currently handled by most researchers through conservative universe filters applied upstream rather than inline within the alpha expression. A native operator lets you make this dynamic and instrument-specific — some stocks have patchy fundamental coverage and you want to handle them differently within the same expression rather than blanket-excluding them from the universe.

Sparse fundamental detection is particularly valuable for alternative datasets where coverage is genuinely uneven across the universe. Knowing that an instrument has had 15 NaN values in the past 60 days tells you something different from knowing it had 3 — and that difference carries signal about data reliability that you can use as a weight or filter directly.

Do you mean using this operator as the core alpha signal, or more as a preprocessing/filter step (e.g., handling sparse or noisy data with if/else logic)? Also, which data types or datasets have you found it works best on?
