With the new India universe now live, I’m planning to start some initial research and alpha testing. Before I dive in, I wanted to ask: which existing region (like USA, CHN, or AMR) do you think is the closest match to India in terms of data behavior, liquidity, or factor response? Also, has anyone found anything interesting or unexpected so far any early signals, pitfalls, or notes to keep in mind while building for IND?

From my experience, IND shares some structural traits with CHN, especially in liquidity distribution.

I think that  the closest match to India in terms of data behavior, is what we noticed by the official lauch account's news-- ASI   region.  Good luck and looking forward to your later trial and research results.

ASI seems to have similar traits with the India market but max trade is optional .

Be aware that IND requires 40% turnover or less. Personally, will recommend optimizing toward 20%.

You can start migrating pass ASI/TWN/KOR/HKG/ Alpha ideas onto IND, these should help.

最接近参考区域：CHN

优先用情绪+宏观+长动量，先不要堆高频和全球因子（基于CHN)

turnover和maxtrade按要求设置、打开（官方文档）

[YW42946](/hc/en-us/profiles/12485882527255-YW42946)   [HY20507](/hc/en-us/profiles/33197888449047-HY20507)  What is the recommended margin level for alphas to submit? 15, 20?

The IND region exhibits characteristics somewhat between ASI and CHN — moderate liquidity dispersion, strong sector concentration, and sensitivity to short-term volatility. Early testing suggests that cross-sectional factors adapted from ASI or TWN can transfer well, provided turnover remains below 40%. It’s also advisable to re-tune delay structures and scaling parameters, as IND’s execution costs and trading frictions differ. Careful validation of signal persistence and region-specific anomalies is crucial for robust alpha design.

The IND region sits somewhere between ASI and CHN in its market profile, showing moderate liquidity dispersion, pronounced sector concentration, and notable sensitivity to short-term volatility. Initial experimentation indicates that cross-sectional factors borrowed from ASI or TWN can translate reasonably well, as long as turnover stays under roughly 40%. It’s also important to recalibrate delay settings and scaling choices, given IND’s distinct execution costs and trading frictions. Thoroughly validating signal persistence and region-specific patterns is key to developing durable alphas.

India behaves most like a mix of China and AMR because it has strong liquidity in the top stocks, noticeable retail-driven swings, and faster shifts in sentiment, but it is generally more stable than China and less smooth than the US. Early observations show that simple momentum and volume ideas work but can decay quickly, crowding builds fast, and turnover needs to be kept under control because costs rise quickly in IND. It also helps to stress test your idea across liquidity buckets because lower-tier stocks behave very differently from the top names.

The IND region has a market profile that lies between ASI and CHN, featuring moderate liquidity dispersion, significant sector concentration, and heightened sensitivity to short-term volatility. Early experimentation shows that cross-sectional factors adapted from ASI or TWN can perform reasonably well, provided turnover is carefully controlled, typically under 40%. However, it’s essential to recalibrate delay settings, scaling choices, and operator parameters to account for IND-specific execution costs and trading frictions. Equally important is validating signal persistence and ensuring that region-specific patterns are captured, rather than relying solely on translated factors. Building alphas that reflect these unique characteristics increases robustness and reduces cross-region correlation. How do you approach adjusting delay and scaling settings to optimize alpha performance in a new regional universe like IND?

The IND region sits between ASI and CHN in terms of market structure, with moderate liquidity dispersion, noticeable sector concentration, and strong sensitivity to short-term volatility. In practice, cross-sectional ideas adapted from ASI or TWN can translate reasonably well, but only if turnover is kept tightly controlled, often below 40%, due to rising execution costs. Simple momentum or volume-based signals may work initially, yet they tend to decay faster as crowding builds. This makes it essential to recalibrate delay settings, scaling methods, and operator parameters to reflect IND-specific trading frictions and cost dynamics. Stress-testing across liquidity buckets is also critical, since lower-liquidity stocks behave very differently from top-tier names. Ultimately, alphas perform best when they are adjusted to capture IND’s unique microstructure rather than relying on direct regional transfers.
