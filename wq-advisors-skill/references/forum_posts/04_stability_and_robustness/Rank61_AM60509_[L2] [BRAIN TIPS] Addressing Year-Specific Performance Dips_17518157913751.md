Encountering fluctuating results while researching Alphas is common. Sometimes, Alphas may show poor performance (dips in PNL) in specific years, which can be confusing. You can improve your Alpha's performance by looking not just at the in-sample (IS) summary section but also the year-by-year results (under the ‘Aggregate Data’). Here are some tips:

**Why do performance dips happen?**

- When Alphas show frequent poor performance, they might pose a greater risk in the future
- A decline in the PnL chart over a few years (image below) can be a warning sign for your Alpha’s robustness and OS performance
- This decline could be due to:
  - Random noise or overfitting
  - The Alpha being used by many quants, making it unviable
  - Major events like the COVID-19 crash in 2020, could also affect Alpha performance if the Alpha is not robust
- If an Alpha performs poorly during the in-sample period, it's generally safer not to utilize it. This is why the IS-ladder test is one of the consultant submission tests.

**How to improve dips in the in-sample period?**

- To address the dip in specific years, consider eliminating risks not associated with your main Alpha idea
- If your Alpha idea is strong, but the Alpha is volatile and less robust during certain periods, try neutralizing these risks. For example, if you want to assign more weight on stocks with high ROE, remember that ROE can differ by industry: internet service companies may have higher ROE than manufacturing companies. Then, a decline in internet service industry might severely impact your Alpha. So, neutralizing these risks can be one of the solutions to remove temporal poor performance.
- Here are some ways to neutralize:
- [Neutralization](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/advanced-topics/neut-cons)  option in the settings
  - Besides Market to Subindustry neutralization, try using Slow factors and Fast factors.
- [Neutralizing operators](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/data-and-operators/operators)
  - Group_neutralize, group_rank or group_zscore operators
  - Vector_neut operator
  - Regression_neut operator
  - Ts_vector_neut operator

**Other types of dips/spikes issues**

If your turnover chart shows short-period spikes, this could be due to using datafields with low coverage. See the example below.

If the low coverage datafields lack some data at certain timestamps, the Alpha using this datafield would change all its positions. This situation may result in a large reduction in coverage for these days, causing the Alpha to fail the concentrated weight test. To tackle this, try filling operators like ts_backfill or group_backfill to lower spiking turnover and prevent low coverage.

Hi, I would like to ask what is the difference between vector_neut and ts_vector_neut, and why ts_vector_neut has a very slow sim speed. As I understand it, they take the projection of the risk factor to neutralize, thereby minimizing drawdown.

I wonder if there is some kind of condition in trade_when that can handle the dips of the last few years?

Fluctuating Alpha performance may stem from overfitting, market events, or data limitations. Address dips by neutralizing risks tied to your idea using operators like  `group_neutralize`  or  `vector_neut` . For low coverage datafields causing turnover spikes, use filling operators like  `ts_backfill` . Analyze year-by-year results for insights and improve robustness.

Hi  [DP11917](/hc/en-us/profiles/18243546243735-DP11917) ! You can try identifying periods with high volatility by using the ts_std_dev operator.

Hi  [TK95999](/hc/en-us/profiles/18243496991767-TK95999) !

For each day, the vector_neut operator will form a vector using the input value of each stock (an instrument vector), and then perform neutralization on that instrument vector. It will output the neutralized instrument vector for each day.

For each day and  *each stock* , the ts_vector_neut will form a vector using the input value of the stock for the past d days (a time series vector), and then perform neutralization on that time series vector. It will output the latest value of the neutralized time series vector for that stock for each day. It repeats this process for every stock in the universe.

As seen from the explanation above, the ts_vector_neut has more processes involved than the vector_neut operator and will take a longer time.

Fluctuating results in Alpha performance are common and can be due to various factors like random noise, overfitting, or external events. To improve these fluctuations, it’s helpful to examine the year-by-year performance, especially for dips during specific years. Neutralizing risks tied to certain periods, using operators like group_neutralize or vector_neut, and filling data with backfill operators can help address volatility and reduce spiking turnover. Ensuring robust risk-neutralization and eliminating non-essential risks can lead to a more consistent and reliable Alpha.

- Alphas that are not robust may fail to adapt to major market shifts, such as economic crises, financial crashes, or global events (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic). These events cause abrupt market reactions that can significantly affect Alpha performance.
- For example, an Alpha that relies heavily on historical volatility or other indicators that are disrupted by major events may experience a sharp decline in PnL during these times. If the Alpha cannot handle these kinds of extreme market conditions, it may not be viable for long-term use.

It's interesting to see the points you raised about Alpha performance and the impact of year-specific dips. As a high-frequency algo trader, I've faced similar challenges when creating strategies. One key takeaway is the necessity of robust in-sample testing supplemented by consistent out-of-sample performance. Your suggestions on neutralization techniques using group_neutralize and filling operators are also spot on! These methods can greatly enhance Alpha stability, especially when abnormal market events occur. Understanding the market behavior post-events like COVID-19 can shape future Alpha designs. I'm excited to apply some of these insights into my models and hopefully see improvements in performance. Thanks for sharing such valuable tips!
