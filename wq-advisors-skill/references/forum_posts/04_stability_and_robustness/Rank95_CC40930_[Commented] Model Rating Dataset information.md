I was wondering if I could infer more about the Model Rating dataset available. From the PnL graph of a simple alpha model I made, I could notice that the PnL was constant throughout the week and would only change for the next week. So, is the model rating dataset weekwise? Can I have a glance at the dataset?

Hi,

From what you are referring, it looks like the specific data field has coverage issues. Here, usually using this with additional signals, as price volume or fundamentals and with different operators as tradewhen, which applies when specific conditions are met, and if else conditions will be helpful.

If you still face issues with the data, please raise a ticket to support,

The observation that the PnL for your alpha model changes only weekly suggests that your model's predictions or signals might be tied to a dataset that updates on a weekly basis. This could indeed imply that the "Model Rating" dataset you are working with is aggregated or calculated on a weekly timeframe.

### Steps to Confirm

1. **Check the Dataset's Structure:**
   - Inspect the timestamps or date columns in the dataset. If the dataset is week-based, the dates might align with the start or end of weeks (e.g., Mondays or Fridays).
   - Look for regular intervals (e.g., weekly entries for each entity).
2. **Understand the Features:**
   - Identify any features that explicitly indicate temporal aggregation (e.g.,  `week_number` ,  `week_start_date` , etc.).
   - Check if the features represent averages, sums, or other aggregations that imply weekly data.
3. **Validation Through Changes:**
   - Compare the predictions of your model against changes in the dataset. If the predictions remain constant during a week and change at the start of the next, it strongly supports the dataset being weekly.

### Providing the Dataset for Inspection

If you can share a snapshot or describe the dataset's structure, I can provide specific insights. For instance, you can mention:

- Columns and their descriptions (e.g., date, rating, signal values).
- Sample rows to highlight how the data changes over time.

Would you like to upload or describe the dataset so I can help analyze it further?

Hi  [LG55649](/hc/en-us/profiles/11560962194711-LG55649)

It seems the specific data field you're referring to might have coverage issues. To address this, try combining it with additional signals, such as price, volume, or fundamentals, and leverage versatile operators like  `tradewhen`  to apply conditions or  `if-else`  logic to refine your approach. This can help improve the reliability of your Alpha signals. If the issue persists, consider raising a ticket to support for further assistance. Additionally, reviewing data preprocessing methods, such as  `ts_backfill`  or group normalization, could enhance the field’s usability and accuracy.

The observation highlights that the alpha model's weekly PnL changes may stem from a dataset with weekly updates. To confirm, analyze the dataset's timestamps for week-based patterns, inspect features for signs of temporal aggregation, and validate against prediction consistency. Sharing a dataset sample would enable more targeted insights.

Thank you for the detailed breakdown—this makes a lot of sense. Sector or industry-neutral settings clearly offer significant benefits, like reducing market-wide biases and enhancing signal clarity within comparable groups.

I’ll prioritize testing sector-neutral setups as a starting point. Do you have any recommendations on how to balance sector-neutralization with identifying sector-specific opportunities, or how to handle scenarios where neutralization might dilute performance?

Appreciate your insights!

**Hey  [LG55649](/hc/en-us/profiles/11560962194711-LG55649) , it's a good thought to test sector-neutral setups. To balance sector-neutralization with sector-specific opportunities, you could first identify sectors with strong trends or unique characteristics separately. Then, when applying neutralization, maybe use different weights for different sectors based on their historical performance or importance. For cases where it might dilute performance, monitor closely and adjust the neutralization degree accordingly. Hope this helps!**

**Dataset Coverage and Updates** : The observation that the PnL changes weekly suggests that the dataset might be updated on a weekly basis, which could imply that the "Model Rating" dataset is aggregated or calculated on a weekly timeframe. This is an important consideration for modeling as it affects the frequency and reliability of signals.
 **Diagnosing Dataset Issues** : To confirm the weekly nature of the dataset, one can check the timestamps for week-based patterns, inspect features for signs of temporal aggregation, and validate against prediction consistency. This involves understanding the dataset's structure, including columns and their descriptions, and looking for regular intervals or weekly entries.
 **Improving Alpha Model Reliability** : Combining the Model Rating dataset with additional signals such as price, volume, or fundamentals, and using versatile operators like  `tradewhen`  can help improve the reliability of Alpha signals. If issues persist, raising a ticket to support for further assistance is recommended.

The  **Model Rating dataset**  that you're referring to seems to be a collection of performance metrics, typically including ratings or performance scores assigned to models based on how well they perform over time. These scores could be applied on various time intervals, such as weekly, daily, or monthly, depending on the system and model you're working with.
