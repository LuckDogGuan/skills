Most of us routinely apply neutralization against sectors or countries, but I’ve found  **liquidity and volatility neutralization**  equally powerful.
For example:

`neutralize(alpha_signal, liquidity)
`

stabilized high-turnover signals by stripping out liquidity bias. In another case, volatility-neutralization reduced clustering of trades during high-risk regimes.

But there’s a caveat: sometimes the bias (e.g., liquidity preference) is actually the alpha’s edge. Over-neutralizing can “throw the baby out with the bathwater.”

👉 Question: Do you experiment with liquidity/volatility neutralization, or stick to traditional sector/country neutralization only?

Interesting point. Liquidity and volatility neutralization can definitely add robustness, especially in stabilizing turnover and reducing regime-specific risks. But I agree it’s important to test both full and partial versions, since in some cases the so-called bias may actually be the true alpha driver.

Good observation—liquidity and volatility neutralization can certainly improve robustness by stabilizing turnover and cutting down regime-dependent risks. Still, it’s essential to compare full versus partial neutralization, because in some cases what looks like a structural “bias” is actually the core source of alpha, and removing it can weaken the signal.
