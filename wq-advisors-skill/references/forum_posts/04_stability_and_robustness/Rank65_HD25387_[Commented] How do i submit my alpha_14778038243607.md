I'm unable to submit alpha. I have one alpha that doesn't meet fitness score of 1. I'm not getting an option to submit the alpha.

Hi,
You can refer here to understand results:  [[1/3] Intermediate Pack - Understanding Results – WorldQuant BRAIN](/hc/en-us/articles/14220836385687--1-3-Intermediate-Pack-Understanding-Results-) 
Basically, Fitness = Sharpe * sqrt(abs(Returns)

So, you can increase fitness by increasing Sharpe (or returns) and reducing turnover.

Here are a few strategies to consider:

1. **Increase Sharpe Ratio** : Focus on enhancing the risk-adjusted returns of your alpha. This can be achieved by either increasing the magnitude of your returns or by reducing the volatility (risk) associated with those returns.
2. **Reduce Turnover** : A high turnover can negatively impact your fitness score. Look for ways to reduce the frequency of trades within your strategy without compromising the alpha's effectiveness.
3. **Backtesting** : Utilize backtesting to identify periods where your alpha performed well or poorly and make adjustments accordingly. This can help you understand how changes in your strategy affect both returns and risk.
4. **Peer Review** : Sometimes, getting a fresh perspective can be invaluable. Share your alpha with peers or on forums to get feedback on potential improvements.

Remember, the goal is to create a balance between generating returns and managing risk efficiently. It might take several iterations to get the desired results, but with careful tuning and testing, you can improve your alpha's fitness score and make it submittable. Good luck!

Hi, please refer to the alpha templates and alpha ideas posted on the community, then use ACE lib to automate the alpha search. I believe you will find alphas with very good signals.

**Hey! I agree with what  [NL41370](/hc/en-us/profiles/11433604068887-NL41370) ,  [BA51127](/hc/en-us/profiles/8958551180311-BA51127)  and  [TN48752](/hc/en-us/profiles/13714359745431-TN48752)  said. Besides those ways, you can also analyze your alpha's factor exposure carefully. Make sure it's not overly concentrated on certain factors which might cause instability. And check if there are any outliers in your data that could affect the fitness score. Also, study similar successful alphas in the community to learn some good practices. Hope these tips help you get your alpha submitted soon.**

**The fitness score is key to submitting an alpha.**

If your alpha doesn’t meet the minimum fitness score of 1, you won’t be able to submit it. Here are some tips to improve your alpha and make it eligible for submission:

1. **Refine Your Alpha:**
   - Adjust your parameters to improve Sharpe, reduce turnover, and ensure it performs consistently across IS, Test, and OS.
2. **Debug Your Expression:**
   - Simplify your expression to isolate what might be causing low performance. Focus on optimizing the core logic first.
3. **Explore Dataset and Neutralization Options:**
   - Try using datasets with low competition or experiment with neutralization settings like Slow, Fast, or both to enhance signal robustness.

Once the alpha’s fitness score improves, the submission option should become available. Good luck, and feel free to ask for help if you need further assistance! 😊

- **Sharpe**  is the Sharpe ratio, which measures the risk-adjusted return of your model. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates that your returns are higher relative to the volatility (risk).
- **Returns**  are the model’s daily returns, and the absolute value of returns is taken to emphasize performance regardless of direction (positive or negative).
- The square root of absolute returns is used to temper large returns, providing a more balanced view of risk-adjusted performance.
