## 帖子正文

Instead of just blending alphas post-hoc, I’ve had success designing  **cross-dataset interactions**  within expressions:

`rank(anlystsn/adv20) * rank(ts_zscore(fundamental_PE, 60))
`

This captures stocks with analyst support AND attractive valuations. In MAPC, such interactions often reduce Prod Corr while boosting Sharpe.

Downside: complexity increases risk of overfitting. My approach:

- Keep formulas short (≤3 main operators).
- Stress test across multiple universes.
- Only retain signals robust to neutralization.

👉 Question: Do you prefer simple independent signals combined later, or richer interaction alphas upfront?

Great question — I think there’s value in both approaches, depending on the stage of research.

Independent signals combined later are easier to interpret, debug, and recycle across universes. They reduce the risk of overfitting since each component stands on its own and can be validated independently. This modularity also makes it easier to diagnose which parts of the portfolio are adding value.

On the other hand, well-designed interaction alphas can sometimes capture subtler relationships that simple blends miss. For example, combining sentiment with valuation or volume factors often produces richer signals, as you’ve shown. The key is to keep them concise, apply stress tests across universes, and ensure robustness under neutralization to avoid spurious correlations.

Personally, I start with independent signals for stability, then selectively introduce interaction terms only where there’s strong intuition or empirical support. That balance usually provides the best mix of robustness and innovation.

Independent signals that are combined later tend to be easier to interpret, debug, and reuse across regions, and they also lower overfitting risk since each component can be validated on its own. This modular structure makes it clearer which pieces of the portfolio are truly contributing. Still, well-crafted interaction alphas can uncover more nuanced relationships that simple blends might overlook—pairings like sentiment with valuation or volume often yield richer behavior, as you noted. The key is to keep these interactions focused, stress-test them across universes, and confirm they remain robust under neutralization to avoid misleading correlations. My approach is to begin with independent signals for stability and then introduce interaction terms only when there’s solid intuition or empirical evidence, which usually strikes the best balance between robustness and innovation.

Building signals as standalone components that are merged later generally improves clarity, makes troubleshooting simpler, and allows reuse across markets, while also reducing overfitting because each signal can be tested independently. This modular setup helps pinpoint which elements are actually driving portfolio performance. That said, thoughtfully designed interaction alphas can reveal subtler dynamics that linear combinations may miss—combinations such as sentiment with valuation or volume often produce more informative behavior. The important part is to keep these interactions narrowly scoped, validate them across different universes, and ensure they remain stable after neutralization so they don’t rely on spurious relationships. I typically start with independent signals to establish robustness, then layer in interaction terms only when supported by strong intuition or consistent empirical results, which tends to balance reliability with discovery.

Interesting approach. I usually prefer simple independent signals combined later, but I agree that carefully designed cross-dataset interactions can reduce Prod Corr if stress-tested properly.
