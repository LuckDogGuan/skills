Hi everyone,

Recently, I’ve been simulating several alphas in the  **IND**  region. I noticed that this region often shows relatively high  **Sharpe**  and  **Fitness**  scores; however, my  **Robust Sharpe**  remains quite low.

I’ve tried a number of approaches, such as reducing  **decay**  to suppress noisy signals, but the Robust Sharpe score hasn’t improved significantly.

Could anyone suggest some ideas or directions to help improve  **Robust Sharpe**  for alphas in the IND region?

Thanks everyone for your insights and suggestions.

Low Robust Sharpe with high standard Sharpe indicates sub-period instability, common in volatile markets like IND. Try rank-based transformations ( `ts_rank` ) for outlier resistance, test sub-industry neutralization to handle sector concentration, and lengthen lookback windows rather than just lowering decay. The key is checking performance during high-volatility regimes specifically - your alpha likely works in calm periods but breaks during stress. What neutralization level and operator structure are you currently using?

In the IND region, low Robust Sharpe is often structural due to uneven liquidity, high volatility, and execution frictions. Beyond lowering decay, focus on  **rank-based cross-sectional signals** , apply  **stronger winsorization/truncation** , and consider  **deeper neutralization (sub-industry or market)** . Avoid absolute-value signals; relative signals with lower turnover tend to be more stable. Most importantly, filter out short-term “lucky” alphas via rolling-window checks, parameter sensitivity tests, and early MaxTrade stress-testing.

That’s a good observation, and it’s something many people run into with IND. The region can look very attractive on headline metrics, but Robust Sharpe is often where fragility shows up.

A few directions that tend to help:

- **Stress-test assumptions early.**  Robust Sharpe is very sensitive to regime dependence. Try checking whether the alpha’s performance is coming from a specific market phase, sector cluster, or a small subset of names. If removing a period, sector, or tail days causes a big drop, the signal may be structurally narrow.
- **Reduce concentration, not just noise.**  Lowering decay helps with noise, but low Robust Sharpe often comes from weight or exposure concentration. Using group-level neutralization, clipping, or scaling operators can make performance more evenly distributed across stocks and time.
- **Check turnover consistency.**  In IND, it’s common to see signals that look slow on average but rely on sharp inflections. If a 1-day delay or small turnover constraint breaks the alpha, Robust Sharpe will stay low. Making the signal genuinely slower and more stable can help.
- **Test cross-settings stability.**  Vary neutralization schemes, decay windows, or even nearby universes. If the alpha only works under one exact configuration, Robust Sharpe will reflect that fragility.
- **Look at return distribution, not just averages.**  Alphas driven by a few strong outlier days often score well on Sharpe but poorly on robustness. Tail-handling or smoothing can help, but only if it aligns with the underlying logic.

In short, improving Robust Sharpe in IND is usually less about squeezing more performance out of the signal and more about making its behavior broader, more even, and less dependent on specific conditions.

In my experience, IND alphas benefit from longer lookbacks and simpler structures. Short windows often look good IS but collapse under robustness tests due to liquidity and volatility shifts.
