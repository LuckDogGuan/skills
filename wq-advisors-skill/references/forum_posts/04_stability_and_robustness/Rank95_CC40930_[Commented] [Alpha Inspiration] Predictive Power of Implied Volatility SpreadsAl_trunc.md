**Exploring the Predictive Power of Implied Volatility Spreads on Stock Returns**

Among the myriad of metrics and strategies that traders and investors employ, the implied volatility spread stands out as a particularly intriguing predictor of stock performance. This spread, defined as the difference between the implied volatilities of call and put options for the same stock, has been found to have a significant predictive ability on future stock returns.

**Understanding the Implied Volatility Spread**

Implied volatility represents the market's forecast of a stock's volatility over the life of the option. Typically, a higher implied volatility suggests that the market expects the stock to be more volatile, which can be indicative of upcoming price movements. The spread between the implied volatility of call options and put options, therefore, can signal discrepancies in market expectations regarding upward versus downward movements.

**The Predictive Power of the Spread**

Recent analyses have shed light on the remarkable ability of high implied volatility spreads to predict superior stock performance. Specifically, stocks exhibiting higher spreads between the call and put option implied volatilities tend to outperform those with narrower spreads. This phenomenon suggests that the implied volatility spread can serve as a valuable tool for identifying stocks with potential for higher returns.

**Theoretical Insights and Empirical Evidence**

The phenomenon can be partially explained through the lens of put-call parity and deviations from it. Put-call parity is a principle that guides the pricing relationship between call and put options. Deviations from this parity, as signaled by the implied volatility spread, suggest that one market (either options or stocks) may possess information not yet reflected in the other. This discrepancy can create opportunities for investors who can identify and act on the information implied by the spread.

Can you use trade_when operator with option volume to reduce the turnover of the signal?

Good question. A little bit of thinking will give you the answer to your question. Once you apply a cross-sectional operator on any datafield, the operator will compare values between all the stocks of the universe and give out values accordingly. This will result in quite a different result when compared to the above. However, this can be an alpha too, let me know if you got any good results trying this :)

Great ideas,

I just wondering if the implementation: operator_1(implied_volatility_call_n) - operator_2(implied_volatility_put_n), where operator_1, operator_2 can be transformational or cross-sectional and n is the number, would carry out the same signal meaning from the post's' original ideas.

Maybe this shall be interpreted as the minus of two signal rather than one original signal.

What do you think about this specification?

Thanks.

Great comments,

Thank you for your suggestions.

You are definitely right when explaining that apply operator separately before subtraction may give different results since they may signifies different alpha ideas interpretation due to the order in which we apply those operator.

But from a technical perspective, can we look at the cross-sectional/transformational operator as an intitial step to handle, clean and smooth our datafields before using them to create alphas? That is operator(datafield) ~= processed datafields. So can I interpret the expression: operator_1(implied_volatility_call_n) - operator_2(implied_volatility_put_n) as proceeded(implied_volatility_call_n) - proceeded(implied_volatility_put_n)? If so, can we view them as an adjusted version of our original ideas based on the difference of call and put values?

Thanks for the interesting discussion and comments,

Question
I was able to reduce the turnover significantly and got quite a decent alpha in terms of sharpe, fitness and returns-to-drawdown ratio. But I'm stuck at the sub-universe sharpe test. I saw that the alpha is not performing well for highly liquid stocks. 

Any approach or tip to rectify it would be a great help.

PS: I have already referred the help link provided but it was not of much use.

You can try to create liquid / non-liquid group through the use of buckets and PV1 data. After that you can use group_normalize operator to force the trading size on liquid part to be larger than non-liquid part.

Or you may consider defining a series of factors related to liquidity, and try to remove that from your original Alpha through vector_neut or group_neutralize.

At the end of the day, if your current Alpha are contributed mostly by illiquid factor, I will suggest you to try a different approach completely. Since if that is your case, removing/  controlling illiquid factor will remove most of the performance.

Hi,

In my limited experience, to further solve the issue at sub-universe sharpe test, and add up to the potential solutions spaces, we may look at and briefly analyze the concept of liquidity.

An articles from Investopedia [blocked link], liquidity measures how easily an asset can be transfer into ready cash without affecting its market price. It show us how easily an asset can be sold at reasonable price.

On the stock market, for example, when experiencing some shocks or abnormal events that could potentially affects the stock prices, such as company-related news, or unexpected changes in market conditions, or a change in regulation that could potentially affect the industry and the stock prices, a liquid stock could easily been sold upon investors' wish without losing significant values, converting their assets from stocks to cash.

This make liquid stocks gain more attention from investors, be trade more often, and more sentitive to changes in the market variables. Since illiquid stocks are hard to trade, investors may be more careful in choosing these stocks, trade less frequently, making them less likely to be effects in a significant scales than liquid stocks when changes occur in the market.

Therefore, the liquid stocks are being influenced by more complex factors than the illiquid stocks, making their respective Alphas (predictive model) more complex and customized than illiquid stocks. This may lead to beside the initial formula, we need to integrate more information into our Alphas to capture the characteristics of liquid stocks more comprehensively.

For example, some illiquid stocks may have quite simple stock prices moving patterns, requiring investors less information when trading these stocks. They may need to look at the company fundamental and the trends in stocks prices to buy and hold for a period of time, since they are less convenient to trade often.

With more liquid stocks, there could be a more complex sets of factors that could affects their stock prices, and their stock prices movement pattern may be more complex, thus need more complex features and formulas. Since they gain more attention from and more tradable to the investors, a change in the company, industry, market condition or regulations may affect them more easily, making their stock prices patterns sometimes distinctive from the overall movement in the markets.

For example, some large corporations' stocks may move quite distinctive apart from the overall market trends, making investors more customized and individualized approach when trading these types of stocks. Or some new regulations concerning some small set of big corporations or specialized industries may lead to individual changes in their respective stocks prices.

These big stocks can even influence the industry and market. If we consider the 80/20 rules, 20% of the stocks have influences on 80% of the markets.

The above distictive and influential features of high liquid and big stocks make us pay more attention to them when developing our Alphas formula to model and predict their stocks prices, requiring more complex, detailed and customized approach.

Therefore, we may need to incorporate more information into our formula to more closely reflect the changes in the overall markets. A potential approach may be the usage of some adjusting tools to further incorporate more relevant and predictive information (such as *(1+ts_rank(associated information, t))), but not change much our original formulas or some change in the simulation settings.

Thank you for your suggestion to further develop the model.

What do you think about the above analysis?

Hi,

Some further approaches we may consider may be decay-related:

1. Either change the decay settings,
2. Or apply decay-related operator such as hump, hump_decay, ts_decay_linear, ts_decay_exp_window.
3. Or we may create some additional version of the Alphas using specification in time parameters such as ts_decay_linear(alpha, t1), ts_decay_linear(alpha, t2),.... and try to combine them in some ways to create a new signals.

Hope it may help.

AD15238, for the sub-universe Sharpe test issue with highly liquid stocks, YW42946's suggestions are good. Using buckets and PV1 data to create liquid/non-liquid groups and then using group_normalize operator is worth a try. Also, considering factors related to liquidity and using vector_neut or group_neutralize might work. TN67143's decay-related approaches like changing decay settings or applying decay operators can also be explored. Good luck with improving your alpha!

**[AD15238](/hc/en-us/profiles/18114550042647-AD15238) , there are indeed several good suggestions here. YW42946's idea of using buckets and PV1 data to handle liquid/non-liquid groups is practical. Also, considering liquidity factors and using neutralize operators makes sense. TN67143's decay-related approaches offer another angle. You could try combining these methods step by step and see which works best for your alpha in the sub-universe Sharpe test. Hope it gets improved soon.**

The discussion on the "Predictive Power of Implied Volatility Spreads Alpha Idea" highlights the use of implied volatility spreads as a predictor of stock performance. Here are three key points from the conversation:

1. **Understanding Implied Volatility Spread** : The spread between call and put option implied volatilities is a significant predictor of future stock returns. Stocks with higher spreads tend to outperform those with narrower spreads.
2. **BRAIN Implementation** : The quantile function is used to analyze the difference between call and put implied volatilities. There's a suggestion to use trade_when operator with option volume to reduce signal turnover.
3. **Challenges with Liquid Stocks** : There's a noted challenge with the alpha not performing well for highly liquid stocks. Suggestions include creating liquid/non-liquid groups using buckets and PV1 data, neutralizing liquidity factors, and exploring decay-related approaches to improve performance in the sub-universe Sharpe test.

This alpha strategy using implied volatility spreads is an interesting approach to predicting stock returns. By focusing on the difference between call and put option implied volatilities, you are leveraging market sentiment to identify potential price movements. Using the  `quantile`  operator to classify stocks based on this spread makes sense, as it allows you to focus on the stocks with the highest predictive potential. Additionally, incorporating the  `trade_when`  operator with option volume as a filter is a smart way to reduce turnover by ensuring that only stocks with significant market activity are included. This combination of implied volatility analysis and option volume could provide valuable insights for your strategy.

This alpha strategy leverages the spread between call and put implied volatilities to capture market sentiment and predict stock returns. The quantile operator effectively prioritizes stocks with the strongest predictive signals, focusing on high-potential opportunities. Incorporating the trade_when operator with an option volume filter further refines the strategy by ensuring sufficient market activity, reducing noise and turnover. This integration of sentiment analysis via implied volatility and liquidity screening through volume provides a robust and insightful framework for identifying alpha-generating opportunities.

To mitigate the impact of illiquidity, consider grouping assets into liquid and illiquid buckets using volume or price volatility data. Then, employ the  `group_normalize`  operator to prioritize trading in the liquid bucket. Alternatively, define a series of liquidity-related factors and neutralize them from your original Alpha using  `vector_neut`  or  `group_neutralize` . However, if your Alpha's performance primarily stems from illiquid assets, a complete re-evaluation of your approach may be necessary, as neutralizing or constraining illiquidity could significantly diminish returns.

### nspiration] Predictive Power of Implied Volatility Spreads

**Title and Author of the Article:**

- *Volatility Spreads and Stock Returns*  by M. J. Brennan, E. H. Schwartz (1993)

**Alpha Inspiration Description:**

- The concept of implied volatility spreads involves the difference between the implied volatility (IV) of two related options—often between out-of-the-money (OTM) and in-the-money (ITM) options. A wide implied volatility spread typically signals increased uncertainty or anticipated large movements in stock prices. Conversely, a narrow implied volatility spread suggests a more stable or predictable outlook.
- This alpha idea is based on the hypothesis that the implied volatility spread can be a leading indicator of stock returns. When volatility spreads widen, it may indicate increased investor uncertainty or market stress, potentially foreshadowing higher volatility in the stock's price. Conversely, a narrowing spread may signal market confidence or stability, often associated with lower future volatility and potential price stability.
- The strategy would involve analyzing the IV spread of options for a particular stock or index. When the implied volatility spread exceeds a certain threshold (indicating high market uncertainty), it may signal a short-term opportunity to trade on the expected price movement (e.g., going long on volatility or hedging against market downturns). Similarly, when the spread is very narrow, it could indicate a buying opportunity for stable, less volatile assets.

**Related Dataset:**

- **Options Dataset** : Implied volatility data for different strike prices and maturities.
- **Equity Returns Data** : Stock price data for assessing the correlation between IV spreads and future stock returns.
- **Volatility Index (VIX)** : For understanding overall market sentiment and implied volatility in the broader market.

**(Optional) Current Performance of P&L or Matrix:**

- Backtest this alpha by monitoring changes in implied volatility spreads over a 30-day or 60-day period.
- Assess the stock returns after significant changes in volatility spreads.
- Evaluate performance with metrics like cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and win ratio.

**Questions and Improvement Ideas:**

- How could using different maturities for options impact the predictive power of IV spreads?
- Would combining IV spreads with other factors (e.g., technical indicators like RSI or MACD) improve the prediction accuracy?
- Can implied volatility spreads provide a more reliable signal in high-volatility environments, such as during earnings announcements or geopolitical events?

**Tag:**  Alpha Idea

This alpha idea explores how options data, specifically the spread in implied volatility between different options, could predict short-term stock movements. It ties into the broader concept of volatility as a key driver of market behavior and may offer valuable insights when combined with other factor.
