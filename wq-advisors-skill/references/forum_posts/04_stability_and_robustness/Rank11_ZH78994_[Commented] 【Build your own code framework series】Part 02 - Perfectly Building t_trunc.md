## I. A Brief Introduction to Redis

Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source high-performance key-value storage system. It supports multiple data structures, such as strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes. Redis not only supports simple key-value pair storage but also provides a rich set of operation interfaces, enabling it to play an important role in various application scenarios. The author mainly uses lists. Implementing a first-in-first-out mechanism to build a backtesting pool (lpush), and a first-in-last-out mechanism to achieve queue jumping (rpush). The rollback function can be achieved by adding some tag information when pushing the past JSON queue, and then writing a specific small reading function to implement rollback (the author hasn't had time to implement it yet).

## II. Specific Scenarios and Implementations

refer:   [【Build your own code framework series】Part 01 - Use MySQL to perfectly save all backtested alphas]([Commented] 【Build your own code framework series】Part 01 - Use MySQL to perfectly save all backtested alphas.md)

### 2.1 redisinstallation

MySQL and redis need to be installed. For easy installation, I used the Pagoda panel (I won’t go into too much detail here)

### 2.2 Push task example

```
total_results = []with pymysql.connect(host=mysql_host, port=mysql_port, user=mysql_user, password=mysql_password, database=mysql_db) as conn:    with conn.cursor() as cursor:        for dataset_id in dataset_ids:            sql = ("select t.field,t.type "                    f"from worldquant.{region}_DELAY1 t "                    f"where t.datasets = '{dataset_id}' "                    f"order by t.alphaCount desc "                    "limit 2000 "                    "OFFSET 0"                )            cursor.execute(sql)            results = cursor.fetchall()            total_results.extend(results)# The above is how mysql obtains fields and field types (this means that I have moved the datasets information back to my own library in advance)
```

```
pc_fields = []for result in total_results:    if result[1] == 'MATRIX':    elif result[1] == 'VECTOR':        for item in get_vec_fields([result[0]]):            first_order = first_order_factory(pc_fields, ts_ops)    so_alpha_list = []for exp in first_order:    so_alpha_list.append([exp, 6])
```

```
r = redis.StrictRedis(host='host', port=6379, password='......', db=0, decode_responses=True)end_info = {    'task_type': 'end',    'task_name': 'news18,79,50'}# r.rpush("alpha_pools", json.dumps(end_info))for i in range(0, len(so_alpha_list), 100):    pool = {        "settings": settings,        "alpha_list": so_alpha_list[i:i+100],    }    r.lpush("alpha_pools", json.dumps(pool))r.lpush("alpha_pools", json.dumps(end_info))
```

It can be seen that ① the fields are also collected locally ② the template can be changed every time a task is launched, that is, the production alpha expression and the backtest task are decoupled ③ intermittent information functions such as end_info can be used in the backtest When this information is read, it means that the task is over, and you can make your own notification reminder (the author uses Alibaba Cloud's SMS reminder, which is not expensive. There are free email reminders used by friends)

This guide effectively demonstrates the use of Redis for managing backtesting tasks, combined with MySQL for data retrieval. By leveraging Redis queues ( `lpush` ,  `rpush` ), it enables a flexible, scalable, and decoupled framework for alpha generation and testing. Key features include dynamic task preparation, end-of-task signals ( `end_info` ), and automated notifications via SMS or email. Decoupling alpha expression generation from backtesting enhances flexibility, while Redis ensures efficient task handling. Future enhancements could include robust error handling, finalizing the rollback mechanism, and performance monitoring for better task management. This framework is a powerful tool for optimizing alpha research workflows. 🚀
