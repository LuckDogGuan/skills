Unstable Alpha outputs cause PnL fluctuations. Use decay() or average() operators and adjust truncation to produce a more stable PnL curve.

Good tip, smoothing and truncation can make a big difference in stabilizing alpha performance.

Exactly — applying decay() or average() smooths out noisy short-term movements, reducing sharp PnL swings. Pairing this with proper truncation or clipping helps control outliers, leading to steadier, more reliable alpha performance.

Absolutely. Unstable Alpha outputs often translate directly into erratic PnL behavior. Applying decay or averaging operators, along with carefully chosen truncation levels, can smooth signal fluctuations and lead to a more consistent and controllable PnL profile.
