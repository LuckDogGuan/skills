The issue of low Robust is the problem in IND region but I have recently created an alpha that have passed the tests through simulating alphas using lower DECAY values

Good thought, robust universe has been a problem for me. Waiting to get from the community.

Hey

Can you please explain what you mean by "lower DECAY values "

Great observation — the IND region’s Robust Sharpe requirement is definitely one of the toughest hurdles on Brain. Many alphas produce good Sharpe on IS or FS, but the cross-universe robustness check often collapses them. What you’ve highlighted about using lower DECAY values is actually a meaningful insight.

Thank you for sharing. Could you explain a bit more about why using a lower decay is effective and what the underlying principle is?

This is a very relevant observation for the IND region, where Robust Sharpe is often the main bottleneck rather than raw IS performance. Lowering DECAY can genuinely help in IND because it changes how quickly the signal reacts to new information. With lower decay, the alpha puts more weight on the most recent data, which is often beneficial in noisier markets like IND where regimes shift faster and stale information can actively hurt robustness. Many IND alphas fail robustness because they implicitly rely on slower-moving structure that does not generalize well across sub-universes or time slices. By reducing decay, you are effectively shortening the signal’s memory, which can reduce cross-universe instability and dampen overfitting to older patterns. That said, lower decay usually increases turnover, so the key is finding a balance where the signal remains responsive without becoming overly noisy or uninvestable. Combining lower decay with strong normalization, ranking, and liquidity-aware universes often improves Robust Sharpe materially in IND.

You’re absolutely right, since meeting the Robust Sharpe threshold in the IND universe is one of the most demanding challenges on Brain. It’s common to see alphas look strong in IS or FS, only to break down once cross-universe robustness is enforced. That’s why your point about favoring lower decay settings is especially valuable. Shorter decays often help strip away slow, overfit structure and force the signal to rely on more persistent behavior, which tends to survive robustness checks better. This kind of adjustment may not always maximize headline Sharpe, but it often leads to signals that generalize more reliably across regimes and universes.
