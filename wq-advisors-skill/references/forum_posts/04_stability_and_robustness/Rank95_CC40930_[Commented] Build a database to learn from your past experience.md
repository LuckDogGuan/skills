**Build a database to learn from your past experience**

Understanding the performance of past Alphas is as important as coming up with new Alpha ideas. In this forum post, we explore a few different ways in which you can build a database of your past Alphas and learn from their performance:

1. **Logging Stats:** The first step towards building a database is logging every result of your simulations. Here are some ways you can do it:
   1. **simulate_alpha_list_multi()** function of ace_lib, used to simulate Alphas, will return a data frame with IS stats (like Sharpe, Turnover, Drawdown etc) for each Alpha. Storing the data frame as a ‘.csv’ or ‘.pickle’ file can help you save these results and retrieve them later for analysis.
   2. **get_alpha_pnl()** function allows you to get daily Alpha PnL for a given Alpha (using it’s Alpha ID). Alphas that have interesting PnL charts can be retrieved and saved using this function as a ‘.csv’ or ‘.pickle’ file.
2. **Analyzing results:** Once the results have been saved, one can analyze the data to uncover unique insights. You can try:
   1. **Grouping:** Alphas can be grouped together on multiple metrics and sub-metrics.
   1. based on Alpha neutralization (SUBINDUSTRY, INDUSTRY, Risk-Handled)
   2. based on dataset used (fundamental, pv, model, other etc.)
   3. based on operator (cross-sectional, time-series, both, other)
   2. **Sorting:** Within each group, one can sort the Alphas based on Sharpe/Fitness to understand the performance:
   1. What kind of neutralization gives best performance generally? Is it related to the idea of the Alpha? For example, does Risk-Handled neutralization lead to worse performance in alphas?
   2. What is the average Sharpe for fundamental Alphas? Do technical Alphas have higher turnover in general? What is the coverage represented by long-short count for underutilized datasets?
   3. Do certain datasets lead to an Alpha with better performance using time-series operator over cross-sectional, or vice-versa? Is it beneficial to use multiple operators with a single datafield?

The answers from these data-backed insights can help you make necessary changes to your research approach and make more submissions for ACE!

The article on building a database to learn from past Alpha experiences provides a valuable framework for improving future strategies. It emphasizes the importance of logging results, which can be done using functions like simulate_alpha_list_multi() and get_alpha_pnl(), to store essential metrics like Sharpe, turnover, and drawdown. I particularly liked how the article guides users on organizing and sorting the data by various factors such as neutralization, dataset type, and operator used. This structured approach to categorizing past alphas helps identify trends and areas for improvement, allowing one to optimize future submissions. Analyzing these results by comparing metrics, like Sharpe ratios across different neutralizations or operator types, can uncover patterns that enhance alpha development. This method of continuous feedback and data-driven optimization aligns perfectly with my goal of refining and strengthening quantitative strategies over time.

Building a database of past Alphas is a great way to refine your strategies and gain deeper insights into what works and what doesn't. By systematically logging simulation results and analyzing them across different categories, you can uncover patterns that lead to better decision-making in future Alpha creation. It's essential to track various metrics such as Sharpe ratio, turnover, and PnL for each Alpha, as well as the datasets and operators used.

### 1.  **Logging Stats**

The first step in building a robust database is to log the results of your simulations. By keeping track of key performance metrics, you can analyze the success and failure of different strategies over time. Here are a few methods you can use to log and save your results:

- **Using  `simulate_alpha_list_multi()`** : This function from  `ace_lib`  can simulate multiple Alphas and return a data frame with key in-sample statistics such as  **Sharpe Ratio** ,  **Turnover** , and  **Drawdown** . Storing the resulting data frame as a  `.csv`  or  `.pickle`  file allows you to preserve the data and access it later for further analysis.

If the change from  **SLOW Factors**  to  **FAST Factors**  significantly lowers the  **Sharpe Ratio** , it's possible that the underlying  **alpha signals** , like mean reversion, might not be properly captured. FAST factors can introduce  **noise**  into your model, which might distort the behavior of time-sensitive strategies. This is why you should carefully analyze whether the new factors align with the intended alpha strategy or if unintended factors are influencing the model.

In MAPC, Modern Portfolio Theory provides valuable insights for constructing an optimal portfolio of Alphas. By diversifying across Alphas with different risk and return profiles, you can reduce risk while maximizing expected returns. Focus on low-correlation Alphas, optimize for a balanced risk-return profile, and keep turnover in check to enhance your Merged Performance Score. With these strategies, you can improve your performance in MAPC and position yourself for better outcomes in future submissions.

@NL41370

Thank you for the informative post.

I have two questions:
1. Storing and reviewing past Alphas is good. However, I think the stored results might not be accurate at the present time. I often see many changes after each OS update. But I'm concerned that even without updates, these results are no longer as accurate as they were during the past simulation. Is that correct?

2. Instead of learning from IS, can I learn from OS? My idea is to re-evaluate Alphas with good OS, especially after each system-wide OS update. I will choose the Alphas with good OS and then base new Alpha development on those ideas. There's a possibility of overfitting, but I want to ask if this approach is effective?

The "rank effect" describes the tendency for investors to sell their best and worst-performing assets, while holding on to the average performers. This behavior contrasts with the "disposition effect," which refers to the tendency to sell winners too soon and hold on to losers for too long. The rank effect is distinct in that it doesn't necessarily address any systematic risks that could influence overall performance.

- Calculate  **ts_max**  and examine its relationship with returns. Use it as a feature to understand whether significant historical highs correlate with strong future performance.
- Analyze  **ts_corr**  to identify how institutional fields (e.g., investment amount, stock positions) relate to future returns, refining your dataset for predictive analysis.

- The  **rank effect**  refers to a specific behavior of investors where they are more likely to sell their best and worst-performing assets in their portfolios, rather than the average performers.
- This means investors are often trying to lock in profits from their winners and cut losses from their losers, avoiding the middle ground.

To build a strong Alpha, you need to combine unique strategic ideas, use quality data, and apply neutralization methods (such as industry or risk group neutralization). Additionally, managing risk and optimizing the model through techniques like backtesting, Sharpe ratio, and cross-validation are crucial to ensure Alpha delivers sustainable profits

Building a comprehensive database to analyze past Alpha performance is an essential step in refining quantitative strategies. By systematically logging results and categorizing them by factors like neutralization, dataset, and operators, you can uncover actionable insights that directly improve your future submissions. One key consideration is not only evaluating performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio and turnover, but also revisiting the rationale behind each Alpha. Understanding the logic behind successful strategies, along with any external factors that may have contributed to their success or failure, can help shape more effective Alpha development going forward.
