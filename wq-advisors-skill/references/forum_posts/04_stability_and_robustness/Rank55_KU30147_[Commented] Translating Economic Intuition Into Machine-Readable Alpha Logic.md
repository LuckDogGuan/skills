I've found that the gap between economic intuition and alpha expression often lies in the temporal dimension. For instance, mean reversion intuition is straightforward, but translating it requires careful consideration of lookback windows and decay functions.

One approach I've used: start with the simplest possible expression of your intuition, then layer in complexity only where the data demands it. The simulator often reveals which parts of your economic story actually matter for P&L.

Curious if others use a systematic framework for this translation process?

Bridging intuition to alpha works best through progressive formalization. Begin with a minimal operator set that encodes the core economic idea, then iteratively test lookbacks, decay, and normalization. Let simulator diagnostics guide refinement. This disciplined layering exposes which assumptions drive P&L and avoids overfitting intuition into fragile complexity.

Good point on the temporal dimension - timing parameters often make or break economically sound ideas. I use a similar iterative approach: test the core signal first with minimal operators, then add complexity only where IS/OOS performance justifies it. One useful framework is separating signal generation from signal conditioning (decay, normalization) and testing each independently. This isolates whether your intuition is valid before layering operations. Do you systematically test different decay functions, or rely mainly on the standard Brain options?

I follow a very similar approach: start with the simplest expression that directly reflects the economic intuition, then let the simulator act as a reality check for which parts actually drive PnL. A framework that works well for me is: (1) clearly define the  *effect*  (reversion, trend, surprise, etc.), (2) choose a time scale consistent with that effect, and (3) only add decay or filters when noise or instability shows up. If an extra layer doesn’t change the economic behavior, I usually remove it.

I use a similar “progressive translation” mindset. I try to lock down the economic effect first, then map it to a time scale that makes sense, and only afterwards worry about decay or conditioning. Treating signal generation and signal conditioning as separate steps has helped me see which parts of the intuition actually matter for P&L and which are just noise-control layers.
