Creating effective D0 alphas using social media data involves capturing real-time sentiment shifts and combining them with other fast-reacting signals. A good approach is to track sentiment changes ( `sentiment_score` ) and activity spikes ( `social_buzz` ), then normalize and combine them with price momentum or analyst forecasts. For example, an alpha like  `rank(sentiment_score) * ts_rank(ret_1d, 5)`  leverages both public opinion and short-term returns. This helps build responsive and diverse D0 alphas.

Hi  [JK98819](/hc/en-us/profiles/4935450091415-JK98819) ,
Social media datasets can provide strong signals at Delay 0 since the information can be monetized with minimal lag. You can experiment with the  `returns`  field using these datasets to design real-time or near real-time Delay 0 alphas for faster signal capture.

You can start by combining social media sentiment and buzz signals with short-term momentum or analyst factors. Focus on capturing fast sentiment shifts and normalize them by country or sector to reduce noise. Always validate your alpha with Sharpe and turnover in the D0 universe to ensure robustness.

Great discussion—social media datasets are definitely powerful for D0 alphas since they capture information flow almost in real time. I think one key challenge is distinguishing  **true sentiment shifts**  from  **noise or hype** . Have you found certain preprocessing steps (like winsorizing, backfilling, or decay) especially useful in stabilizing these signals? Would be great to hear how others are refining social media inputs before combining them with price or analyst data.

A good way to start building alphas with social media datasets is to first decide how to transform raw signals like sentiment polarity, post frequency, or surprise in tone into structured features. For example, you might compute short-term sentiment momentum by applying  `ts_mean`  or  `decay_linear`  to smooth noisy daily scores, then rank them across stocks. Strong combinations often come from blending social sentiment with fundamental or market-driven factors, such as combining sentiment trend with earnings revisions, liquidity, or volatility measures. Another approach is to use sentiment as a filter—only acting on valuation or momentum signals when sentiment is aligned.
