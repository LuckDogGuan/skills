Hi  [顾问 AM60509 (Rank 61)](/hc/en-us/profiles/25127049757975-顾问 AM60509 (Rank 61)) ,
Adding to it, here is how it works

Your approach using  `group = densify(country) + densify(subindustry) * 100`  works as follows:

### **1. Understanding Densify**

`densify(column)`  assigns a  **unique, sequential index**  to each distinct value in the  `column` .

For example: assume

`country       densify(country)
Japan         0
HKG   1
TWN   2
`

`subindustry   densify(subindustry)
Finance       0
Tech    1
Retail  2
`

### **2. Computing the Group Identifier**

The formula:

group=densify(country)+densify(subindustry)×100{group} = {densify(country)} + {densify(subindustry)} times 100group=densify(country)+densify(subindustry)×100

ensures that each unique ( `country` ,  `subindustry` ) pair gets a unique identifier.

### **3. Example Calculation**

Let's say we have these values:

Country
 `densify(country)` 
Subindustry
 `densify(subindustry)` 
Computed Group

Japan
0
Finance
0
0 + 0 × 100 = 0

Japan
0
Tech
1
0 + 1 × 100 = 100

Japan
0
Retail
2
0 + 2 × 100 = 200

HKG
1
Finance
0
1 + 0 × 100 = 1

HKG
1
Tech
1
1 + 1 × 100 = 101

HKG
1
Retail
2
1 + 2 × 100 = 201

 `TWN   ` 
2
Finance
0
2 + 0 × 100 = 2

 `TWN   ` 
2
Tech
1
2 + 1 × 100 = 102

 `TWN   ` 
2
Retail
2
2 + 2 × 100 = 202

When dealing with categorical variables in quantitative models, it's important to create unique group identifiers for efficient analysis. One effective method is  **densify-based encoding** , where categorical values are assigned unique numerical representations. By applying  `densify(region)`  or  `densify(sector)` , we can convert categories into integers and then combine multiple features using weighted sums or multipliers to maintain distinct group identities. This approach is particularly useful in portfolio construction, factor modeling, and risk analysis, ensuring clear differentiation between categories while optimizing computational efficiency.

Great addition! 
To sum it up, using  `group = densify(country) + densify(subindustry) * 100`  creates a unique identifier for each (country, subindustry) pair by assigning sequential indices to both columns and combining them. This method ensures distinct group identifiers, making it easier to process and analyze the data effectively. Nice job! 👍

This approach using  `densify(country) + densify(subindustry) * 100`  is clever but may risk collisions if  `densify(subindustry) >= 100` . Consider using string concatenation ( `str(densify(country)) + "_" + str(densify(subindustry))` ) or a hashing function to ensure uniqueness, especially for large datasets. This could improve scalability and prevent unintended grouping conflicts.

The approach of using  `densify(country) + densify(subindustry) * 100`  is efficient, but as others mentioned, it assumes  `densify(subindustry) < 100` . If the number of subindustries exceeds this, potential collisions may occur. An alternative is to use prime number multipliers (e.g.,  `densify(country) * 101 + densify(subindustry) * 103` ), ensuring a lower risk of overlaps.

While the approach using  `group = densify(country) + densify(subindustry) * 100`  is efficient for moderate-sized datasets, as some users pointed out, it risks collisions if densify(subindustry) exceeds 100. A more scalable alternative is using prime number multipliers, such as  `group = densify(country) * 101 + densify(subindustry) * 103` , which reduces the likelihood of overlapping identifiers. Another approach is applying hashing functions (e.g.,  `hash(densify(country), densify(subindustry))` ) to ensure uniqueness even with larger datasets.

When incorporating categorical variables into quantitative models, assigning unique numerical identifiers ensures efficient processing and differentiation. Densify-based encoding is a powerful approach, transforming categorical values into distinct numerical representations. By utilizing functions like  `densify(region)`  or  `densify(sector)` , categories are mapped to integers, allowing for seamless integration into models. Furthermore, combining multiple categorical features through weighted sums or multipliers preserves their distinct identities, enhancing model accuracy and interpretability.

- **Densify**  ensures that each value in the  **country**  and  **subindustry**  fields is mapped to a unique numeric value, and the multiplication factor (in this case, 100) makes sure there is no overlap between the two fields.
- By  **adding**  the results of the two  **densify**  functions, you create a distinct key for each combination of  **country**  and  **subindustry** .

Your explanation is clear and to the point! It might be helpful to briefly clarify why multiplying by 100 guarantees uniqueness in the Cartesian product and how it affects the subsequent analysis !! thanks

### 评论 #22 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 1年前)

This is a smart way to implement a  **group cartesian product**  using  `densify()` . By assigning a unique numeric code to each  **country**  and  **subindustry** , this formula effectively creates a  **composite group identifier** :

```
group=densify(country)+densify(subindustry)×100
```

Multiplying  **subindustry**  by 100 ensures that different subindustries don’t overlap when added to country IDs.

A key advantage is  **efficiency** —it avoids explicit cartesian joins while preserving group uniqueness. However, ensure the  **scaling factor (100)**  is large enough to prevent ID collisions.

Great trick for Gold Level users!

### 评论 #23 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 1年前)

Absolutely! When dealing with categorical variables in quantitative models, densify-based encoding is a highly effective way to ensure that each category has a unique identifier. By applying the  `densify()`  function, we can assign a unique integer to each categorical value, such as region or sector. The technique becomes even more powerful when combining multiple categorical features, such as  `densify(country)`  and  `densify(subindustry)` , and using weighted sums or multipliers to preserve distinct group identities.

This method not only makes it easier to process and analyze the data, but it also improves computational efficiency, which is crucial in large-scale data models and real-time analytics. In portfolio construction, factor modeling, and risk analysis, ensuring that each group remains distinguishable is key to creating clear and actionable insights.

How do you handle cases where categories have a high cardinality (e.g., a large number of unique values)? Do you find densify-based encoding effective for those as well?

The use of  `group = densify(country) + densify(subindustry) * 100`  is indeed an elegant way to create unique identifiers for categorical pairs. However, as some have pointed out, this approach assumes that  `densify(subindustry) < 100` . If the number of subindustries grows beyond this limit, collisions may occur. A safer alternative is to use prime number multipliers, like  `group = densify(country) * 101 + densify(subindustry) * 103` , which significantly reduces the risk of overlapping identifiers.

This implementation of the group_cartesian_product using densify is quite innovative! It’s interesting to see how creatively you’ve combined the elements. I wonder if you could share more about the potential performance benefits or use cases for this approach compared to the traditional method? Exploring those aspects could provide useful insights for others.

### 评论 #27 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 1年前)

This method of implementing  `group_cartesian_product`  using  `densify`  is both efficient and practical, especially for users at the Gold Level who lack direct access to the operator. However, as some have noted, the approach assumes that  `densify(subindustry) < 100` , which may lead to potential ID collisions if the number of unique subindustries exceeds this limit. One way to mitigate this is to use  **prime number multipliers**  instead of simple factors (e.g.,  `group = densify(country) * 101 + densify(subindustry) * 103` ). This helps ensure that every  `(country, subindustry)`  pair remains distinct even when the number of unique values scales up. Additionally, for datasets with a high cardinality of categorical variables,  **hashing techniques**  could be explored to avoid unintended overlaps while maintaining computational efficiency. Have you tested this method across different market regions to see if the uniqueness holds up in more extensive datasets?
