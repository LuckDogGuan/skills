## 帖子正文

Hi everyone,

I noticed that the ACE library has recently updated one of its functions. I wanted to clarify how this impacts our previously built notebooks.

- Do we need to modify specific parts of our earlier notebooks to align with the new function behavior?
- Has the function signature, default parameters, or return structure changed?
- Or does the update maintain backward compatibility?
- In the worst case, would older notebooks need to be rebuilt entirely?

If anyone has already adapted their workflow after the update, I would really appreciate insights on what exact changes were required.

Thanks in advance!

This is a crucial question for maintaining robust alpha pipelines. MJ38971, I'd be particularly interested to hear if the update introduced any breaking changes to data structures or data types returned by the function, as that can often be the trickiest to refactor. Knowing the exact nature of the changes (e.g., deprecations, new arguments) will certainly guide whether a full rebuild is necessary or just targeted adjustments.

This is a crucial question for maintaining robust workflows! MJ38971, did you check the library's release notes or documentation for any explicit mentions of breaking changes or deprecation notices regarding that function? If backward compatibility is indeed maintained, it's often a good practice to test a few key notebooks that heavily rely on the updated function to ensure no subtle behavioral shifts have occurred.

Hi

The main change is in get_datafields function:

```
def get_datafields(    s: SingleSession,    instrument_type: str = "EQUITY",    region: str = "USA",    delay: int = 1,    universe: str = "TOP3000",    search: str = "",)
```

Now datafields_df = ace.get_datafields(s, region='EUR', delay=1, universe='TOPCS1600') returns all fields for region*delay and does not require dataset_id, theme, data_type parameters, so you need to filter resulting dataframe in Python by yourself (in case if you want particular type of datafields or datafields from specific dataset).

Great question, MJ38971! Understanding the impact of library updates on existing notebooks is crucial for maintaining reproducible research. My experience suggests that function signature changes are the most common culprits for breaking older code; if that's the case here, even a minor parameter addition could necessitate updates. Have you checked the release notes or changelog for the ACE library, as they often detail backward-breaking changes and migration strategies?

### 评论 #22 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 4个月前)

Hi MJ38971, that's a great question and something all of us need to be mindful of with library updates. Typically, ACE aims for backward compatibility, but it's always wise to check the release notes or documentation for the specific function in question to see if there are any subtle behavioral changes or deprecations. If the function signature or return structure *has* changed, a targeted refactor of those specific function calls in older notebooks would likely be necessary, rather than a full rebuild.

---

### 评论 #23 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 4个月前)

Great question, MJ38971! This is a common concern when libraries evolve. Ideally, ACE would maintain backward compatibility, but it's wise to check the release notes specifically for any deprecated features or changed return types. If there are indeed modifications, even minor ones, it's often worth testing a few key notebooks with sample data to spot potential discrepancies before a full audit.
