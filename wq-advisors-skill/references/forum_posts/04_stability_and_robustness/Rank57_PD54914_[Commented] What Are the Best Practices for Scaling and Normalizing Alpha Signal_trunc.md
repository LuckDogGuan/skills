Hello everyone,

While experimenting with different alphas, I’ve noticed that  **scaling and normalization**  play a big role in how signals behave when combined or compared. Sometimes, an unscaled alpha with extreme values can dominate others in a portfolio, leading to imbalance or misleading results.

What are the most effective ways to  **standardize alpha outputs**  before evaluation or combination? Do you prefer techniques like  **z-score normalization** ,  **rank transformation** , or  **min-max scaling** ? And how do you handle scaling for signals that have  **non-stationary distributions**  over time?

Scaling and normalization are very important for alphas (even without signal combination). It usually depends on alpha. Z-score is great for removing outliers and standardizing signals to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Rank transformation, on the other hand, gives an equal distribution and ensures all values are scaled between 0 and 1 (or 0 to 100 if using percentiles), which is super useful for comparing signals on the same scale.

there are also ts_scale and scale operators available

Scaling really affects how signals interact. I usually prefer rank or z-score normalization since they’re more robust across time and distributions.

i normally use rank or z-score they are robust

Scaling really defines how signals interact in a portfolio. I often prefer  **z-score or rank normalization**  for stability, as they handle outliers well. For  **non-stationary signals** , applying rolling z-scores or  `ts_scale()`  helps maintain consistency across time.

Great point — scaling truly impacts Alpha comparability and portfolio balance. Many researchers prefer z-score or rank normalization for robustness, while rolling window standardization helps manage non-stationary signals.

Scaling can significantly influence how signals behave both individually and in combination. Methods like rank transformation or z-score normalization tend to provide more consistency over time, especially when distributions shift. Choosing a robust standardization approach often makes a noticeable difference in signal comparability and portfolio balance.
