## 帖子正文

IS-Ladder test evaluates whether the Alpha’s performance consistently maintains a strong Sharpe ratio across the entire in-sample period.

The test is performed using the following logic:

If IS Sharpe < FAIL_THRESHOLD: return FAIL
Else:
For N_YEARS = 2:10
If Sharpe[N_YEARS] < FAIL_THRESHOLD: return FAIL
Else if Sharpe[N_YEARS] > PASS_THRESHOLD[N_YEARS]: return PASS
Else if Sharpe[N_YEARS] > FAIL_THRESHOLD and Sharpe[N_YEARS] < PASS_THRESHOLD: continue evaluation

**Note:** 
•Sharpe[N_YEARS] represents the Sharpe value for the latest N_YEARS within the in-sample period.
• If the Alpha’s turnover is below 30%, the PASS_THRESHOLD value is multiplied by 0.85 before application. (Note: This adjustment does not affect the FAIL_THRESHOLD value.)

**Tips for Success**

- **Improving IS period performance:**  Build Alpha with strong theoretical justification while using reasonable parameter values (e.g., 5, 10, 20) to minimize random noise and avoid overfitting.
  •  **Risk neutralization:**  Lower Alpha volatility by controlling industry-related risks through Market/Sector/Industry/Subindustry neutralization, Slow/Fast/Slow + Fast/Crowding/Statistical/RAM factor risk neutralization, or by applying neutralization operators such as Group_neutralize, Vector_neut, and Regression_neut.
  •  **Managing data irregularities:**  Handle missing values using operators like ts_backfill and group_backfill, while reducing noise with smoothing operators such as ts_mean and ts_decay_linear.
  •  **Outlier control:**  Control outliers using winsorize, truncate operators, or the truncation parameter in simulation settings to avoid excessive position concentration on individual stocks.

Ensures your Alpha's Sharpe stays strong across the  *entire*  IS period (not just overall). Tests rolling 2–10 year windows. Fails if any window drops below threshold. Lower turnover (<30%) makes pass threshold easier (×0.85). Build robust Alphas with proper neutralization, backfilling, smoothing, and outlier control.

IS-Ladder seems less about one impressive Sharpe and more about consistency across windows. For me, the key is combining logical intuition, stable parameters, controlled turnover, and robustness checks before trusting any alpha.

A sharp post indeed!

Good explanation. I think the key point of IS-Ladder is that it punishes “one lucky period” alphas. A strong full-period Sharpe is not enough if the recent 2-year or 3-year window is weak.
