### 评论 #19 (作者: YZ51589, 时间: 3个月前)

For me, the biggest shift wasn’t the tooling — it was the mindset. On a single machine, you can get away with loosely structured experiments. Once you move to distributed compute, every ambiguity becomes expensive. Reproducibility stops being a “nice to have” and becomes survival.

What helped most was enforcing strict versioning on  *everything*  — data snapshots, feature definitions, and parameter configs. If I can’t recreate a backtest result exactly weeks later, scaling just amplifies chaos.

On partitioning, I’ve found that aligning partitions with how features are consumed (usually time-based for backtests) reduces friction more than trying to optimize purely for compute balance. And keeping pipelines idempotent — so reruns don’t mutate state — saved a lot of debugging pain.

In short, distributed research rewards discipline far more than hardware.

To scale research from single-machine experiments to distributed compute, use modular pipelines, versioned datasets, and reproducible configurations. Partition data by time or universe for parallel processing. Automate workflows with orchestration tools and maintain consistent environments. Logging results and parameter tracking ensures experiments remain comparable, scalable, and easy to reproduce across distributed systems.
