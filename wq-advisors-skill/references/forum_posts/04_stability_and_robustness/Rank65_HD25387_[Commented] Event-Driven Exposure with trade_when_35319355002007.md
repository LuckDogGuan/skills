I used  `trade_when`  to focus only around earnings releases. Sharpe improved, but turnover collapsed. It seems precision trades off with exposure.
👉 Do you accept low-turnover event alphas, or do you adapt them to raise trading frequency?

Great question. Event-driven alphas often have this trade-off: higher precision but lower turnover. In many cases, low-turnover signals are still valuable as long as they remain robust and scalable. Some people adapt them by layering with higher-frequency signals, while others keep them as pure event alphas and let them complement the portfolio. Both approaches can work depending on how you balance exposure and stability.

Event-driven signals often trade precision for lower turnover. They can still be valuable as stand-alone alphas if robust, or combined with broader signals to balance exposure depending on portfolio needs.

Event-driven signals typically offer strong precision but come with naturally lower turnover. They can still be effective on their own when they’re robust, or they can be paired with broader, continuous signals to create a more balanced exposure depending on the portfolio’s objectives.

Event-driven alphas often come with a clear trade-off between precision and turnover. These signals are typically triggered by discrete events, which means they do not fire frequently, resulting in naturally lower turnover. However, low turnover does not imply low value. As long as the signal is robust, scalable, and economically sound, it can still play an important role in a diversified portfolio. In practice, there are two common ways researchers handle this. Some choose to keep event-driven alphas pure, allowing them to act as stabilizing components that complement more continuous signals. Others layer them with higher-frequency or broader signals to improve capital utilization and smooth exposure over time. Both approaches can be effective, depending on portfolio objectives, risk tolerance, and correlation constraints. The key is to evaluate how the event-driven alpha contributes to overall stability, diversification, and performance rather than judging it solely by turnover metrics.

How do you decide whether to keep an event-driven alpha standalone or blend it with higher-frequency signals?

Event-driven alpha strategies often involve a natural balance between accuracy and trading frequency. Because these signals are activated by specific events, they tend to appear infrequently, which leads to lower turnover by design. However, limited activity does not reduce their potential usefulness. When an event-driven signal is well validated, scalable, and supported by sound economic reasoning, it can add meaningful value to a diversified portfolio. In practice, researchers usually follow one of two paths. Some prefer to preserve the purity of event-driven alphas, using them as low-frequency anchors that enhance portfolio stability alongside more continuous signals. Others integrate them with higher-frequency or broader alphas to improve capital efficiency and maintain smoother exposure over time. Both methods can work, depending on portfolio goals, risk preferences, and correlation limits. Ultimately, the focus should be on how the signal improves diversification, stability, and overall performance, rather than evaluating it purely through turnover.

I’m generally okay with low-turnover event alphas  *if*  they add clear diversification. I don’t try to force frequency unless the signal clearly generalizes outside the event window.
