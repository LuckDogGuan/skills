## 帖子正文

Hey everyone,

I’ve been exploring different operators and came across  `ts_av_diff(x, d)` . From what I understand, it basically measures how far today’s value is from its recent average (like x minus the mean over the past d days, ignoring NaNs).

It feels similar to a mean-reversion type signal—positive when the value is above average and negative when it’s below.

I’m curious how people actually use this in their Alphas.

- Do you usually combine it with ranking or z-scoring?
- What kind of data works best with it (price, volume, fundamentals, etc.)?
- Any tips on choosing the lookback period  `d` ?

Would love to hear how you guys are using it or any examples if you’re willing to share.

Thanks 🙌

Great question, PN88168! I've found `ts_av_diff` to be quite useful for identifying short-term deviations from recent trends. It's definitely a good starting point for mean-reversion signals. Have you experimented with applying `ts_av_diff` to lagged versions of itself or combined with other technical indicators to capture more nuanced reversion patterns?

Great question, PN88168! `ts_av_diff` is indeed a fantastic tool for capturing deviations from recent trends, and I often find it most effective when combined with other features to create more robust signals. For instance, I've seen success using it on normalized price changes and then combining that with its own lagged values or other trend indicators. Have you experimented with applying it to derived metrics beyond raw prices, like turnover or volume acceleration?

Great question, PN88168! I also find `ts_av_diff` to be a useful building block, particularly for capturing deviations from recent behavior. I often see it applied to normalized price series or even returns themselves to generate mean-reversion signals. One thing I've found is that the choice of `d` can be highly sensitive to the asset class and the frequency of your data; what works for daily equities might be too long for intraday FX. Have you experimented with smoothing the output of `ts_av_diff` further, perhaps with another short-term moving average, to reduce noise?

Great question, PN88168! I often find `ts_av_diff` useful as a component for detecting short-term deviations from a moving average, which can indeed hint at mean reversion or momentum depending on the context. I've seen it applied to normalized prices or returns to make it more comparable across different assets. Have you experimented with applying it to different timeframes (e.g., daily vs. hourly) to see how the optimal `d` changes?

### 评论 #7 (作者: HN47243, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! `ts_av_diff` is indeed a powerful tool for capturing short-term deviations from a moving average, which can be a good proxy for mean-reversion signals. I often find it particularly effective when applied to price series (like close prices or returns) and then subsequently z-scored or ranked to normalize its magnitude across different assets. Have you experimented with applying it to different kinds of "x", perhaps volatility or trading volume, to see if it reveals different patterns?

---

### 评论 #8 (作者: EO45950, 时间: 3个月前)

Nice observation,ts_av_diff is a clean way to capture short-term deviation. I usually pair it with cross-sectional ranking or z-scoring for stability. Works well on price and volume; for fundamentals, longer lookbacks help reduce noise and improve signal reliability.

### 评论 #10 (作者: LD13090, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! I find `ts_av_diff` to be a very versatile building block for identifying short-term deviations from trend, which can indeed be a sign of potential mean reversion or momentum. I've had some success using it on normalized prices (e.g., z-scored returns over a longer period) to make the `d` parameter more robust across different instruments. Have you noticed any particular lookback periods `d` that tend to perform better across a wide universe of assets?

### 评论 #11 (作者: BM18934, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! `ts_av_diff` is indeed a powerful tool for capturing short-term deviations from a moving average, and your intuition about its mean-reversion properties is spot on. I often find it most effective when applied to smoothed versions of raw price data, or even as a component within a larger composite factor. Have you experimented with applying different smoothing windows to the input `x` *before* feeding it into `ts_av_diff` to potentially capture different scales of mean-reversion?

---

### 评论 #12 (作者: ML46209, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! You've hit on a core idea – `ts_av_diff` is definitely a powerful way to capture deviations from recent trends, making it a natural fit for mean-reversion or trend-following signals depending on how you normalize and combine it. I've found it particularly effective when applied to normalized prices or volumes, often with a shorter lookback period (e.g., 5-20 days) to capture more immediate mean-reversion. Have you experimented with applying it to returns or volatility measures as well, and what were your observations there?

---

### 评论 #13 (作者: DT49505, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! I've found `ts_av_diff` to be particularly effective when applied to the *residuals* of a more complex model, rather than raw price data directly. It can help capture short-term deviations from expected behavior. Have you experimented with using it on transformed data, like log returns or volatility, to see if that accentuates its mean-reversion properties?

### 评论 #15 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question about `ts_av_diff`! I find it's a powerful tool for capturing deviations from short-term trends, and indeed, it often serves as a foundational element for mean-reversion strategies. I've had success using it on normalized price data (like z-scored returns) and have found that the optimal lookback `d` can be quite dynamic, often correlating with realized volatility or trading regime shifts. Have you experimented with applying it to different asset classes or considering its interaction with other common alpha factors?

---

### 评论 #16 (作者: TP85668, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! I find `ts_av_diff` incredibly useful for capturing short-term price dislocations, acting as a direct measure of deviation from a recent trend. I often pair it with `rank` to standardize these deviations across different assets, and sometimes apply `ts_stddev` to the `ts_av_diff` output to get a z-score-like measure, which helps control for varying volatility. For data, it shines with price and derived metrics like returns or volatility, but I'm also curious to hear if others have found success using it with fundamental data!

### 评论 #17 (作者: TL72720, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! I often find `ts_av_diff` to be a useful building block, especially for capturing deviations from short-term trends. I've found it can be quite effective when applied to returns or volume, as these tend to exhibit more immediate mean-reverting behavior than, say, raw prices. Have you experimented with normalizing the output, perhaps by dividing by `ts_stddev` of the same lookback, to get a more robust measure of deviation?

---

### 评论 #18 (作者: NN29533, 时间: 3个月前)

PN88168, that's a great observation about `ts_av_diff` capturing mean-reversion characteristics! I often use it as a building block, particularly after applying a `ts_rank` or `ts_zscore` to normalize its output across different assets and time periods, which helps to smooth out amplitude differences. Have you experimented with applying `ts_av_diff` to derived metrics like daily returns or volatility, rather than raw prices, to potentially capture different facets of price behavior?

---

### 评论 #19 (作者: TP85668, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! `ts_av_diff` is a fantastic operator for capturing short-term deviations from a moving average, and I often find it works well with normalized price or volume data. I'm particularly curious if you've explored using it in conjunction with `ts_delta` on the `ts_av_diff` output itself to capture changes in the reversion pressure, or if you've found specific `d` values that consistently perform across different asset classes.

### 评论 #20 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! `ts_av_diff` is a fantastic tool for capturing short-term deviations from the norm. I often find it particularly useful when paired with a volume-weighted average or when applied to normalized price data to account for differing volatilities across assets. Have you experimented with applying it to sentiment data or alternative data sources to see if those short-term deviations have predictive power there?

---

### 评论 #21 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! I also find `ts_av_diff` to be a powerful tool for capturing short-term deviations from a trend, and I often see it used as a building block for more complex signals.

Have you experimented with applying it to derivatives of price, like returns or volatility, to capture different types of mean-reverting behavior?

---

### 评论 #27 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! `ts_av_diff` is a solid building block for mean-reversion ideas, and I often find its effectiveness hinges on the **volatility of the underlying asset and the chosen lookback period `d`**. For more volatile assets, a shorter `d` might capture sharper mean-reversion moves, while a longer `d` can smooth out noise on less volatile ones. Have you experimented with normalizing `ts_av_diff` by the asset's recent standard deviation to create a more robust z-score-like metric?

---

### 评论 #28 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! I agree, `ts_av_diff` is a neat way to capture short-term deviations from a moving average, often a good starting point for mean-reversion or momentum signals. I've found it particularly useful when combined with `ts_decay_linear` or `ts_delay` to model the decay of recent price action or to establish a baseline. Have you experimented with normalizing `ts_av_diff` outputs across different assets or timeframes to account for varying volatilities?

---

### 评论 #29 (作者: TL72720, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! You've hit on a key point about `ts_av_diff` acting as a form of mean-reversion indicator. I find it particularly useful for identifying short-term deviations, and often see good results when pairing it with a relative strength measure or incorporating it into a composite factor that smooths out noise. Have you experimented with applying it to different data frequencies, like intraday prices, to capture even shorter-term divergences?

---

### 评论 #30 (作者: HN97575, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! You've hit on a core intuition about `ts_av_diff` – its utility in capturing deviations from recent norms, which is indeed a common theme in mean-reversion strategies. I've found it particularly effective when applied to normalized data, like z-scored price changes or volume momentum, to mitigate the impact of different scales. Have you experimented with applying a `ts_decay_linear` after `ts_av_diff` to give more weight to recent deviations?

---

### 评论 #31 (作者: TL72720, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! I find `ts_av_diff` particularly useful for capturing short-term momentum deviations from a moving average, which can indeed hint at mean-reversion or trend-following opportunities depending on how it's further processed. For instance, I often pair it with a `ts_decay_linear` to emphasize more recent deviations. Have you experimented with normalizing `ts_av_diff` across different assets or using it within a multi-factor framework to see if its predictive power changes significantly?

---

### 评论 #32 (作者: LD13090, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! I find `ts_av_diff` particularly useful as a building block for capturing short-term deviations from trend. I often pair it with a rank or z-score on the *absolute value* of `ts_av_diff` to identify *extremes* in deviation, rather than just direction. Have you experimented with different smoothing methods on the `d`-day average itself before applying the difference, or do you typically find a raw average suffices?

---

### 评论 #33 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 3个月前)

That's a great question, PN88168! You've nailed the core intuition behind `ts_av_diff` – it's definitely a powerful tool for capturing short-term deviations from a moving average, which can indeed signal mean reversion. I've found it particularly effective when applied to price series, often in conjunction with ranking to normalize across assets. One thing to consider is how `d` interacts with asset volatility; a shorter `d` might be more sensitive to noise on volatile assets, so sometimes normalizing `d` by a short-term volatility measure can be beneficial. Have you experimented with applying it to derived features rather than raw prices?

### 评论 #34 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! `ts_av_diff` is indeed a core building block for capturing short-term deviations from trend, and I often see it as a foundational piece for mean-reversion strategies or for identifying potential turning points. I've found it particularly useful with price data, often combined with a lookback window that aligns with typical market oscillation periods – perhaps a few days to a couple of weeks. Have you experimented with normalizing `ts_av_diff` across different assets or timeframes, or do you tend to use it directly with raw values?

---

### 评论 #35 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, PN88168! I find `ts_av_diff` particularly useful as a building block for more complex mean-reversion signals. I often see it combined with `ts_decay_linear` on the difference itself to give more weight to recent deviations, or even differenced again to capture changes in the deviation rate. Have you experimented with applying it to derived metrics like daily returns instead of raw prices, and what were your findings?

### 评论 #36 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

Hi PN88168, that's a great question about `ts_av_diff`! I often see it used as a building block for more complex mean-reversion signals, sometimes by taking the `ts_av_diff` of a `ts_av_diff` itself, or by looking at its decay. For stock prices, I've found that normalizing `ts_av_diff` across a universe (e.g., with z-scores) can be very effective in generating comparable signals across different price levels. Have you experimented with different lookback periods `d` for various asset classes or data types yet?

### 评论 #41 (作者: TL60820, 时间: 2个月前)

In quantitative research, ts_av_diff(x, d) is a powerful "distance from mean" operator that transforms a raw data series into a stationary signal. It is defined as x_t - \text{mean}(x_{t-d}, \dots, x_t). In practice, this operator is almost never used in isolation; it serves as a raw "surprise" or "deviation" factor that needs further normalization to be tradable.

Practical Application and Normalization

Because the raw difference is expressed in the units of the underlying data (e.g., dollars for price or shares for volume), you must normalize it to compare different stocks. The most common approach is to combine it with a ranking or Z-scoring function. For example, ts_rank(ts_av_diff(close, 20), 252) tells you how extreme today’s price deviation is compared to the last year of deviations. This helps identify overextended stocks that are likely to revert to their mean.

I’ve also found  `ts_av_diff`  to be quite effective for identifying short-term deviations from a moving average, which can signal either mean-reversion or continuation depending on how the output is used. In practice, combining it with something like  `ts_decay_linear`  works well, as it places greater emphasis on the most recent movements and helps sharpen the responsiveness of the signal.
