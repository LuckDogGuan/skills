## 帖子正文

## **1. Competition Parameters**

- **Window:**  March 16, 2026 – March 29, 2026 (14-day duration).
- **Incentive Structure:**   **1X Multiplier**  applied to regular Power Pool Alphas.
- **Eligibility:**  Only submissions adhering strictly to the thematic technical requirements will qualify for the prize pool.

## **2. Technical Configuration Requirements**

To ensure compliance, all alpha submissions must be configured with the following parameters:

- **Neutralization:**  Must utilize  **"Fast Factors."**
- **Lead-lag Settings:**  Strictly set to  **Delay 1 (D1).**
- **Objective:**  These constraints target high-frequency signal components that remain robust after removing common fast-factor exposures.

## **3. Regional Dataset Restrictions**

Special constraints apply to the  **Korea (KOR)**  and  **India (IND)**  regions to maintain data integrity:

- **Restricted Set:**  Use of the  **"PV1"**  dataset is prohibited for primary signal generation.
- **Permitted Usage:**  "PV1" fields are allowed only as  **support fields**  (e.g., for normalization or filtering) but cannot be the alpha's core logic.

Interesting challenge focusing on robust, high-frequency signals. The "Fast Factors" neutralization and D1 lead-lag are smart constraints to isolate truly alpha-generating components. I'm curious about the rationale behind restricting PV1 for KOR/IND primary generation – is this to prevent overfitting on specific regional data dynamics, or something else?

Since kor and amr does not have fast neutralisation then how can we make  power pool alpha in these regions ?

**On Fast Factors neutralization as the mandatory scheme:**

This constraint is actually a useful forcing function. It pushes you away from short-term price momentum and reversal signals that would get neutralized away anyway, and toward signals with genuine information content beyond what fast systematic factors already capture. If your alpha relies heavily on recent price action it won't survive this neutralization meaningfully — so the constraint self-selects for more fundamentally grounded or alternative data driven ideas.

The upside is that surviving Fast Factors neutralization is a reasonable quality signal in itself. Alphas that pass this screen tend to have better OOS stability because they're not just fast factor proxies in disguise.

This is a compelling challenge centered on building robust, high-frequency signals. The use of “Fast Factors” neutralization alongside D1 lead-lag constraints is a thoughtful way to isolate alpha-generating components genuinely while minimizing noise and unintended exposures.

This is a really interesting challenge focusing on D1 lead-lag and "Fast Factors" neutralization. I'm curious about the rationale behind explicitly prohibiting "PV1" for core logic in KOR/IND – is this to prevent overfitting to specific, potentially noisy, high-frequency intraday patterns in those markets, or are there other considerations? Looking forward to seeing how people adapt their alphas.

Building on KP26017's point about surviving the neutralization scheme, the real technical friction here is pairing that with the D1 requirement. D1 inherently pushes us toward short-term inefficiencies, which usually drives up turnover. If standard momentum and reversal are neutralized away, finding a high-frequency edge that doesn't just decay instantly Out-of-Sample (OS) is a tight needle to thread. Has anyone found a reliable way to constrain turnover on D1 signals when the standard price-volume safety nets are removed?

**You have roughly 10 days left as of today so time allocation matters:**

Don't spend the first week perfecting one alpha and rush the remaining four submissions in the final days. The correlation requirement means your submissions need to be evaluated as a portfolio — you need breathing room to check cross-submission correlation after each one and adjust course if you're clustering too tightly around similar ideas.

Rough pacing that works: aim to have your first two submissions in by day 4-5, check their production correlation against each other, then use that information to deliberately steer submissions 3-5 into genuinely different factor spaces.

On Fast Factors neutralization as a required scheme:

This constraint is actually helpful—it steers you away from short-term price-based signals that would be neutralized anyway, and toward ideas with real informational edge beyond fast systematic factors. If an alpha depends too much on recent price action, it likely won’t hold up under this framework.

The benefit is that passing Fast Factors neutralization becomes a quality filter itself—alphas that survive tend to be more robust and show better out-of-sample stability, since they’re not just proxies for fast factors.

This is an interesting challenge, focusing on isolating pure high-frequency alpha. The "Fast Factors" neutralization with D1 lead-lag settings suggests a deep dive into very short-term dynamics, which could be exciting for uncovering novel signals. I'm curious about the rationale behind restricting "PV1" in KOR and IND for primary generation – is this to mitigate potential look-ahead bias or specific data quirks in those markets?

---

### 评论 #10 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting challenge! The "Fast Factors" neutralization and D1 lead-lag settings definitely point towards exploring very short-term dynamics. I'm curious, for those considering the PV1 restrictions in KOR/IND, are there specific alternative datasets or combinations you're finding effective for core signal generation in those markets?

---

### 评论 #11 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting challenge focusing on fast, short-horizon signals. The D1 lead-lag and "Fast Factors" neutralization really push towards intraday dynamics. Curious if anyone has explored how specific "PV1" fields, even as support, might inadvertently introduce longer-term biases in KOR/IND despite the restrictions.

### 评论 #12 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting focus on fast factors and D1 lag for this Power Pool challenge! It sounds like the aim is to isolate alpha that's truly predictive in the very short term, rather than relying on longer-term relationships. I'm curious if anyone has found "Fast Factors" to be particularly effective in capturing alpha within the KOR and IND markets, especially given the PV1 restriction.

---

### 评论 #13 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting challenge focusing on short-term signal robustness! The "Fast Factors" and D1 lead-lag constraints definitely point towards capturing very granular alpha. I'm curious to hear how others are approaching the PV1 dataset restriction for KOR/IND – is it mainly for feature engineering, or are there specific normalization techniques you're finding effective?

### 评论 #14 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great deep dive into the March 2026 Power Pool challenge parameters! The focus on "Fast Factors" and D1 lead-lag settings definitely points towards exploring short-horizon, robust signal dynamics. I'm curious about the rationale behind restricting "PV1" for primary signal generation in KOR/IND – is this to mitigate potential overfitting concerns or to encourage the use of alternative data sources in those specific markets?

---

### 评论 #15 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a great breakdown of the March 2026 Power Pool challenge! The emphasis on "Fast Factors" and D1 lead-lag settings really hones in on capturing short-term alpha. I'm curious about the rationale behind prohibiting "PV1" for primary signal generation in KOR/IND – is it primarily to avoid overfitting to specific recent dynamics in those markets, or are there other considerations? Looking forward to seeing how people navigate these constraints.
