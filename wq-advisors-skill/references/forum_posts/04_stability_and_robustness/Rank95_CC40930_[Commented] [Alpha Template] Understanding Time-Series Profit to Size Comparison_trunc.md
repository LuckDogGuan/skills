Hi Community,

Below is a simple template implementation comparing a company's profitability to its capitalization.

The hypothesis is that if a performance ratio of the fundamentals of a company is increasing compared to earlier, stock price may increase.

> [time_series_operator](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/data-and-operators/operators#time-series-operators) (<profit_field>/<size_field>, <days>)

Implementation:

- Use time series operators and a ratio of two fundamental metrics
- The profit_field is any field that represents income/earrings/profit
- The size_field is any field that represents the size of the company
- Use reasonable day parameter, such as week(5 days), month(20 days), quarter(60 days) or year(250 days)

✨Can you think of different ways to expand this template? Comment below to share your idea!

To expand this Alpha template, you can consider the putting the profit_field and size_field through goup_rank operator first. This controls the industry affect, which may lead to improved performance! Remember to add one to the divisor, to avoid generating extreme value from dividing close to zero value.

Expanded template:

> [time_series_operator](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/data-and-operators/operators#time-series-operators) (group_rank(<profit_field>, <group>)/ (group_rank(<size_field>, <group>) + 1), <days>)

Hi. I would like to ask what is the maximum simulate tab? Currently, I can only simulate up to 10 regular tabs in parallel. Is it possible to simulate 10 multi sim tabs in parallel and in each multi sim tab there are 10 regular sims? (total of 100 parallel simulations). Thank you.

I am not sure what maximum simulate tab you are referring to. For multi-simulations, it is possible to go up to 10 x 10 simulations.

Thank you for sharing this insightful and practical template! The combination of profitability and capitalization offers a clear framework for identifying growth opportunities. Your explanation makes it easy to understand how time-series operators can reveal trends. I truly appreciate your effort in simplifying complex concepts for better application.

Hey, YW42946! That's a cool template indeed. One way to expand it could be to introduce different weighting schemes for the time series operator, like exponential weighting instead of simple averaging. Another idea is to incorporate sector or industry classifications, comparing the ratio within specific sectors first and then across the whole market. Also, we might consider adding some filters based on volatility of the profit_field or size_field to make the comparison more refined. Just some thoughts to share with you.

By applying the  **group_rank**  operator to both the  **profit_field**  and  **size_field** , you're effectively controlling for industry effects, which is an important step in reducing potential biases and improving the alpha model's robustness. Let me break down the expanded template for clarity:

### Expanded Template Breakdown:

1. **Group Ranking the Profit Field** :
   - **`group_rank(<profit_field>, <group>)`** : This will rank the  **profit_field**  (e.g., profit margin, earnings growth, etc.) within each group. The  **group**  refers to a grouping criterion, which could be the industry, sector, or other relevant factor.
   - By applying the  **group_rank**  to the profit field, you ensure that the stock’s performance is compared against its industry peers, reducing the influence of broader market movements and better capturing relative performance within each group.
2. **Group Ranking the Size Field** :
   - **`group_rank(<size_field>, <group>)`** : Similarly, this ranks the  **size_field**  (e.g., market capitalization, assets, etc.) within each group (industry, sector, etc.).
   - This helps to control for the size effect within each group, ensuring that size differences across industries do not overly influence the performance of your alpha model.
3. **Dividing the Group-Ranked Profit by the Group-Ranked Size** :
   - **`group_rank(<profit_field>, <group>) / (group_rank(<size_field>, <group>) + 1)`** : This ratio now compares the relative performance of a stock’s profitability against its size, after controlling for industry effects. The  **+1**  in the denominator helps to prevent division by small numbers or zero, ensuring stability in the calculation and avoiding extreme values that can distort the results.
4. **Time-Series Operator** :
   - The final step applies a  **time-series operator**  to this ratio over a given number of days (e.g., 252 days for a yearly period). This operator smooths out short-term fluctuations and provides a more stable signal over time.
   - **`time_series_operator(..., <days>)`** : The time-series operator can be any relevant function, such as  **mean** ,  **sum** , or  **rolling average** , applied to this ratio over the specified  **<days>**  period.

### Key Benefits of This Approach:

- **Industry Control** : By ranking both the profit and size fields within their respective industries, you're controlling for sector-based or industry-based effects, which could otherwise distort the alpha signal.
- **Stability** : The addition of  **+1**  in the denominator avoids potential issues with small or zero values in the size field, ensuring that the signal remains stable and less prone to extreme values.
- **Improved Signal Precision** : By focusing on the relative performance of stocks within industries, this approach should produce a more refined and robust alpha signal, potentially leading to improved performance and better risk-adjusted returns.

### Final Template (Expanded):

`time_series_operator(group_rank(<profit_field>, <group>) / (group_rank(<size_field>, <group>) + 1), <days>)
`

This expansion should definitely enhance the alpha template, making it more adaptable and likely to produce better results.

**Hey, great ideas shared by everyone! Another way to expand the template could be to introduce momentum factors related to the profit_field or size_field. For example, calculate the momentum of profit growth over a certain period and incorporate it into the ratio. Also, we could consider using different time lags for the time series operator to capture delayed effects. That might give us a more comprehensive view and potentially improve the performance of our alpha model.**

**Template Expansion** : The original template can be expanded by applying the  `group_rank`  operator to both the profit and size fields to control for industry effects, which may enhance the alpha's performance.
 **Different Weighting Schemes** : Introducing exponential weighting to the time series operator could provide a more nuanced view of the data, emphasizing more recent performance.
 **Incorporating Momentum Factors** : Adding momentum factors related to the profit or size fields and considering different time lags for the time series operator can offer a more comprehensive view, potentially improving the alpha model's performance.

This template is a great starting point for analyzing profitability vs. capitalization. A potential expansion could involve adjusting for sector-specific performance by normalizing the ratios across different industries. Additionally, incorporating growth rates for profitability and size might offer deeper insights into a company's potential for future performance. Looking forward to further discussions on improving this approach!
