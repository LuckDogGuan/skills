I am having difficulty understand these operators and hence unable to create an alpha using these operators, can someone explain please how to create an alpha with vector_proj and group_vector_neut operator

This is a very good question because both  *vector_proj*  and  *group_vector_neut*  can be confusing at first glance, yet they are quite powerful when applied correctly.  *Vector_proj(x, y)*  is essentially projecting one vector onto another—think of it as decomposing the variation in  *x*  that aligns with  *y* . In practice, this allows you to isolate the component of your signal that is correlated with a known factor, or conversely, to strip it out by subtracting the projection. On the other hand,  *group_vector_neut*  generalizes this concept to cross-sectional groups: it neutralizes your signal relative to group-defined vectors (like industry or sector). For example, if you have a momentum alpha that is unintentionally overweight in tech stocks, applying  *group_vector_neut(alpha, sector, benchmark_vector)*  will help remove sector-driven bias while keeping stock-specific information. A practical way to start is to combine your base alpha with  *vector_proj*  against a benchmark factor (say, market beta), then test stability before applying group-level neutralization. This workflow helps ensure your signal is not simply re-expressing common risk exposures but rather capturing unique predictive content.

Thank you for raising this question about  *vector_proj*  and  *group_vector_neut* . These operators are not as widely discussed as the more common ones, so it’s very helpful that you asked for clarification—it gives the community a chance to share knowledge. I appreciate that you admitted your difficulty directly; it makes the discussion more approachable for others who may be wondering the same thing but hesitate to ask. Posts like yours are important because they highlight advanced tools that can expand our alpha design toolkit beyond the basics. Even if they seem technical at first, once understood, they allow us to build cleaner, more diversified, and more robust signals. I’m grateful you brought this up because it sparks a conversation that benefits both newer and more experienced consultants. Thanks again for your openness—it’s the kind of question that pushes the community forward.

vector_proj lets you measure how much of one vector (your signal) aligns with another vector (often a risk or style factor). For example, you can project your alpha onto a market-cap vector to see whether your signal is mostly just picking up size exposure. Using vector_proj(alpha, cap) would essentially tell you the “size-driven” part of your alpha.
group_vector_neut is then the “cleaner.” It neutralizes your vector within groups such as industry or country, removing shared structure so your alpha becomes less biased. For instance, group_vector_neut(alpha, industry, cap) would neutralize your alpha’s exposure to size within each industry.

Thanks for asking about vector_proj and group_vector_neut. Highlighting these less-discussed operators helps the community learn advanced tools, enabling cleaner, more diversified, and robust alphas while encouraging open discussion and shared insights.

Hey,

Both  ***vector_proj***  and  ***group_vector_neut***  may look tricky at first, but when used well, they’re really powerful tools.  ***vector_proj(x, y)***  is about projecting one vector onto another—it’s like extracting from  **x**  the portion of its variation that is aligned with  **y** . In real-world use, this lets you pull out the part of your signal that’s tied to a known factor, or to get rid of that part by subtracting the projection.

By contrast,  *group_vector_neut*  applies this same kind of idea, but across groups in a cross-sectional setting. So instead of neutralizing your signal against a single vector uniformly, you neutralize relative to vectors defined by groups (for example, sector, industry, region). Suppose your alpha/momentum signal is unintentionally skewed toward tech stocks—that’s a sector bias. If you apply  *group_vector_neut(alpha, sector, benchmark_vector),* you’ll reduce or remove that sector-level tilt, while preserving the stock-specific (idiosyncratic) parts.

A useful way to work with both is: start with your base signal, project it against a broad benchmark factor (e.g., market beta) using  *vector_proj*  to see or remove the exposure; then test whether the remaining signal still behaves stably / has predictive value; afterward, use  *group_vector_neut*  to eliminate group biases (such as sector, industry, etc.). This ensures you’re not just replicating common risk factors, but rather isolating something uniquely predictive.

Cheers!

Creating alphas with  `vector_proj`  and  `group_vector_neut`  can feel complex, but here’s a simple breakdown.  `vector_proj(x, y)`  projects signal  `x`  onto signal  `y` , capturing how much  `x`  aligns with the direction of  `y` . For example, projecting price change onto volume change helps isolate directional influence:  `alpha = vector_proj(delta(close, 1), delta(volume, 1))`

`group_vector_neut(x, group_id)`  removes group-level bias from a signal—like sector or country effects. If your signal favors tech stocks, neutralizing by sector balances it:  `alpha = group_vector_neut(rank(delta(close, 1)), sector)`

To combine both:  `alpha = group_vector_neut(vector_proj(delta(close, 1), delta(volume, 1)), sector)`

This gives a sector-neutral signal showing how price change aligns with volume change. Start simple, test each operator separately, then combine. These tools help build robust, diversified alphas by isolating meaningful relationships and removing structural bias.

Absolutely! Operators like  `vector_proj`  and  `group_vector_neut`  are often underutilized but can be game-changers.  `vector_proj`  helps isolate directional exposure relative to a benchmark or factor, while  `group_vector_neut`  efficiently neutralizes signals within groups (like sectors or countries) without over-neutralizing globally. Together, they allow for more controlled, diversified alphas and cleaner signal extraction. Sharing experiences with these operators is great—it spreads practical know-how and helps others design more robust, production-ready alphas.
