## Overview

A common experience in WorldQuant BRAIN:

> An alpha looks strong in backtest… but weakens after submission.

This isn’t random. It usually points to structural issues in how the alpha was built.

## Key Reasons

### 1. Overfitting to Historical Data

Small tweaks (decay, window, delay) can unintentionally fit noise instead of signal.
👉 The alpha performs well in-sample but lacks true predictive power.

### 2. Alpha Crowding

Many researchers explore similar ideas using the same data and operators.
👉 Your “unique” alpha may already exist in slightly different form.

### 3. Hidden Risk Exposures

Some alphas rely on unintended factors (e.g., sector bias, beta).
👉 Once adjusted or neutralized, performance drops.

### 4. Platform Optimization Bias

It’s easy to optimize for platform metrics (Sharpe, fitness) rather than real robustness.
👉 The result: alphas that pass filters but don’t generalize.

## 🧭 Key Insight

> A strong backtest does not guarantee a strong alpha.

The real test is whether the signal:

- survives parameter changes
- holds across delays
- remains stable after neutralization

## ❓ Discussion

- Have you seen alphas degrade after submission?
- How do you test robustness beyond standard metrics?

## ✍️ Takeaway

👉 The question isn’t “Does it work?”
👉 It’s “Will it still work when conditions change?”

Small changes to achieve greater IS stats usually do lead to overfitting easily.
