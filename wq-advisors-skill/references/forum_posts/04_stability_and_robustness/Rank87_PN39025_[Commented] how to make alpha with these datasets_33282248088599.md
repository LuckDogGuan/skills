Hi  [SG91420](/hc/en-us/profiles/4551722688535-SG91420)  , sentiment data can also be used for Alpha signals themselves, whether as an indicator of company performance, as event-driven Alpha or more, and I often use sentiment data in vector form, so nesting vector functions to reduce dimensionality into a matrix, then using operators like date since last change to capture the time of the trade.

if we talk about  Sentiment datasets usually include metrics like positive, negative and neutrals **scores** ,  **sentiment polarity** , and  **volume of mentions**  from news or analyst reports. AND Short interest often indicates  **bearish sentiment** . Extreme values might signal  **future reversals**  or  **continued pressure** .or last thing that Social signals are noisy, but often  **lead news sentiment**  and may capture  **retail investor mood** .

Sentiment, Short interest, and social media datasets offer powerful signals for short-term alpha. Positive sentiment or social buzz can drive momentum, while rising short interest may indicate bearish trends or squeeze potential. Focus on timely, high-impact changes in these datasets to build effective, high-turnover strategies.

To generate alpha using sentiment, short interest, and social media data on the WorldQuant platform, you can combine these signals into ranked, normalized expressions. For example, rising sentiment can be used for momentum alphas, while extreme bullish sentiment combined with strong recent returns may signal mean reversion. High short interest paired with a spike in social media mentions can indicate short-squeeze potential.

Nice question You can make alpha using these datasets by looking at how people feel about stocks in news or on social media. If most people are saying good things, the stock might go up. Short interest shows how many people are betting the stock will fall. If many are shorting, and suddenly people start saying good things online, the stock might rise fast (a short squeeze). You can create signals using changes in sentiment, short interest, or social media activity. Try your ideas on different stocks and times to see what works best. Keep testing and improving your strategy.

it seems hard, I tried sentiment using bucket to make it as a group datafied, but it seems hard to be a unique factor, and it has very limited datafields.

Sentiment, short interest, and social media datasets are all event- and behavior-driven sources that can be powerful when used correctly, especially in shorter-horizon alphas. For sentiment data, you can test both aggregate market sentiment shifts and cross-sectional sentiment divergence — e.g., going long on assets with sharply improving sentiment while shorting those with rapid sentiment deterioration. Short interest is often predictive when combined with price action; for instance, rising short interest alongside falling prices may signal further downside momentum, while falling short interest after a squeeze can indicate mean reversion. Social media datasets can be noisy, so applying smoothing operators or filtering by engagement quality (likes, shares, verified accounts) can improve signal stability. Combining these sources can work well — for example, confirming a sentiment shift with matching social media buzz, or checking whether short interest changes align with online chatter volume. Always validate across multiple universes to avoid dataset-specific overfitting.

Extracting alpha from sentiment, short interest, and social media data usually works best when you  **combine signal design with careful noise control** . Sentiment and social media data are naturally high-frequency and volatile, so smoothing methods like  **ts_mean, decay_linear, or EWMA**  can help reduce noise while still capturing momentum shifts. Short interest tends to reflect positioning pressure, so fields like short_interest_ratio or changes in borrow cost can be powerful if you align them with liquidity or volume metrics to identify squeeze dynamics. Social media chatter is tricky — raw counts may correlate with volatility more than returns, so transforming into  **surprise metrics (e.g., today vs. rolling baseline)**  or ranking across peers often improves robustness.
