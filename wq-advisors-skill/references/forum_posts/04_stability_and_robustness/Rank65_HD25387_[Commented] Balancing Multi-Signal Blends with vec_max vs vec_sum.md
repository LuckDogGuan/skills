While experimenting with combining signals, I often defaulted to  `vec_sum`  since it aggregates information across datasets. But recently, I compared it against  `vec_max` , which only takes the strongest signal at any point in time. The results were surprising —  `vec_sum`  gave smoother PnL curves but often diluted the impact of strong sub-signals, while  `vec_max`  produced sharper movements and higher turnover but sometimes uncovered edges that would otherwise be averaged away. In one case, a  `vec_max`  blend of two weak signals even passed Semi-OS, while their sum did not. It reminded me that the method of combination is just as important as the signals themselves.

👉 Do you prefer summing signals for balance, or using max/min operators to highlight stronger edges?

Really interesting comparison 🔎. I’ve also noticed that vec_sum gives stability but can wash out sharper edges, while vec_max uncovers hidden bursts of alpha at the cost of turnover.
I think the choice often depends on the target use-case — smoother portfolio vs. hunting niche edges. Curious to hear more community takes on this! 🚀

That’s a fascinating observation — the trade-off between vec_sum and vec_max really highlights how signal combination can shape behavior beyond just correlation. I’ve also noticed that vec_sum tends to smooth out volatility but sometimes hides localized strength, while vec_max can act like a selective amplifier, surfacing sharper opportunities. Personally, I like testing both approaches with decay applied — it helps balance responsiveness and stability. Great insight — this definitely deserves more experimentation!

That’s a really interesting insight — the contrast between vec_sum and vec_max shows how different combination methods can influence signal behavior far beyond simple correlation effects. I’ve seen vec_sum reduce volatility but occasionally bury localized strengths, whereas vec_max behaves more like a focused amplifier that highlights sharper opportunities. I usually experiment with both, especially with decay added, since it helps strike a balance between responsiveness and stability. Great observation — definitely worth exploring further!

I’ve seen the same differences.  ***vec_sum***  is great for creating a balanced, smoother signal, but it can hide strong edges when two signals behave differently.  ***vec_max***  is more aggressive and can reveal sharper patterns, though it often increases turnover and noise. I usually test both because the “best” method depends on how independent the signals are. If each signal has unique strength,  ***vec_max***  can work surprisingly well, but  ***vec_sum***  is safer for general stability.

Great observation. I agree that  ***`vec_sum`***  tends to produce more stable, diversified behavior but can dilute high-conviction signals, whereas  ***`vec_max`***  is better at surfacing concentrated bursts of alpha, often with the trade-off of higher turnover and volatility. The right choice really does come down to intent—whether the goal is a smoother, more scalable portfolio or selectively capturing niche, high-impact opportunities. It’s a helpful reminder that operator choice is as much about portfolio objectives as it is about raw signal strength, and it’ll be interesting to see how others are navigating that trade-off.

Interesting observation. I usually default to vec_sum for stability, but vec_max can definitely surface sharper edges when signals are orthogonal and timing matters.

This is a thoughtful observation, and the difference between vec_sum and vec_max really highlights how signal combination methods shape behavior in ways that go beyond simple correlation metrics. From my experience, vec_sum often produces smoother and more stable signals by averaging effects, but it can sometimes dilute strong localized opportunities. In contrast, vec_max acts more like a spotlight, amplifying the strongest component at any given time, which can reveal sharp alpha bursts but often comes with higher volatility and turnover. I usually test both approaches side by side, often layering in decay to balance responsiveness with stability. The “right” choice tends to depend heavily on the intended role of the signal—whether it’s meant to support a broad, steady portfolio or to target more niche, high-conviction opportunities. Exploring both methods provides useful insight into how signal structure impacts downstream performance.

In your research, have you found cases where vec_max outperformed vec_sum consistently after accounting for turnover and costs?

This is a perceptive point, and the contrast between vec_sum and vec_max clearly shows how combination techniques influence signal behavior beyond what correlation alone can explain. In my experience, vec_sum generally leads to smoother and more consistent signals because it blends effects across components, though this averaging can sometimes weaken strong, localized alpha opportunities. On the other hand, vec_max functions more like a highlight mechanism, selecting the strongest input at each moment. This can expose sharp alpha spikes, but it usually introduces greater volatility and higher turnover. I often evaluate both methods in parallel and apply decay to help manage the trade-off between responsiveness and stability. Ultimately, the better choice depends on the intended purpose of the signal—whether it is designed to contribute steady support to a broad portfolio or to capture more specialized, high-conviction situations. Testing both approaches offers valuable insight into how signal construction affects overall performance.

I prefer vec_sum for production-style alphas, but vec_max is surprisingly useful during discovery. If vec_max works OS, it often means one component is carrying real signal.
