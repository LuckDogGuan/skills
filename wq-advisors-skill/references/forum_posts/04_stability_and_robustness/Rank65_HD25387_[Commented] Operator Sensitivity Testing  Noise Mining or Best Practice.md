Sometimes tiny operator tweaks (e.g.,  `ts_mean`  →  `ts_median` , or window 60 → 61) change OS IC significantly. At first, I thought this was just noise. But systematically testing variations helped identify  **stable operator families** .

For example, momentum signals stayed strong across multiple lookbacks (40–80), while valuation ratios were extremely parameter-sensitive. This gave me confidence to prioritize robust operator families for production.

👉 Question: Do you run structured sensitivity tests on operators, or avoid them to prevent curve-fitting?

I think structured sensitivity testing is best practice rather than noise mining. It helps distinguish genuinely robust operator families from fragile ones that only work under narrow conditions. The key is to keep the tests controlled, so you learn about stability without drifting into overfitting.
