Early research often prioritizes high Sharpe or returns, but I’m starting to think moderate performance with clean behavior is more valuable. Do you ever discard strong single-universe alphas simply because they feel too fragile?

Absolutely—this is a common trade-off in alpha research. High Sharpe or return can be enticing, but if an alpha is  **fragile** , tied to a narrow universe, sensitive to decay/neutralization, or overly reliant on a few extreme days, it often fails when scaled or deployed. I frequently set aside strong single-universe alphas if they exhibit these traits, favoring  **moderate but stable signals**  that survive small parameter changes, stress tests, and cross-universe checks. Over time, a portfolio of robust, well-behaved alphas usually outperforms a few “perfect” but brittle ones, both in risk-adjusted returns and in practical deployability. Consistency and survivability often matter more than peak metrics in the long run.

Yes, fragility is a valid reason to discard high-performing alphas. I've killed several strong single-universe alphas that showed excessive parameter sensitivity or unexplainable performance spikes in specific periods. Clean, moderate alphas with stable rolling metrics and clear economic intuition tend to survive regime changes better than fragile high-Sharpe signals. The key test is whether performance degrades gracefully or collapses entirely when you slightly adjust lookbacks or neutralization. Do you have specific thresholds for fragility indicators like rolling Sharpe volatility or parameter sensitivity?
