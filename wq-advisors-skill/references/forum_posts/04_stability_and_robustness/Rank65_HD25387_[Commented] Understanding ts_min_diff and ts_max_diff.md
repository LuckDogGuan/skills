I’ve been using  **`ts_min_diff`**  and  **`ts_max_diff`**  a lot lately, and they’re surprisingly intuitive.

- **`ts_min_diff(x, n)`**  tells you how far the current value is from its recent  *low* . When this is small, the series is sitting near its downside extreme — useful for spotting potential rebounds.
- **`ts_max_diff(x, n)`**  shows how far the current value is from its recent  *high* . A small value here means the series is holding near highs, often a sign of strength.

I like these because they focus on  **extremes rather than averages** , which makes them feel more “real” in noisy markets. Simple operators, but very effective when combined with ranking or volatility filters.

ts_min_diff and ts_max_diff anchor signals to recent extremes, not averages. They capture proximity to lows or highs, making them robust in noisy markets. Near-lows hint at rebound potential; near-highs signal strength. Simple, intuitive operators that shine when paired with ranking or volatility filters.

Am trying this out mostly with ranking thank you for it

Well put. These operators capture position relative to extremes, which often carries more information than mean-based signals. I’ve also found they work best when combined with ranking or volatility normalization to avoid noisy false signals.

Well said. These operators are powerful because they anchor signals to recent extremes rather than smoothing everything away. They feel especially useful for mean-reversion and strength-confirmation logic.

Nice observation — focusing on distance from recent extremes often cuts through noise better than mean-based signals. These operators feel especially useful when paired with ranking or simple filters.
