## **Tests of Statistical Hypotheses**

Hello. The topic is statistical hypothesis testing. The agenda prepared is as follows.

### Agenda

1. Concepts of statistical hypothesis testing
2. Types of hypotheses
3. Procedures for hypothesis testing
4. Major statistical testing methods

## **1. Concept of statistical hypothesis testing**

Statistical hypothesis testing is a method of evaluating the validity of a hypothesis based on data. It is a key tool for using sample data to confirm whether a hypothesis about a population is correct or to test differences between different groups.

Hypothesis testing is mainly used in the following situations:

- Test the mean, proportion, or variance of a specific population
- Compare the differences between two groups.
- Examine the relationship between variables.

## **2. Types of Hypotheses**

#### **(1) Null Hypothesis (H₀)**

- Indicates a basic assumption or current state.
- Takes the form "no difference" or "no effect."
- Example: The means of the two groups are the same.

#### **(2) Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**

- The opposite hypothesis to the Null Hypothesis.
- It has the form "There is a difference" or "There is an effect."
- Example: The means of the two groups are different.

## **3. Hypothesis testing procedure**

#### **(1) Hypothesis setting**

- Define H₀ and H₁.

#### **(2) Setting the Significance Level (α)**

- The probability of allowing an error, usually 0.05 (5%), is used.
- If α = 0.05, it means that there is a 5% chance of rejecting the wrong H₀.

#### **(3) Calculating test statistics**

- Calculate statistics (T-statistic, Z-statistic, etc.) from data.

#### **(4) Calculating the P-value**

- The probability that the observed result would occur under H₀.
- If P-value < α, reject H₀.

#### **(5) Drawing a conclusion.**

- Evaluate the validity of the hypothesis by rejecting or failing to reject H₀.

## **4. Major statistical testing methods**

#### **(1) T-Test**

The T-test is a statistical test used to compare differences between means.

**1. One-Sample T-Test**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import ttest_1sampdata = [177, 179, 181, 178, 182]t_stat, p_value = ttest_1samp(data, 180)
```

**2. Independent Two-Sample T-Test**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import ttest_indgroup1 = [177, 179, 181, 178, 182]group2 = [170, 172, 174, 171, 173]t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(group1, group2)
```

**3. Paired T-Test**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import ttest_relbefore = [177, 179, 181, 178, 182]after = [175, 177, 179, 176, 180]t_stat, p_value = ttest_rel(before, after)
```

#### **(2) ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**

ANOVA is used to test the difference in means among three or more groups.

**1. One-Way ANOVA**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import f_onewaygroup1 = [177, 179, 181, 178, 182]group2 = [170, 172, 174, 171, 173]group3 = [165, 167, 169, 166, 168]f_stat, p_value = f_oneway(group1, group2, group3)
```

**2. Two-Way ANOVA**

#### **(3) Chi-Square Test**

The Chi-Square Test compares observed frequencies with expected frequencies in categorical data.

**1. Test of independence.**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import chi2_contingencydata = [[10, 20], [20, 40]]chi2, p_value, _, _ = chi2_contingency(data)
```

**2. Goodness-of-fit test.**

#### **(4) Correlation Test**

The Correlation Test evaluates the linear relationship between two variables.

**1. Pearson Correlation**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import pearsonrx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]corr, p_value = pearsonr(x, y)
```

**2. Spearman Correlation**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import spearmanrcorr, p_value = spearmanr(x, y)
```

**3. Kendall Correlation**

```
pythonfrom scipy.stats import kendalltaucorr, p_value = kendalltau(x, y)
```

Statistical hypothesis testing plays a crucial role in data analysis, providing tools to evaluate the validity of a hypothesis based on data. It is essential to select an appropriate testing method and draw reliable conclusions based on the significance level and P-value. By leveraging these testing methods, you can produce more robust and meaningful analytical results!

After making the decision, you interpret the result in the context of the problem. If you reject H₀, you conclude that there is a significant difference or effect. If you fail to reject H₀, you conclude that the data does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim made by the alternative hypothesis.

The  **Goodness-of-Fit test**  is used to determine whether an observed set of frequencies (or counts) match the expected frequencies according to a specific distribution. This test is commonly used when you want to test if a sample data follows a hypothesized distribution (like a normal distribution, uniform distribution, etc.).

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**
  The null hypothesis represents the basic assumption or the current state of affairs. It suggests that there is no significant effect, relationship, or difference between the variables being studied.
  - **Form** : "No difference" or "No effect"
  - **Example** : The means of the two groups are the same.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**
  The alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis. It proposes that there is a significant effect or difference between the variables.
  - **Form** : "There is a difference" or "There is an effect"
  - **Example** : The means of the two groups are different.

This test evaluates the influence of two independent variables on the dependent variable, including their interaction effects.

This can be done using the  `statsmodels`  library in Python. The implementation can be more complex because of interaction effects and the need for a data structure that can handle two independent variables.

**Additional Point** : I would suggest incorporating more advanced imputation techniques and predictive models to form a more optimized model, ensuring better handling of missing data without losing crucial insights.

- **MCAR (Missing Completely At Random)** : Missing data is random, with little impact if the missing rate is small. However, missing data during critical periods can skew results.
- **MAR (Missing At Random)** : Missing data depends on observable factors. Replacing with the mean works, but can be misleading if important data (e.g., high income) is missing.
- **NMAR (Not Missing At Random)** : Missing data is related to the data itself, making it difficult to handle as simple methods like mean imputation can cause bias.

**Handling Methods** :

- **Delete Data** : Simple but can lose valuable information.
- **Imputation** : Methods like mean or median imputation are easy but may be inaccurate in financial contexts.
- **Predictive Models** : Effective with enough data but prone to overfitting.

**Considerations** :

- Identify missing data patterns to avoid bias.
- Minimize data loss without overcomplicating the process.
- Choose the method that aligns with analysis goals.

Statistical hypothesis testing is a critical tool in quantitative research and decision-making, helping to assess the validity of hypotheses using sample data. By following a structured process—formulating hypotheses, selecting the appropriate test, and interpreting results—researchers can draw valid conclusions about populations or differences between groups. It's essential to consider factors like sample size, power, and the risk of errors (Type I and Type II) to ensure robust findings. This methodology plays a pivotal role in ensuring that investment strategies, scientific studies, and business decisions are based on sound statistical evidence.
