If original_group does not cover all stocks in the target Universe, then this operator will regroup stocks the remaining stocks (i.e., stocks do not belong to the original_group) based on the information of backup group, i.e., group2, group3, etc.

- If instrument found in original group, regrouped instrument will be equal to original group index,
- If not found in original, but found in a backup group, regrouped instrument will be equal to max(original group) + 1 + index in backup group,
- For each next backup group, if not found in previous groups, regrouped instrument will be equal to max(original group) + max(first backup group) + ... + max(previous backup group) + 1

Example:

Original group classification, has only 50% coverage of the target universe ( 4 stocks ) :

Instrument

Index Value Original group

A

0

B

1

C

Nan

D

Nan

Back_up group classification :

Instrument

Index Value of Back_up group

A

0

B

1

C

0

D

1

Newgroup= Group_coalesce (Original , Backup group)

Note:  if not found in original, but found in a backup group, regrouped instrument will be equal to max(original group) + 1 + index in backup group,

Max (original_group) = 1

Instrument

Index Value of Newgroup

A

0

B

1

C

2 = 1 + 1 + 0

D

3=  1 + 1 + 1

Thanks, I understand the meaning of the operator now. May I know why it is so important that the explanation for the operator is pinned in "Getting Started with Research" and what is the main and important application scenario? Thanks again and all the best.

Hi,

You can refer to the article here, which explains group_coalesce, along with a few examples:  [WorldQuant BRAIN](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/data-and-operators/detailed-operator-descriptions#50-group_coalesceoriginal_group-group2-group3)

What impact might group coalescing have on backtest results? Could this process lead to overfitting or false discoveries, and how would you mitigate such risks when testing a new alpha strategy?

I would like to ask if nesting too many groups or data to become a custom group can cause overfitting?

Hi  [NH84459](/hc/en-us/profiles/18243573453207-NH84459) 
Yes, nesting too many groups or datasets to create a custom group can potentially lead to overfitting. When you combine too many variables or data points, the model might become too tailored to the specific features of the training data, capturing noise rather than underlying patterns. This can result in poor generalization when applied to new or unseen data. It's important to strike a balance between creating custom groups that capture meaningful relationships and avoiding excessive complexity that could lead to overfitting.

This approach involves  **regrouping**  stocks from an original group and one or more backup groups when the original group does not cover all stocks in the target universe.

- Ensures 100% classification coverage across the target universe.
- Maintains logical grouping for instruments based on their hierarchical order across groups.
- Enables robust handling of missing classifications in primary group definitions.
