## 帖子正文

When testing operators, I noticed certain  **families are robust across many datasets** .

- **Decay operators**  ( `ts_decay_linear` ,  `ts_decay_exp` ) consistently stabilize signals.
- **Rank/zscore transforms**  reduce outlier risk.
- **Higher-moment operators**  (co-skew, co-kurtosis) are powerful but fragile.

Systematically stress-testing operators (swap mean ↔ median, window ±20%) shows whether a signal is  **genuine**  or just  **overfitted to one config** .

👉 Question: Do you systematically operator-swap when testing, or keep experiments minimal to avoid curve fitting?

Systematic operator-swapping is valuable in my view. It helps reveal whether performance comes from genuine structure or just one fragile configuration. I usually run controlled swaps (mean ↔ median, different decay types) to check stability, but avoid excessive combinations that can lead to overfitting.

I think systematic operator-swapping is highly useful because it shows whether an alpha’s strength comes from real underlying structure or just a fragile choice of operators. I typically run controlled swaps—like mean versus median or different decay formulations—to test stability, while staying away from overly exhaustive combinations that just introduce overfitting risk.

I do light operator-swapping early on. If the alpha only works for one exact window or one decay, that’s usually a red flag for overfitting.
