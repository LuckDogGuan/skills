## 帖子正文

When refining normalized signals (e.g., after zscore()), how do you choose the exponent in signed_power() to amplify strong signals without introducing excess noise or turnover, and which metrics (IC, Sharpe, turnover) guide that decision?

The correct optimization sequence (important)

Never tune p directly on Sharpe.(p is data field)

Correct order:

Fix the raw signal

Normalize (zscore)

Freeze everything

Sweep p in small increments (e.g., 1.0 → 2.0 in steps of 0.1)

Observe three metrics jointly

After  `zscore()` , I usually start  `signed_power()`  in the  **1.2–2.0**  range. Lower exponents (≈1–1.5) gently boost conviction while preserving IC stability; higher ones (>2) often amplify noise, raising  **turnover**  and drawdowns. I pick the exponent via  **small sweeps** , favoring levels where  **IC is time-stable** ,  **Sharpe improves without a turnover spike** , and  **Robust Sharpe**  doesn’t deteriorate. If turnover rises faster than Sharpe, the exponent is too aggressive.

Great point on process discipline. I’d add that when sweeping the exponent, I usually look for stability plateaus rather than peak Sharpe—where IC, turnover, and drawdown remain relatively flat across nearby p values. That tends to indicate the amplification is structural, not just noise fitting.

Overall, you  *can*  use  `signed_power`  or skip it — sometimes it works well. But it doesn’t change the alpha’s underlying financial meaning; it only rescales the signal values (a numeric stretch/compression). (jzc
