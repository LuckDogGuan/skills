**Abstract:**

The Shanghai Stock Exchange changed its trading mechanism of the preceding three minutes to closing from continuous trading to call auction on August 20, 2018, while Shenzhen had already changed this in 2006. Taking all A-shared stocks’ data from 2017 to 2019 as our sample, we construct difference-in-difference models and find significant trading volume shifts from closing call to preceding continuous trading. We also see a significant increase in volatility in call preceding continuous trading, but a significant decrease in closing price deviation in a closing call. Market efficiency is found to be improved by these changes, perhaps due to less liquidity noise in the closing price. Our conclusions remain robust in various robustness checks. It suggests that the introduction of closing call auction would reduce manipulation and liquidity noise in the closing price, thus improving market efficiency in China.

Hey TD17989's idea of regressing vwap or return on pv27 dependent variables sounds interesting. It could potentially reveal useful relationships in the market data. But we should also consider if there are other factors that might affect the results, like market conditions or specific stock characteristics. Maybe we can do more robustness checks to make sure those good results hold up. Just my two cents.

Post-implementation, a notable redistribution of trading volumes was observed. Specifically, there was a significant reduction in trading activity during the closing call auction, accompanied by an increase in the minutes preceding it. This suggests that traders adjusted their strategies to align with the new mechanism, potentially to mitigate risks associated with order execution during the call auction period.

---

### 评论 #10 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1年前)

The introduction of the closing call auction led to a discernible increase in volatility during the continuous trading period immediately before the auction. Conversely, volatility during the closing call auction itself decreased. This indicates that while the call auction stabilized end-of-day prices, it may have shifted some price fluctuations to the preceding continuous trading period.

This paper examines the impact of the Shanghai Stock Exchange's transition from continuous trading to a call auction mechanism for the three minutes leading up to the market close, which occurred on August 20, 2018. The study analyzes data from 2017 to 2019 for all A-shared stocks and employs difference-in-difference models. The results show significant shifts in trading volume from closing call auctions to the preceding continuous trading period, as well as a rise in volatility during the call auction period. However, there was a decrease in closing price deviation, suggesting improved market efficiency due to reduced liquidity noise. The findings support the idea that closing call auctions help reduce manipulation and enhance market efficiency in China.

The research paper highlights a significant evolution in the trading mechanism of Chinese stock exchanges, specifically the introduction of a call auction system during the closing minutes of trading. This change, implemented by the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2018, brings its operations in line with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, which adopted this mechanism earlier in 2006. The study effectively captures the impact of this transition on trading volume, volatility, and closing price formation, presenting a detailed analysis of how these changes influence market behavior and efficiency. The authors’ use of difference-in-difference models and extensive data sets spanning three years adds empirical rigor, allowing for robust conclusions about the implications of the new system.

One of the standout findings is the observed shift in trading volume from the closing call auction to the preceding continuous trading session. This shift underscores the behavioral adjustments traders make when a call auction system is introduced, as they seek to optimize their positions in light of new market conditions. The study also identifies an increase in volatility during the continuous trading period that precedes the call auction. This finding provides valuable insights into how market participants adjust their strategies in response to changes in trading mechanisms, particularly when anticipating the final call auction.

---

### 评论 #46 (作者: MA70307, 时间: 1年前)

Another important aspect of the study is the observed reduction in closing price deviation as a result of the call auction. This suggests that the mechanism introduces greater price stability by reducing noise and manipulation, thereby leading to more accurate price discovery. The reduction in liquidity noise, specifically, highlights the benefits of the call auction system for enhancing market efficiency. This finding is particularly relevant for regulators and policymakers aiming to ensure fair and efficient trading environments while minimizing opportunities for price manipulation.

---

### 评论 #47 (作者: MA70307, 时间: 1年前)

The paper’s emphasis on market efficiency offers a compelling argument for the broader adoption of closing call auctions, particularly in markets that currently rely solely on continuous trading. By demonstrating how the call auction reduces noise in the closing price, the study supports the notion that trading mechanisms can be designed to optimize liquidity and transparency. The implications for international markets are significant, as the findings may inspire similar reforms in other regions seeking to improve their market structures.
