- **Goal:**  Extract market sentiment and forward-looking insights.
- **Method:**
  - Convert unstructured text data (news, reports, analyst opinions) into quantifiable sentiment scores (e.g., positive/negative/neutral).
  - Use NLP models or sentiment analysis libraries (like  `VADER`  or  `FinBERT` ) to score financial news.
  - Track key metrics: sentiment score, frequency of mentions, and subject relevance to assets.
  - `SentimentScore = vec_avg(mdl109_news_sent_3m)`
  `trade_when(SentimentScore > 0.5)`

It's fantastic to see how sentiment analysis and NLP models can be leveraged for actionable trading signals, especially by tapping into unstructured data like news and analyst opinions. This approach provides a great competitive edge by adding real-time market insights that traditional metrics might miss. Ranking trading signals and managing missing data with backfilling are crucial for ensuring model robustness, and backtesting further solidifies the strategy by testing its effectiveness in live market conditions.

As for handling potential biases in news or analyst data, it's important to take several steps to ensure that these inputs are reliable and representative. One way to mitigate bias is by incorporating multiple data sources to cross-check sentiment or by applying normalization techniques to account for different sources' varying reliability. Additionally, ensuring that sentiment thresholds are adjusted based on asset volatility and market conditions can help refine the quality of signals. Biases can also be reduced by using statistical methods such as weighted averages or filtering out extreme outliers.

**What are your thoughts on adjusting sentiment thresholds dynamically based on market volatility or asset characteristics?**

### 评论 #26 (作者: SK14400, 时间: 1年前)

You're highlighting a key aspect of modern alpha generation— **leveraging unstructured data like news and analyst opinions**  alongside traditional time-series signals.

### **Enhancing News and Analyst Data Processing for Alpha Generation**

✔  **Sentiment Scoring**  – Instead of treating all news equally, using  **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  to assign sentiment scores can improve signal quality. Techniques like  **TF-IDF weighting, word embeddings (BERT, Word2Vec), and LLM-based sentiment analysis**  can extract deeper insights.

✔  **Event Detection & Relevance Filtering**  – Not all news impacts stock prices equally.  **Topic modeling (LDA, Transformer-based classifiers)**  helps filter out irrelevant news and focus on impactful events like earnings surprises, regulatory changes, or industry disruptions.

✔  **Time Decay Weighting**  – News signals decay over time. Applying  **exponential smoothing or decay functions**  ensures older news doesn’t overly influence predictions.

✔  **Cross-Asset Signal Correlations**  – Analyst sentiment on a stock often correlates with its sector. Incorporating  **sector-wide sentiment trends**  can enhance signal robustness.

### **Better Signal Ranking & Integration**

📌  **Rank-Neutralization**  – Ranking signals sector-wise prevents concentration in high-volatility industries.
📌  **Feature Engineering with Analyst Data**  – Analyst ratings alone can be noisy, but  **combining analyst revision trends with sentiment changes**  can strengthen predictive power.
📌  **Factor Combination Approaches**  – Merging news-based signals with traditional factors (momentum, volatility, earnings surprises) helps refine alpha models.
