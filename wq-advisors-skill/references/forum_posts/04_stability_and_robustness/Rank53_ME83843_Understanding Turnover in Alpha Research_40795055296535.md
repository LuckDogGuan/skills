One metric I’ve been paying more attention to lately is  **Turnover** .
At first, I mainly focused on Sharpe and Fitness, but over time I realized turnover plays a big role in determining whether an alpha is actually practical and robust.

**What is Turnover?**

Turnover measures how much an alpha changes its positions over time.

In simple terms:

• High turnover → positions change frequently
• Low turnover → positions are held for longer

If an alpha completely reshuffles positions every day, turnover is high.
If positions change gradually, turnover is lower.

**Why does turnover matter?**

Because real markets are not free to trade.

Every change in position introduces costs like:
• Slippage
• Bid-ask spreads
• Market impact
• Liquidity constraints

So even if an alpha looks strong in-sample, high turnover can significantly reduce real-world performance.

That’s why turnover is not just a metric — it reflects how  **tradable and scalable**  an alpha is.

**General Turnover Ranges (Practical Guide)**

These are not strict rules, but useful guidelines:

•  **Below 10%**  → Very stable, slow-moving alpha
•  **10% – 30%**  → Often a healthy and efficient range
•  **30% – 50%**  → More reactive, but costs become important
•  **Above 50%**  → Very aggressive; needs strong edge to survive costs

From my observation, many robust alphas tend to sit around the  **10%–30% range** , especially for consistency over time.

**What affects turnover?**

Some operators naturally reduce turnover:
• ts_decay_linear
• hump
• trade_when
• ts_backfill
• longer lookbacks

Others increase responsiveness (and turnover):
• shorter lookbacks
• ts_delta
• fast ranks / zscores
• highly reactive signals

The key is balance — not too slow, not too reactive.

**One important lesson**

High turnover doesn’t automatically mean a bad alpha.
Sometimes it just means the signal is noisy and over-reacting.

On the other hand, too little turnover can oversmooth the signal and remove useful information.

So the goal is not minimum turnover — it’s  **efficient turnover that reflects real predictive changes** .

**Final thought**

Turnover is basically a measure of how “active” or “restless” an alpha is.

Good alphas don’t just predict well — they trade efficiently in real market conditions.

Curious how others here think about turnover management. What range has worked best in your experience?
