It depends on the specific case.

Great question! In practice, changing data granularity can significantly shift both the stability and predictive power of an alpha. Daily data tends to capture short-term dynamics but is often noisier, so signals may require more smoothing or stronger normalization. Weekly granularity usually improves stability by filtering out noise, making patterns more persistent. Monthly data is the most stable, but its lower frequency can delay reactions to market changes and reduce responsiveness. The key is matching granularity to the horizon and behavior your alpha is designed to capture.

Increasing granularity adds noise, microstructure bias, and overfitting risk, decreasing granularity increases stability, robustness, and signal sustainability, but may miss short-lived opportunities.

Changing data granularity affects alpha behavior. Daily data captures short-term moves but is noisy; weekly improves stability; monthly is most stable but less responsive. Match granularity to your alpha’s horizon and goal.

Data granularity plays a central role in determining both the stability and the predictive power of an alpha, and the optimal choice depends heavily on the signal’s economic intuition and time horizon. Daily data offers the highest responsiveness and is well suited for short-term effects such as microstructure dynamics, short-lived momentum, or liquidity-driven patterns. However, it is also the noisiest, making alphas more sensitive to outliers, regime shifts, and overfitting unless sufficient smoothing, ranking, or volatility normalization is applied. Weekly granularity often strikes a practical balance: it filters out a large portion of daily noise while still reacting reasonably fast to changing conditions, which is why many stable production alphas implicitly behave like weekly signals even when built on daily data with decay. Monthly data tends to produce the most stable and robust signals, especially for value, quality, or macro-driven effects, but the trade-off is reduced timeliness and lower capacity for capturing short-term opportunities. In practice, testing how Sharpe, turnover, and decay behave as you resample or smooth the signal across granularities is one of the most effective robustness checks available.

This is an excellent point, because data granularity has a major impact on how an alpha behaves in practice. Using daily data often allows you to capture short-term market movements, but it also introduces a lot of noise, which means the signal usually needs stronger smoothing, normalization, or filtering to remain stable. Weekly data tends to strike a better balance by reducing noise while still reacting reasonably quickly to changes, often resulting in more persistent patterns. Monthly data is typically the most stable and robust, but its low frequency can cause delays in responding to regime shifts or sudden market events. Ultimately, the right granularity depends on the alpha’s intended holding period, turnover constraints, and economic intuition. Aligning the data frequency with the signal’s objective is critical for achieving both stability and predictive power.

How do you decide when increased stability is worth the loss in responsiveness?

Data granularity is a key driver of both alpha stability and predictive strength, and the right choice depends on the underlying economic intuition and intended time horizon. Daily data provides fast responsiveness and is well suited for short-term effects like microstructure behavior, liquidity patterns, or brief momentum, but it is also highly noisy and prone to overfitting without proper smoothing or normalization. Weekly granularity often offers a strong compromise, reducing much of the day-to-day noise while remaining responsive enough to changing market conditions, which is why many durable alphas effectively behave like weekly signals through decay. Monthly data delivers the greatest stability and robustness, particularly for value or macro-style signals, though at the cost of slower reaction. Comparing Sharpe, turnover, and decay across granularities is one of the most effective ways to test signal robustness.

Changing data frequency really changes how an alpha behaves. Daily data picks up quick moves but comes with a lot of noise, weekly smooths things out, and monthly is very stable but slower to react. The key is matching the granularity to what your alpha is trying to achieve.
