## 帖子正文

I’ve noticed that applying nonlinear functions (like square root, power, or even abs) before ranking sometimes changes the signal direction or stability. Curious if others see this as genuine signal improvement or just curve-fitting artifacts.

Interesting point — nonlinear transforms can definitely reshape signals in ways that ranking alone can’t capture. I’ve also seen cases where a simple abs() or sqrt() improved stability by reducing noise, while power() sometimes amplified extremes too much and hurt OS results. For me, the key is testing across multiple regions and transformations — if the improvement persists, I consider it real signal strength, not just curve-fitting.

大佬提到的非线性变换对排序前信号的影响确实是个值得探讨的问题。我在WorldQuant Brain平台上用算子和operator回测时也发现，像平方根、绝对值这类非线性函数有时会改变因子的IC值和稳定性。不过需要谨慎区分这是真正的信号增强还是过拟合的结果。建议在回测中加入严格的样本外测试和多重假设检验，毕竟非线性变换容易引入额外的自由度。从经验来看，简单的非线性变换通常能改善因子分布的正态性，但信号方向的改变需要仔细验证其经济逻辑。

I always test that, and I can say it's a game-changer; however, some data fields do not allow such. But generally, that is always a great approach!

Nonlinear transformations can reshape signals in ways that ranking alone can’t replicate. I’ve also found that simple functions like abs() or sqrt() often improve stability by dampening noise, whereas power() can over-emphasize extremes and weaken out-of-sample performance. For me, the real test is applying various transforms across multiple regions — if the improvement holds consistently, I treat it as genuine signal strength rather than curve-fitting.

I’ve seen the same thing. Nonlinear functions can sometimes help by reducing extreme values and making the signal smoother, but other times they flip the direction or create patterns that look good only in backtests. I usually test the raw version and the transformed one side-by-side to see if the improvement is consistent across regions and time. If the effect isn’t stable, I treat it as possible curve-fitting rather than real signal strength.
