If you need to get the  **maximum points in the MAPC** , you need to be curious about how to improve your alphas. You may have a good signal, but it's not good enough to secure a good score. You may get a few points and be satisfied, yet you can secure even more. To get the best points with your alpha, you need these ideas to implement.

Check the following;

**1. Maximize your alpha Sharpe**

Sharpe reflects the overall performance of your alpha. MAPC reflects the performance of your alpha, and thus its scoring definitely counts for your alpha Sharpe. So, the more Sharpe your alpha has, the more points for the competition

**2. Have a High Fitness Value in your alpha**

An alpha's fitness is an important metric to always consider while creating alphas. While you need to have your alpha have a fitness minimum of 1 unit, for the sake of MAPC, have your alpha maintain a fitness of  **greater than 2** (I get more points with that). This way, you will achieve higher points. In other words, the more fitness your alpha has, the more points you gain.

**3. Maintain a Higher Margin (>4 units)**

Margin is another metric that an alpha portrays. The platform is not limited to any minimum, hence you can have as low a margin for your alpha. This case is crucial because one may think the margin does not have an impact on MAPC scoring. However, it's as important as and needs to be considered while creating good signals.

As a matter of fact, a better performing alpha should maintain a margin point of 4, and an even better alpha should  **have 4> points of margin**  as a metric.

In MAPC, try to keep the same idea, 4> Margin. In this way, be sure to get more scores. Otherwise, maximizing your alpha margin helps you gain even more points!

**4. Minimize Turnover**

Turnover measures the cost of alpha usage in the real-time market. Higher turnovers may sometimes be useful when an alpha secures a lot returns. However, if an alpha has fewer returns, it may not be worthy enough when the turnover is high. In MAPC, turnover does not have a lot of impact on the scoring criteria when other metrics are maintained as discussed above.

Anyways, to secure more points, turnover can help if the above metrics are already high. So, have a  **turnover of less than 20%**  to get even more scores for the MAPC.

In summary, to maximize your score in MAPC,

> Raise your  **Sharpe ratio**  as high as possible, because MAPC heavily rewards strong overall performance.

> Ensure your alpha has a  **fitness value well above the minimum** , ideally above 2, to earn more points.

> Maintain a  **margin greater than 4 units** , since margin is a valuable metric in scoring.

> Finally,  **keep turnover low**  (preferably under 20%)—especially once the other metrics are strong—so that your alpha’s costs don’t erode your gains.

In short: maximize Sharpe, fitness, and margin, while minimizing turnover, to earn the  ***highest MAPC points*** .

Nice observation fellow Quant. I hope everyone observes the same to maximize their points in the ongoing competition (MAPC). Once again, Kudos....

Thank you for your insight,  **@顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44)** . 

I’d also add that keeping  **production correlation** and  **self-correlation**  low is key. Low prod correlation ensures your alpha isn’t too similar to others, while low self-correlation avoids redundancy in your own signals, both help improve uniqueness and boost MAPC points.

Great breakdown. Your emphasis on Sharpe, fitness, and margin as the main levers for MAPC scoring is spot on. Keeping turnover low as a final optimization step makes sense too, since it protects gains once the core metrics are strong. Clear, practical, and directly applicable advice for anyone aiming to maximize their MAPC score.

Excellent breakdown! Highlighting Sharpe, fitness, and margin as MAPC score levers is spot on. Lowering turnover afterward smartly protects gains once metrics are strong. Clear, practical advice for maximizing MAPC scoring effectiveness.

Hi. Thanks a lot for laying this out so clearly! I’ve always known MAPC rewards Sharpe heavily, but I hadn’t thought as much about margin being such an important factor in scoring. The way you explained it makes me realize I should be more intentional about balancing these metrics instead of just focusing on one. I’ll definitely experiment with fitness >2 and margin >4 going forward. By the way, do you track these metrics separately before MAPC, or just rely on simulation outputs?

Hello everyone,

If you’re participating in MAPC, you probably know that even a good alpha isn’t always enough to secure the best score. To truly maximize your MAPC points, you need to pay close attention to a few critical metrics beyond just “having a working alpha.”

Here are some practical guidelines that can help:

### 1.  **Maximize Sharpe Ratio**

Sharpe is the most important performance metric. Since MAPC rewards strong overall risk-adjusted performance, raising your Sharpe as high as possible should be your top priority.

### 2.  **Aim for Higher Fitness (>2)**

Fitness is more than a checkbox metric. While a minimum of 1 is acceptable, in practice you should target  **fitness above 2**  to consistently achieve higher MAPC scores. Strong fitness shows that your alpha is not just performing, but performing robustly.

### 3.  **Keep Margin Above 4 Units**

Margin often gets overlooked, but it plays a key role in MAPC scoring. A margin above 4 units demonstrates that your alpha has a strong performance buffer. The higher the margin, the better your chances of scoring well.

### 4.  **Minimize Turnover (<20%)**

Turnover represents trading cost. While it may not weigh as heavily in MAPC scoring as Sharpe, fitness, or margin, lowering turnover helps protect your returns once the other metrics are strong. A good rule of thumb is to keep turnover under 20%.

Thanks for explaining this so clearly — I’ve always known MAPC emphasizes Sharpe, but I hadn’t realized how much margin impacts scoring too. Your breakdown makes me see that I should balance these metrics intentionally instead of focusing on just one. I’ll start experimenting with fitness >2 and margin >4. Quick question: do you usually track these metrics separately before MAPC, or just rely on the simulation outputs?

I appreciate your perspective, @顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44). Additionally, I would emphasize that maintaining low production correlation and self-correlation is essential. A low production correlation guarantees that your alpha remains distinct from others, while a low self-correlation prevents redundancy within your own signals. Both factors contribute to enhancing uniqueness and increasing MAPC points
