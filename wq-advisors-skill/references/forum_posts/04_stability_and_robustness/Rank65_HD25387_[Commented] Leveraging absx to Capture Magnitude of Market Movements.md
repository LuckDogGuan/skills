When designing alphas, do you prefer using  `abs()`  to highlight volatility and anomalies, or do you find directional signals (without  `abs()` ) generally more informative for trading decisions?

In my experience, it really depends on the alpha’s purpose. When I want to capture pure magnitude effects or volatility shocks without caring about the direction, I use  `abs()` . It works well in cases where extreme deviations themselves carry information, like in risk or liquidity-based signals. However, for momentum, reversal, or trend-following ideas, I prefer keeping the direction intact because it often provides more meaningful trading signals. So I usually decide based on whether directionality adds value to the hypothesis behind the alpha.

Interesting point — I usually keep direction when the strategy is trend-following, but use  `abs()`  when focusing on volatility or anomaly detection.

This is an interesting trade-off and I think it really comes down to the type of effect you want the alpha to capture. Using  `abs(x)`  essentially strips away directional information and focuses purely on the size of deviations, which can be very useful in contexts like volatility clustering or liquidity shocks where magnitude itself is predictive. On the other hand, ignoring direction means you lose valuable context in momentum or mean-reversion frameworks, where the sign of the movement often matters more than the size. One thing I’ve been wondering is whether a hybrid approach could sometimes work—for example, applying  `abs(x)`  in combination with another directional feature to separate the magnitude and the sign into two complementary signals. That way you don’t have to completely discard one dimension of information. Testing this might reveal whether there’s incremental alpha in modeling direction and magnitude separately.

Using  **`abs(x)`**  highlights the  *magnitude*  of movements, making it useful for volatility or anomaly detection. But when direction matters (e.g., momentum or reversal signals), keeping the raw value without  `abs()`  is generally more informative for trading.

Exactly—this trade-off really depends on what your alpha is trying to capture. Using  `abs(x)`  removes directional information, highlighting only the magnitude, which can be powerful for detecting volatility spikes or liquidity shocks. However, you lose context in momentum or mean-reversion strategies, where the sign of the move is often more important than its size. A hybrid approach can be promising—combining  `abs(x)`  with a separate directional feature lets you model magnitude and direction independently, potentially uncovering incremental alpha by preserving both dimensions of information.

This is a very relevant design choice in alpha construction, and I think the decision between applying  `abs(x)`  or keeping the raw signed values should be tied to the specific market hypothesis. Using  `abs(x)`  is powerful when the goal is to capture stress, anomalies, or volatility clustering, because it isolates magnitude as the key signal dimension. For example, in liquidity shocks or extreme volume spikes, the fact that a move is “big” is often more informative than whether it is up or down. On the other hand, in momentum, reversal, or factor continuation frameworks, stripping out the sign removes essential directional information that can drive returns. A workflow I find useful is to explicitly split the two components: create one feature that keeps the signed value and another that takes the absolute. This separation allows you to test whether magnitude and direction carry independent predictive power or interact synergistically. In practice, I’ve seen cases where including both dimensions together strengthens robustness and reduces noise compared to relying solely on one.

Exactly—abs(x) emphasizes magnitude, useful for volatility or liquidity signals, but loses directional info critical for momentum or mean-reversion. Combining it with a directional feature preserves both, capturing magnitude and direction for incremental alpha.

大佬提到的abs()使用确实是个有意思的话题。在WorldQuant Brain平台上做回测时，我发现abs()在捕捉波动率特征方面很有价值，特别是对于均值回归类策略。不过正如文章所问，方向性信号和绝对值信号各有优劣：abs()能过滤掉方向性噪音，突出异常波动，但可能丢失趋势信息。我在构建alpha因子时通常会同时测试两种版本，比如用abs(returns)和原始returns分别作为输入，看哪个在回测中表现更好。有时候组合使用效果更佳，比如用方向信号确定趋势，用abs信号确定入场时机。不过具体效果还是要看具体市场和标的，需要大量回测验证。
