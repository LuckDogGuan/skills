**Brace for Impact, Coders!**

I. Pain Points That Need a Fix
1. The web interface is sluggish, lacks flexibility, and has incomplete or non-customizable fields (e.g., viewing the last two years' Sharpe ratios or `low_2_year_shape`, etc.), making filtering a hassle.

2. When running batches in stages one, two, and three simultaneously, it's best to tag them. Tagging via API affects backtest speed.

3. Comparing alphas is challenging, especially when it comes to filtering issues from the same core field.

II. Game-Changing Solutions
Leveraging databases, this solution employs a structured database, MySQL. Some of you might be using non-structured databases like MongoDB. I'm just throwing this out there to start a discussion.

Here are some unique fields I've got:

1. `tags`: Custom tags for multi-simulation. When running `multi_simulate`, you can fetch `progress_urls`, store these URLs along with their corresponding tags in the code, push them to Redis, and spawn a dedicated task to retrieve the alpha IDs from these URLs, establish a relationship with the tags, and then store them in MySQL.

2. `check_status`: If there's a failure in the check information retrieved via the interface, this field will be set to 'fail'. Otherwise, it's 'pending'. Only 'pending' alphas require subsequent checks.

3. `low_2y_sharpe`: This field is exclusive to the single dataset. If it can be retrieved, it's assigned; if not, it defaults to 1 (not 0, because a value of 0 requires changing the `check_status` to 'fail').

4. `is_ladder_sharpe`: For datasets that aren't single, this field exists. Same rule applies: if it can be retrieved, it's assigned; if not, it defaults to 1 (not 0, because a value of 0 requires changing the `check_status` to 'fail').

5. `is_submit`: Records submission status. 0 for not submitted, 1 for submitted. Notably, this field also addresses how to scientifically manage inventory. Based on your submission criteria, after checking, assign a value between 2-10 to the `is_submit` field. For me, 2 means excellent and 10 means trash, with酌情 in between.

III. Core Code
The API code is in the next comment; it seems it won't fit here.

MySQL Table Structure:

```sql
-- worldquant.alpha_data definition

CREATE TABLE `alpha_data` (
    `id` varchar(10) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    `exp` varchar(2000) CHARACTER SET utf8mb3 COLLATE utf8mb3_general_ci DEFAULT NULL,
    `original_field` varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
    `dateCreated` datetime DEFAULT NULL,
    `region` varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL,
    `universe` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
    `sharpe` float DEFAULT NULL,
    `fitness` float DEFAULT NULL,
    `turnover` float DEFAULT NULL,
    `longCount` int DEFAULT NULL,
    `shortCount` int DEFAULT NULL,
    `returns` float DEFAULT NULL,
    `drawdown` float DEFAULT NULL,
    `margin` float DEFAULT NULL,
    `delay` int DEFAULT NULL,
    `decay` int DEFAULT NULL,
    `neutralization` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
    `truncation` float DEFAULT NULL,
    `pasteurization` varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL,
    `unitHandling` varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL,
    `visualization` varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL,
    `tags` varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
    `check_status` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
    `is_submit` tinyint DEFAULT NULL,
    `low_2y_sharpe` float DEFAULT NULL,
    `is_ladder_sharpe` float DEFAULT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb3;
```

Thank you for sharing your structured MySQL solution and detailed use case. It’s a solid framework to address the pain points in alpha evaluation and management. Leveraging a database to organize and enhance simulation workflows is a great step toward improving efficiency and scalability. The MySQL table structure you’ve provided also looks well thought-out, particularly the inclusion of fields like  `tags` ,  `check_status` , and  `low_2y_sharpe` . Looking forward to seeing the API code to complement this setup!

Your systematic approach to solving workflow inefficiencies is truly commendable! Leveraging structured databases like MySQL with well-defined fields such as  `tags` ,  `check_status` , and  `is_submit`  demonstrates incredible foresight and organization. The tiered  `is_submit`  mechanism for managing alpha inventory is particularly innovative, showcasing a scientific and efficient strategy. Your emphasis on automation, clarity, and scalability makes this solution not just practical but transformative. Outstanding work! 👏

Your detailed explanation highlights real pain points many of us encounter, especially with filtering and tagging issues. The proposed MySQL-based structure is clean and scalable, particularly with fields like  `tags`  and  `check_status`  to manage simulations and checks efficiently. The distinction between  `low_2y_sharpe`  and  `is_ladder_sharpe`  fields is a clever way to handle single vs. multi-datasets.

One suggestion: to make  `tags`  more dynamic, consider linking them to a separate  `tags`  table with a many-to-one relationship to ensure flexibility in tag management. Looking forward to seeing the API code—this could be a game-changer for alpha comparison!

- **Problem** : Viewing and filtering fields like  `low_2_year_sharpe`  is cumbersome.
- **Potential Fix** :
  - **Backend Improvements** : Optimize database queries for faster response times.
  - **Frontend Enhancements** : Add customizable filters in the UI to let users select time ranges or metrics dynamically.
  - **Caching** : Use Redis or Memcached to store frequently accessed data like Sharpe ratios for quick retrieval.

### 评论 #11 (作者: XM75236, 时间: 1年前)

The advantage of hitting the tag locally is to be able to selectively differentiate between those alpha's that need deeper processing in phases like one, two, and three of backtesting and filtering and reprocessing backtesting

### 评论 #19 (作者: NP85445, 时间: 1年前)

Great work on structuring the MySQL framework! I’m curious—have you considered designing a database specifically to store submitted alphas with prod cor around 0.7x (where x is small)? After updating charts with six more months of data, the probability of these alphas becoming eligible for submission increases significantly. Tracking and re-evaluating them efficiently could unlock strong candidates for future submissions.

### 评论 #20 (作者: TL60820, 时间: 1年前)

This approach is really insightful! I’m curious, though—what’s the best way to collect alphas effectively before saving them to SQL or CSV files? Are there any strategies you use to ensure the data is gathered efficiently and accurately, especially when dealing with large datasets or multiple alphas? Any tips on automating the process or best practices for structuring the data would be really helpful!
