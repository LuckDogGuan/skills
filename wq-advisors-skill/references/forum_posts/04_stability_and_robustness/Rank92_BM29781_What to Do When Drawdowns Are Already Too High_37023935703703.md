## 帖子正文

When drawdowns are elevated, the problem is rarely the idea itself. In most cases,  **returns are acceptable, but the PnL path is unstable** . At this stage, chasing higher returns usually  *worsens*  drawdowns. The correct objective shifts to:

> **Reduce drawdowns first, even if it costs some returns.**

Below is a practical, structure-first approach for damage control.

### 1. Stop Amplifying Extremes

Large drawdowns often come from a few extreme signal values dominating PnL.

**Fix:**  normalize or cap immediately.

`rank(alpha)
`

or

`clamp(alpha, -3, 3)
`

This alone often cuts max drawdown materially.

### 2. Neutralize Before Optimizing

Hidden market, sector, or country exposure creates slow, grinding drawdowns.

**Fix:**  remove unintended bets early.

`neutralize(alpha, industry)
`

If returns collapse after neutralization, the alpha was a factor bet, not a signal.

### 3. Reduce Reaction Speed

Fast signals create fast drawdowns. When DD is high, slow the signal slightly.

**Fix:**  apply light decay.

`decay_linear(alpha, 5)
`

Small smoothing usually reduces drawdown far more than it reduces returns.

### 4. Lengthen the Weakest Window

Short windows are the most common source of instability.

**Fix:**  increase the shortest lookback first.

`ts_rank(field, 20) → ts_rank(field, 60)
`

If the alpha breaks, it was noise-driven.

### 5. Avoid Trading During Known Bad Regimes

Most deep drawdowns happen in volatility spikes or regime shifts.

**Fix:**  condition execution.

`trade_when(ts_rank(df, 252) < 0.8, alpha, 0)
`

Skipping the worst environments often improves R/DD more than any smoothing.

### 6. Control Turnover

High turnover magnifies drawdowns via noise and costs.

**Fix:**  combine decay + conditioning instead of aggressive reactivity.

`decay_linear(alpha, 3)
`

### 7. Accept Lower Returns Temporarily

When drawdowns are high,  **stability is the priority** .

A common outcome:

- Returns ↓ slightly
- Max drawdown ↓ significantly
- R/DD ↑ meaningfully

That trade-off is correct.

### A Stabilized Template (Drawdown-First)

`trade_when(
  ts_rank(df, 252) < 0.8,
  decay_linear(
    neutralize(rank(alpha_raw), industry),
    5
  ),
  0
)
`

### Final Rule

> **When drawdowns are high, optimization should feel boring.**
> If changes make the alpha faster or sharper, you’re likely making it worse.
