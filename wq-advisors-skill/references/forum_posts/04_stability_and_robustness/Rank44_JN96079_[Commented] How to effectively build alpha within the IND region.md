Hello everyone, we're starting a new week with the opportunity to build an alpha of the IND region using datasets from "Insiders, Sentiment, News, Other, Option".

As a new consultant, I find these datasets a bit difficult to build an alpha of. Could anyone share some tips on how to use functions and data more effectively? Thanks.

For IND, I’ve found it helpful to keep signals simple and robust. Datasets like sentiment or news tend to be noisy, so smoothing, ranking, and using longer decay often helps. I usually combine them with basic price or volume context and focus more on stability and intuition than on maximizing short-term Sharpe.

Building alpha in the IND region definitely requires a different approach since datasets like sentiment and news are naturally noisier. I’ve found that instead of over-optimizing, focusing on broader ranking and longer decay periods helps pull out a cleaner signal. Combining these with basic volume context usually produces a more robust result than trying to chase a high short-term Sharpe. It’s really about finding that balance between intuition and stability.

For IND, I’ve found it most effective to keep signals simple and robust. Sentiment or news datasets are often noisy, so applying smoothing, ranking, and longer decay tends to help, especially when they’re paired with basic price or volume context. Overall, I focus more on stability and clear intuition than on maximizing short-term Sharpe.

When working in IND, you can get better results by prioritizing simplicity and resilience in signal design. I have got better results as well, with inputs like sentiment or news that can be quite noisy, so applying ranking, smoothing, and longer decay windows often makes them more usable. I tend to anchor these signals with straightforward price or volume context and place greater emphasis on interpretability and stability rather than chasing short-term Sharpe peaks.
