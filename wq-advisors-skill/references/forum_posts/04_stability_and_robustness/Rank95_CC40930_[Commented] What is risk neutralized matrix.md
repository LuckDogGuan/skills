Hello,

I  recently show the newly added feature on brain platform which is  [Risk Neutralized Metrics.](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/advanced-topics/getting-started-risk-neutralized-metrics)

But I tried to use it but not able to understand how it actually works. Any body please explain.

Hi, I think you should read what is risk neutralized alphas first. It can be found in the Learn Section, which is here:
 [Getting Started: Risk Neutralized Alphas | WorldQuant BRAIN](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/advanced-topics/getting-started-risk-neutralized-alphas) 

To my knowledge, BRAIN's just developed a new feature that helps display risk neutralized alpha in a faster way, along with normal long-short-neutral alphas, instead of simulating another SLOW or FAST alpha with longer time of simulation. However, the new feature may have results slightly different from the original risk neutralized by selecting SLOW or FAST neutralization.

In quantitative finance, a  **Risk Neutralized Matrix**  (RNM) typically refers to a mathematical framework or tool used to adjust or "neutralize" the impact of risk factors on a portfolio or a set of financial instruments. The goal is to adjust for risk exposures and ensure that the strategy or model focuses on factors like return prediction, market dynamics, or arbitrage opportunities without being unduly influenced by the inherent risk in the asset or portfolio.A  **Risk Neutralized Matrix**  is an advanced tool used to model and adjust for the risks associated with financial portfolios or instruments. It typically involves applying mathematical transformations or hedging strategies to neutralize the impact of various risk factors on asset returns or prices. This matrix helps in  **portfolio optimization** ,  **derivatives pricing** , and  **risk management**  by ensuring that the risk exposures of different assets are adjusted, leaving behind a neutralized risk profile that focuses on the underlying market dynamics and returns.

To maximize the value of this new feature:

Understand the nuances: Be aware of the small differences in results between this new method and the traditional slow/fast neutralization process, and decide which method works best for your particular needs (e.g., speed vs. precision).

Use it iteratively: The faster neutralization is best used for initial alpha testing and refinement, while the more traditional methods can still be employed for deeper validation or when precise risk adjustment is critical.

This feature represents a powerful tool for faster decision-making and enhanced alpha generation, especially for large-scale data analysis, and aligns with the demand for speed and efficiency in modern quantitative finance.

The  **Risk Neutralized Metrics**  on the Brain platform are designed to adjust or neutralize the impact of specific risks on your alpha strategy’s performance. These metrics help ensure that your alpha is not overly sensitive to particular risks, such as market factors, volatility, or sector-specific influences. By using risk-neutralization techniques, you can isolate the performance of the alpha strategy from these external factors, giving you a clearer view of its intrinsic effectiveness.

The  **Risk Neutralized Metrics**  feature on the  **BRAIN platform**  is designed to help you assess the performance of your strategy or alpha signals in a way that  **removes the impact of overall market risk** . In simpler terms, it allows you to understand how your strategy performs independently of broader market movements, providing a clearer picture of the  **pure alpha**  (returns generated from your strategy itself) rather than being influenced by market fluctuations.

- As market conditions change, periodic rebalancing and monitoring are necessary to ensure that the portfolio remains effective and responsive to shifting trends.
- This could involve recalibrating the weights of strategies in response to their evolving performance or market conditions.

Risk Neutralized Metrics is a useful tool for adjusting trading strategies under the assumption of no risk. However, it is important to note that factors such as market volatility and macroeconomic events can impact real-world outcomes. Therefore, understanding the relationship between assets and adjusting strategies to fit market conditions is crucial

Hi, risk neutralized metric (the green pnl graph in the simulation result) is shown since a few weeks ago, and this indicates the performance of your alpha when widely known risks are neutralized. Based on my experience sharpe increases and returns decreases in common, you might want to question your alpha's robustness if sharpe is not improved after neutralizing. You can apply SLOW+FAST option when you see great performance in neutralized result.

It sounds like the Risk Neutralized Metrics feature could be quite valuable, but I can understand how it might be a bit confusing at first. From my understanding, it likely helps in analyzing risk-adjusted returns. Have you had a chance to check any tutorials or documentation on it? It might give you further insights on how to utilize the feature effectively.
