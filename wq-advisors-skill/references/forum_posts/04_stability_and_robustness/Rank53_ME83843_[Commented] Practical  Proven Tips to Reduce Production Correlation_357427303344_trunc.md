### **Tips: Diversify Alpha Families**

Don’t just use similar mean-reversion or momentum ideas. Mix signal types.

Family
Examples

Price Reversion
 ` -ts_delta(close,1)` 

Momentum
 `ts_rank(close,20)` 

Volume
 `ts_delta(volume,5)` 

Fundamental

 `ebitda/revenue` ,  `roic` ,  `fcf_growth` 

Sentiment

 `news_sentiment` ,  `analyst_rating_change` 

Smart Money

 `inst_ownership_change` ,  `fund_flow` 

Risk Premia

 `idiosync_vol` ,  `beta`

You're right. I used to rely heavily on ts_delta in my alphas, but most of them eventually failed because of trading costs. Also, be mindful of the parameters used in those time-series operators — they can make a big difference.

Great and concise breakdown — I really like how you’ve categorized the signal “families.” It’s a clear reminder that production correlation often comes from using too many signals of the same structural logic (e.g., multiple short-term price reversions). Diversifying by data source and economic intuition — not just by formula — is key to lowering correlation without losing predictive strength.

These tips clearly show why it’s important to use different types of signals instead of similar ones. Many times, using the same kind (like all momentum ideas) increases correlation and reduces real performance. Mixing signals such as price, volume, fundamentals, and sentiment makes the model stronger and more stable in changing markets. I especially liked the point about including smart money and risk factors  they really help in building more reliable and diverse alphas.

Great reminder. Diversifying alpha families helps avoid signal crowding and improves robustness. Combining momentum, reversal, sentiment, and fundamental ideas captures different market behaviors — making your overall alpha portfolio more balanced and resilient across changing regimes.

Great and concise breakdown — the way you’ve grouped the signal “families” is very effective. It highlights how production correlation often stems from relying on too many signals built on the same underlying structure, such as multiple short-term reversal ideas. Meaningful diversification comes from varying data sources and economic intuition, not just tweaking formulas, which helps reduce correlation while preserving predictive strength.

Great reminder — diversifying across different alpha families is crucial for avoiding signal crowding and improving overall robustness. Blending momentum, reversal, sentiment, and fundamental concepts allows you to capture a broader range of market behaviors, creating a more balanced and resilient portfolio that holds up better across shifting market regimes.
