## 帖子正文

When building an alpha, how do you decide between using abs(x) to capture magnitude-only effects (like volatility or liquidity shocks) versus preserving direction for momentum or mean-reversion and have you found hybrid approaches that successfully combine both?

`abs(x)`  is best when you care about  **shock magnitude**  (volatility, liquidity, surprises) regardless of direction, but it  **removes directional information** , making it unsuitable for pure momentum or mean-reversion signals. In practice, many strong alphas use  **hybrid designs** —separating magnitude and direction, e.g.  `rank(abs(x)) * sign(y)` , or using  `abs(x)`  as a regime filter with a directional signal inside. The key is validating whether dropping direction improves IC/Sharpe stability or simply masks the underlying economic logic.

Use abs(x) when the hypothesis is direction-agnostic (volatility, stress, liquidity shocks). Preserve sign when economics imply trend continuation or reversal. Hybrid alphas work well: scale directional signals by abs(x) or volatility-weight them, capturing strength while retaining sign—often improving stability, Sharpe, and regime robustness.

Well said. I’ve also found abs(x) most effective when the underlying intuition is about intensity rather than direction, while hybrid constructions—like scaling a signed signal by its absolute magnitude or volatility—often strike a good balance between expressiveness and robustness across regimes.
