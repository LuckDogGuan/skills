In quantitative alpha construction, doeslog_diff()truly offer a significant advantage over simple returns, especially under high volatility conditions?

When designing alphas, the choice betweenlog_diff()and simple returns depends largely on the market environment. Log-differences provide time-additivity and handle compounding more consistently, which becomes especially useful under high volatility. Simple returns, while more intuitive, can distort signals during sharp price swings. Therefore, log_diff() is often preferred for stability and comparability, particularly in volatile markets.

It depends what you’re doing.Cross-section, one period → No real advantage for log_diff().Across time, high vol, compounding matters → Yes, log_diff() is better (cleaner math, more robust, variance-aware).(jzc

In my opinion log_diff()does truly have an edge over simple returns, especially in volatile markets. The main reason is that log returns areadditive over time, which makes analysis easier, and they handle large price swings more smoothly than simple returns. This stability helps when building signals for models that assume normality or when working with compounding effects.

When building alphas, deciding betweenlog_diff()and simple returns often comes down to how the strategy needs to respond to market conditions.log_diff()offers time-additivity and treats compounding effects more accurately, which is especially advantageous in volatile environments. In contrast, simple returns—though more intuitive—can exaggerate signals during sharp price movements, potentially leading to instability. For this reason,log_diff()is generally favored when stability, consistency, and cross-period comparability are critical.
