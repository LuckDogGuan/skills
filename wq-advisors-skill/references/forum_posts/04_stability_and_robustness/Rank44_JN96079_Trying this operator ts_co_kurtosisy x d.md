## 帖子正文

Hey members, 

I am new to the  ***ts_co_kurtosis(y, x, d)***  operator. Does anyone have an idea of how it is useful in data analysis? I would want to know which ideas and research on data can be useful.

Let's share a few ideas and stay ahead.

Thanks, all!

The operator  **ts_co_kurtosis(y, x, d)**  measures the fourth standardized cross-central moment between two series, highlighting how their extreme values co-occur. Unlike correlation or coskewness, it focuses on shared tail behavior. This is useful for detecting joint volatility clustering, stress scenarios, and building alphas sensitive to extreme market conditions.

This is particularly valuable in financial modeling where you're interested in  *tail dependencies* . For example, two stocks might not be highly correlated on average, but they could both crash together in extreme markets — that's co-kurtosis. Unlike correlation, which measures linear co-movement, co-kurtosis captures how "jointly fat-tailed" two variables are.

Wow, nice explanation. Let me try to implement into my research with your idea. I appreciate,

Thanks!

ts_co_kurtosis(y,x,d) captures co-occurring extremes in two series, focusing on shared tail risk and volatility clustering.

Hi,  [ZK79798](/hc/en-us/profiles/18074113474071-ZK79798) , would you provide a simple alpha that uses the  **ts_co_kurtosis(y,x,d)** operator, so that I would know how precise to use it? If possible, I will appreciate it very much.

The  `ts_co_kurtosis(y, x, d)`  operator calculates the fourth standardized cross-central moment between two series, emphasizing how their extreme values move together. Unlike correlation or coskewness, it specifically captures joint tail behavior, making it valuable for identifying volatility clustering, stress events, and designing alphas that respond to extreme market conditions.

Hi 顾问 JN96079 (Rank 44), Cokurtosis is the fourth standardized cross central moment. It shows how two time-series vectors change together.

he ts_co_kurtosis(y, x, d) operator measures how two series behave together in extreme situations. Unlike correlation, which looks at average co-movement, co-kurtosis focuses on tail risk—like whether both series experience big jumps or crashes at the same time. This can be very useful in finance for spotting hidden risks, stress scenarios, and for designing alphas that react to sudden volatility or market shocks."

Good question, The  **ts_co_kurtosis(y, x, d)**  operator looks at how two time series move together, especially during extreme market events. Unlike correlation, which only measures normal relationships, co-kurtosis shows if both series have big spikes or drops at the same time. This can be useful for risk checks, stress testing, or spotting hidden links between factors. In alpha research, it may help find non-linear patterns that aren’t visible with simple correlation. Testing it with returns or volatility could be interesting.

The  `ts_co_kurtosis(y, x, d)`  operator measures how two series move together in extreme cases. Unlike correlation, it focuses on tail events, showing if both series jump or crash simultaneously—useful for spotting hidden risks and designing alphas sensitive to sudden market shocks.

Cross-kurtosis is highly relevant to alpha making because it helps identify  **"tail risk,"**  or the risk of large, sudden price movements. By using  `ts_co_kurtosis(y, x, d)` , analysts can determine if extreme price movements in one asset tend to coincide with extreme movements in another. For example, if two seemingly unrelated assets have a high cross-kurtosis, it suggests they are not truly independent during periods of market stress. Understanding this helps a portfolio manager avoid a false sense of diversification and create a more robust portfolio that holds up during "black swan" events, which is key to consistent alpha generation.

The  **ts_co_kurtosis(y, x, d)**  operator captures how two series behave together during extremes by computing their fourth standardized cross-central moment. It focuses on joint tail risk—unlike correlation—helpful for spotting stress events and shaping tail-sensitive alphas.

This is especially valuable in financial modeling when analyzing tail dependencies. Two assets might show low average correlation, yet still exhibit a tendency to crash together during extreme market events—that’s where co-kurtosis comes in. Unlike correlation, which captures linear co-movement, co-kurtosis measures how 'jointly fat-tailed' two variables are, offering deeper insight into shared extreme risks.
