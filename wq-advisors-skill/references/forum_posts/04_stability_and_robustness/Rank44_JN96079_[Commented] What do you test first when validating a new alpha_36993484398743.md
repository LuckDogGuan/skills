When I build a new signal, I often struggle with what to prioritize early on. Some people focus first on Information Coefficient (IC) and Sharpe, others on turnover and capacity, while some care more about stability across regions and neutralization effects.

Personally, I’ve found that a signal with modest returns but strong stability often survives longer than a flashy one.

When you create a new alpha, what is the  *first*  metric or check you trust most—and why?
Waiting for your insights....shall be of great help.

I usually start with a popular dataset, plug it into a simple template, and randomly submit dozens of alphas. If I find any alpha with Sharpe > 1.3, I’ll then tune the neutralization, decay, and universe settings to optimize it and narrow the template’s search space. After that, I use the improved settings and refined template to search for truly submittable alphas.

I usually check stability first (IC consistency over time and across subperiods). If the signal isn’t stable, Sharpe and returns tend to be misleading. Turnover and capacity come next once stability is confirmed.

When validating a new alpha on  **WorldQuant Brain** , the very first thing I look for is  **structural stability** , not peak performance. Concretely, I start by checking whether the signal behaves  *sensibly*  across small, intentional perturbations—changes in decay, neutralization, or universe size. If a signal’s IC or Sharpe collapses when decay shifts from, say, 6 to 12, that fragility is usually more informative than a high initial Sharpe. Early robustness tells you whether the alpha is expressing genuine information or simply aligning with a narrow configuration.

Only after that do I look at IC consistency over time rather than its absolute level. A modest but persistent IC with reasonable turnover is far more trustworthy than a volatile, spike-driven profile. Turnover and capacity come slightly later for me, because they can often be shaped with execution-aware adjustments, whereas instability in signal logic cannot. In short, my first test is:  *does this alpha still make sense when I nudge it?*  If the answer is no, no downstream metric will rescue it.

Thank you for raising this question—it reflects a level of research maturity that many people only reach after some hard lessons. I really resonate with your observation that modest but stable signals tend to survive longer than flashy ones. That shift in perspective—from chasing standout metrics to valuing durability—is a meaningful turning point in alpha research.

I also appreciate how you framed the question around  *trust* . Metrics are abundant, but deciding which ones deserve confidence early on is the real challenge. Discussions like this help normalize the idea that validation is a process, not a scoreboard. Hearing how others prioritize checks encourages more disciplined and patient research habits across the community. Thanks for inviting these insights—it’s a genuinely helpful topic for anyone trying to move from experimentation toward production-quality alphas.

My first priority is evaluating stability—looking at how consistently IC behaves over time and across different subperiods. If a signal lacks stability, metrics like Sharpe and returns can be deceptive. Only after stability is established do I focus on turnover and capacity considerations.

I prioritize stability first—checking IC consistency over time and subperiods. Without stability, Sharpe and returns can mislead. Turnover and capacity come after stability is confirmed.
