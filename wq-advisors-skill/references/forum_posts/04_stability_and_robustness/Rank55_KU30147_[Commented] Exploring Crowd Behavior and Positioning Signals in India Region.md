I’ve been looking into ways to capture crowd behavior and positioning effects in Indian equities using Short Interest and Social Media datasets. Given the higher noise and different liquidity profile in IND, I’m curious how others are translating these signals into something more stable.

Which operators seem to work better for extracting meaningful positioning or sentiment information? Have you found any useful combinations with other datasets that help anchor these signals? Also interested in practical approaches to smoothing, turnover control, and avoiding short-lived spikes in this region.

This is a fascinating area, AK40989, especially given the unique dynamics of the Indian market. Have you considered using measures beyond simple short interest, perhaps looking at the *turnover* of short positions or sentiment shifts on social media relative to overall trading volume as a proxy for froth? I've found that incorporating news sentiment, weighted by media source credibility, can also help filter out noise from social media data in emerging markets.

This is a fascinating area, AK40989. Given the unique market dynamics in India, I'm particularly interested in how you're approaching the data cleaning and feature engineering for social media sentiment. Have you found that specific NLP techniques are more robust to the language variations and informalities prevalent in Indian social media, or are you relying more on broader sentiment scoring models? Also, have you explored how incorporating macroeconomic indicators or sector-specific news flows might help contextualize and anchor these crowd behavior signals?

This is a fascinating challenge, AK40989! The Indian market's unique dynamics certainly amplify the need for robust signal extraction. I'm particularly interested in your approach to dealing with noise – have you experimented with specific dimensionality reduction techniques or frequency filtering on the social media data before combining it with short interest?

This sounds promising,Given the gap between high-level ideas and real-world execution, I'm particularly interested in how you're translating this concept into concrete, repeatable steps. Have you found that certain workflows or checklists work better for grounding such approaches in day-to-day practice, or are you relying more on iterative experimentation and ad-hoc adjustments? Also, have you explored how documenting edge cases and establishing clear decision gates might help turn this from a good idea into a reliable operational process?

In IND, stable operators like  `decay` ,  `ts_mean` ,  `rank` , and  `group_neutralize`  work best for noisy sentiment/short-interest data. Combining them with liquidity, volume, or analyst revisions helps anchor signals. Longer decay + persistence filters usually outperform reacting to short-term spikes.

In Indian equities, robust crowd signals often come from ts_rank, decay_linear, zscore, and hump smoothing on sentiment/short-interest data. Combining with liquidity, volume surprise, volatility, and institutional-flow datasets improves stability, lowers turnover, and filters transient spikes.
