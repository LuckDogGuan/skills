Option data refers to the information related to financial options, which are contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset (such as a stock) at a predetermined price (strike price) before or on a specific date (expiration date).It is used by traders and analysts to make informed decisions about option trading strategies, hedging, and risk management. It provides insights into market sentiment, potential price movements, and the relative value of options.

### 1.  **Volatility Arbitrage**

**Hypothesis** : If a stock's implied volatility is significantly higher than its historical volatility, the stock price may increase.  **Implementation** : Long the stock if its implied volatility (from a 120-day call option) significantly exceeds its historical volatility (Parkinson's volatility).

### 2.  **Momentum After News**

**Hypothesis** : Stocks that take longer to rise after news is released may show strong evidence of upward momentum.

### 3.  **EBIT vs. CapEx**

**Hypothesis** : Stocks with higher EBIT compared to CapEx may not be investing much in growth, and the stock may not grow as much.  **Implementation** : Compare CapEx with EBIT and short stocks with inadequate CapEx.

### 4.  **Future Investment and Dividend**

**Hypothesis** : Retained earnings are an indicator of the capability of future investment and dividend.  **Implementation** : Use sharesout to normalize the amount of retained earnings and apply  `ts_delta()`  to capture the change of the ratio over the last three months.

### 5.  **Price Reversion**

**Hypothesis** : Stocks that deviate significantly from their moving average may revert to the mean.  **Implementation** : Calculate the 30-day simple moving average (SMA) and rank stocks based on the difference between SMA and the current price.

### 6.  **Volume and Price Difference**

**Hypothesis** : If the volume is larger than the 20-day average, trade based on the price difference of the last 5 days.  **Implementation** : Use  `ts_delta(close, 5)`  to capture the price difference and  `trade_when(event, alpha, -1)`  to activate trading.

These are just a few ideas to get you started. You can experiment with different operators and parameters to refine your strategies and improve performance. Happy alpha hunting!

**Volatility Arbitrage** : This strategy aims to profit from discrepancies between implied and historical volatility. By taking a long position in the stock when implied volatility (from a call option) exceeds historical volatility (such as Parkinson's volatility), you're betting that the stock price will move to correct this disparity.

An important factor in seeking alpha from options data is Gamma Exposure (GEX). When market makers need to delta hedge their positions, stock price volatility can either be amplified or suppressed. If total gamma in the market is high, stock prices tend to fluctuate within a narrow range due to balancing forces from hedging. Conversely, when gamma is low or negative, volatility can increase significantly. Monitoring GEX can help identify key price levels, anticipate sudden market moves, and optimize trading strategies based on options driven volatility.

- This way, you're only making trades when both price and sentiment are favorable, reducing noise from external factors.
- **if_else for Dynamic Thresholds** : If you're working with various assets or strategies, you might want dynamic thresholds for your conditions. Using  `if_else` , you can set different conditions based on asset type, volatility, or market conditions. For example:

Volatility Arbitrage is a strategy designed to capitalize on the differences between implied and historical volatility. Essentially, when a stock’s implied volatility (derived from its call options) exceeds its historical volatility (such as Parkinson's volatility), the strategy involves taking a long position. This approach is based on the expectation that the stock price will eventually adjust, narrowing the gap between these two volatility measures.

To further enhance the alpha, you can set up exit conditions that trigger when the market starts moving unfavorably or when noise levels become too high. This could involve setting a stop loss, trailing stop, or even using momentum reversal signals.

Great set of strategies! One way to refine volatility arbitrage further is by incorporating skew analysis, monitoring how implied volatility varies across different strike prices. This can help identify mispricing opportunities in the options market before they reflect in the stock price.

Gamma Exposure (GEX) is key to extracting alpha from options data. High GEX stabilizes prices through hedging, while low or negative GEX increases volatility. Monitoring GEX helps identify key levels, anticipate market moves, and optimize options-driven trading strategies.

- **Strike Price** : The predetermined price at which the holder of the option can buy or sell the underlying asset.
- **Expiration Date** : The date on which the option expires and can no longer be exercised.
- **Implied Volatility (IV)** : A measure of the market’s expectations for volatility in the underlying asset's price. Higher IV typically indicates higher option premiums.

Option data provides valuable insights for trading strategies, particularly in volatility arbitrage, momentum-based signals, and mean reversion. Strategies such as using implied volatility vs. historical volatility (e.g., Parkinson's volatility) can help identify mispricing opportunities. Additionally, incorporating Gamma Exposure (GEX) can provide a better understanding of market-maker hedging effects on stock price stability and volatility.

**Price reversion is a classic strategy, but adding volume analysis could enhance it.**  For example, a stock trading far from its moving average with increasing volume might indicate strong momentum instead of mean reversion. Would love to see if someone can test these and add results.

The EBIT vs. CapEx approach is insightful for fundamental-driven alpha, but adding a return-on-invested-capital (ROIC) filter could improve signal quality. Companies with consistently low CapEx but high ROIC may be optimizing capital efficiency rather than underinvesting.

Gamma Exposure (GEX) plays a crucial role in extracting alpha from options data by affecting stock price volatility. When market makers hedge their positions, the impact of GEX can either dampen or amplify stock price fluctuations. A high gamma environment generally stabilizes prices within a narrow range due to the balancing effects of hedging, while a low or negative gamma environment can cause significant price swings. By monitoring GEX, traders can identify key price levels and anticipate sharp market movements, making it a useful tool for optimizing strategies that rely on options-driven volatility.

Volatility Arbitrage capitalizes on the discrepancies between implied and historical volatility. When implied volatility (derived from options pricing) exceeds historical volatility (e.g., Parkinson’s volatility), the strategy typically takes a long position in anticipation that the price will adjust to close this gap. To improve alpha, traders can incorporate exit conditions like stop-losses or trailing stops and use momentum reversal signals to cut losses during unfavorable market conditions.

Have you experimented with any specific tools or indicators to enhance GEX-based strategies?
