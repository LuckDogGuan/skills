**Tips for getting started with  [Earnings](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets?category=earnings)  Datasets:**

- The 'Earnings' data category provides information on company performance and market expectations, including analyst estimates vs. actual earnings, financial report timings, and corporate event schedules.
- Backfilling with ts_backfill() may be necessary due to irregular reporting dates across different companies.
- The data category primarily includes fields linked to a company's fundamental data reporting, often associated with lower turnover.

**Example Alpha Ideas:**

- Companies that report earnings higher than what analysts have predicted typically see a surge in their stock prices. Investors can buy these stocks before the market has fully priced in the information.
- Capitalize on the Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD) effect by going long on stocks that have high Standardized Unexpected Earnings and positive Earnings Announcement Return, indicating a strong positive response to earnings announcement.
- After a company announces disappointing earnings, its stock price often drops. However, these drops can sometimes be overreactions, and the stock may rebound in the future.

**Recommended Datasets:**

- [Actuals and Estimates Earnings Data](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/earnings1)
- [Earnings Date Data](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/earnings3)
- [Effect of earnings announcement model](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/data/data-sets/earnings4)

Earnings data provides powerful insights into market expectations and company performance. By using it effectively, one can develop alpha strategies that capitalize on earnings surprises. For example, buying stocks after they report earnings higher than analysts' expectations can lead to profitable returns, as the market often takes time to fully price in the news. The Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD) effect is another great opportunity, as stocks may continue to trend in the direction of the earnings surprise for days or even weeks. This dataset is a solid foundation for building event-driven strategies.

Hello, I noticed that the earning data set has some data that really gives very strong signals, however in recent years pnl has been flat. I would like to ask how to fix this situation.

It's great that you're noticing strong signals in the earnings dataset. Regarding the flat P&L in recent years, it might be worth looking into refining your alpha strategy by incorporating additional filters or adjusting the risk management framework.

After a company announces earnings, observe how the market reacts. Some price movements can be overreactions, especially in the short term. Analyzing Earnings Announcement Returns (EAR) can help identify whether a price drop or increase is likely to continue or reverse.

- **Analyst Estimates** : Expected earnings per share (EPS) as predicted by market analysts.
- **Actual Earnings** : The actual EPS that a company reports.
- **Earnings Surprises** : The difference between expected and actual earnings.
- **Earnings Timings** : Dates when earnings reports are scheduled to be released.
- **Corporate Events** : Information on events such as earnings calls, guidance updates, and other important company announcements.

Great insights! I agree that earnings surprises can have a significant impact on stock prices, especially when analysts' expectations are beaten. I like the idea of using the Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD) effect to go long on stocks with high Standardized Unexpected Earnings and positive responses. Also, backfilling with  `ts_backfill()`  to handle irregular reporting dates seems like an essential step. Thanks for sharing the useful tips and recommended datasets!

**Getting Started with Earnings Datasets**

Earnings datasets provide valuable insights into a company's financial health, performance, and growth prospects. These datasets often include earnings reports, earnings estimates, earnings growth, and other key financial metrics related to a company's income and profit.

**Key Elements of Earnings Datasets:**

1. **Earnings Per Share (EPS)** :
   - A critical indicator of a company's profitability, representing the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock.
   - Can be reported as actual EPS, estimated EPS, or forecasted EPS.
2. **Earnings Growth** :
   - Tracks the growth in earnings over a period, often measured on a year-over-year (YoY) or quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) basis.
   - Important for evaluating a company's expansion potential.
3. **Revenue and Sales** :
   - Revenue is the total income generated from business activities, which is a fundamental metric for evaluating a company's market performance.
4. **Earnings Estimates** :
   - Analysts' forecasts for a company's earnings in upcoming quarters or fiscal years.
   - Can be used to assess how well the company is expected to perform relative to expectations.
5. **Earnings Surprise** :
   - Occurs when a company reports earnings that are significantly above or below analysts' expectations.
   - Important for determining market sentiment and volatility.

**How to Use Earnings Datasets:**

1. **Compare Actual Earnings with Estimates** :
   - Use earnings surprise (actual vs. expected earnings) to gauge market reaction. A positive surprise can lead to stock price appreciation, while a negative one may cause a decline.
2. **Assess Earnings Growth** :
   - Focus on companies with strong earnings growth, especially if it’s above industry or market expectations. This can be used to identify growth stocks.
3. **Create Alphas Using Earnings Data** :
   - Use metrics like earnings growth, surprises, or analyst revisions to create predictive models (Alphas) for stock price movements.
   - You can combine earnings growth with other factors like valuation (P/E ratio) or momentum.
4. **Neutralizing Earnings Data** :
   - If you’re focusing on sector-specific earnings data, you can use neutralization techniques like  `group_neutralize`  to adjust for sector or country biases.

**Example Alpha Ideas** :

- **Earnings Surprises** : Create an Alpha that goes long on stocks with a positive earnings surprise and short on those with a negative one.
- **Earnings Growth vs. Price Performance** : Compare earnings growth with stock price performance to predict future stock movements.
- **Earnings Estimates Revision** : When analysts revise earnings estimates upward, it can be a bullish signal. Consider going long on stocks with upward earnings estimate revisions.

**Recommended Datasets** :

- **Quarterly Earnings Reports** : Actual earnings data, revenue, and EPS.
- **Earnings Forecasts** : Analyst expectations and growth projections.
- **Earnings Surprises** : Comparison of actual earnings against estimates.
- **Historical Earnings Growth** : Historical trends in earnings growth over time.

Thanks for your guidance. Especially the specific suggestions for useful Datasets helped me save a lot of time exploring Alphas in this new area. 
I have one question: Besides _backfill, what other Operators does the Earnings Dataset usually combine well with? The reason is I've tried many Operators with Earnings but the results haven't been very good.

### 评论 #11 (作者: AB15407, 时间: 1年前)

I'm also having difficulties applying ideas based on Earnings Datasets. 
Recently, my PNL based on them hasn't been very good. 
Does anyone have any suggestions for this issue?

The  **Earnings**  data category offers rich insights into company performance and market expectations, often linked to fundamental data reporting with lower turnover. Here's how to maximize its potential:

1. **Data Management** :
   - Use  **ts_backfill()**  to address irregular reporting dates across companies, ensuring consistent coverage and robust analysis.
2. **Example Alpha Ideas** :
   - **Earnings Surprises** : Buy stocks that report earnings exceeding analyst estimates before the market fully prices in the news.
   - **Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD)** : Go long on stocks with high  **Standardized Unexpected Earnings (SUE)**  and strong  **Earnings Announcement Returns** , as these often indicate positive momentum.
   - **Overreaction to Negative Earnings** : Identify stocks that drop excessively after disappointing earnings, as they may rebound once the market corrects the overreaction.

By leveraging these strategies, earnings data can serve as a powerful tool for generating impactful alphas.

To optimize portfolio returns in relation to the risk taken (i.e., improving the Sharpe ratio), investors can apply risk neutralization strategies. These strategies help reduce exposure to certain risks, thus enhancing the risk-adjusted return, which is the core idea behind the Sharpe ratio.

### 评论 #15 (作者: RB20756, 时间: 1年前)

Earnings surprises and the Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD) offer great alpha potential. Focus on stocks with positive Standardized Unexpected Earnings and market overreactions. Refine strategies with filters, risk adjustments, and handle irregular reports via backfilling.

Regarding the Earnings dataset, are there any suggestions for data operations (OPs) besides ts_backfill? 
Additionally, I'm also interested in datasets that could be combined with the Earnings dataset, other than PV1. 
I'd appreciate any further insights you all might have.

### 评论 #18 (作者: AB15407, 时间: 1年前)

This is the dataset for which I have the least alpha. I hope to receive further guidance from experienced consultants on generating alpha from it.

### 评论 #19 (作者: SC43474, 时间: 1年前)

Earnings datasets offer a wealth of opportunities, but effectively harnessing their potential requires a combination of creativity and precision. One often underexplored angle is analyzing sector-specific patterns in earnings surprises. For instance, certain industries may exhibit more pronounced post-earnings drift or quicker price corrections. By integrating sector momentum or macroeconomic indicators with earnings data, you can refine your alpha strategies further. Additionally, incorporating machine learning models to detect non-linear relationships in earnings reactions might unlock hidden opportunities. Remember, consistent backtesting and adapting to market dynamics are key to staying ahead.

This post provides a great overview of how to navigate Earnings Datasets, particularly the importance of understanding the discrepancies between analyst estimates and actual earnings. I'm curious about the strategies for identifying companies that might rebound after a negative earnings report. Do you have any specific approaches for spotting these potential opportunities?

1. Go long on companies that report earnings higher than what analysts have predicted.
2. Go long on stocks with high Standardized Unexpected Earnings (SUE) and positive Earnings Announcement Return (EAR).
3. Go long on companies whose stock prices have dropped excessively after announcing disappointing earnings.
