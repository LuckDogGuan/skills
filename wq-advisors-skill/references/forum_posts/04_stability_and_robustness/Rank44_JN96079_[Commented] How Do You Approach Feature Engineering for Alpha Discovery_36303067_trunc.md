Do you start from raw datasets and transform them using operators like  `ts_rank` ,  `delta` , and  `corr` , or do you rely more on pre-engineered analytics data? How do you decide when a feature transformation adds true predictive value versus just cosmetic complexity?

I usually combine raw fields with simple transformations to reveal structure, but try to avoid adding complexity unless it clearly improves stability or predictive power.

Please more ideas on this will be very helpful

I usually start with raw datasets so I can control the transformations,ts_rank, delta, corr, etc and only switch to analytics data when I need stability or cleaner fundamentals.

I typically pair raw fields with simple transformations to uncover structure, but I avoid adding extra complexity unless it meaningfully boosts stability or predictive power.

My default is using unprocessed data so I can manually handle all math and ranking. I only move over to curated datasets when I want more stable signals or filtered financial information

My approach to feature engineering usually starts with raw datasets, because they give the most transparency and control over what information is actually entering the alpha. I like to begin with very simple transformations such as  `ts_rank` ,  `delta` , moving averages, or basic correlations, and then observe how the signal behaves across IS and OS. The key test for me is whether a transformation improves  *stability* , not just headline Sharpe. If adding an operator reduces turnover volatility, improves decay robustness, or stabilizes IC over time, then it is likely adding real predictive structure. On the other hand, if a transformation only boosts IS Sharpe but worsens OS behavior or increases sensitivity to small parameter changes, it’s usually cosmetic complexity. Pre-engineered analytics data can be useful when I want cleaner fundamentals or more stable signals, but I still prefer to layer simple transformations on top so I understand exactly why the alpha works and where it might fail.

I usually start with raw, unprocessed data. I switch to curated datasets only when I need cleaner, more stable signals or pre-filtered financial information.

My usual approach is to start with raw data and apply only straightforward transformations to reveal the underlying signal. I only introduce additional layers of complexity when they clearly improve robustness or add genuine forecasting value, rather than complexity for its own sake.
