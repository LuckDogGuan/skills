The  `power(x,y)`  operator can be tempting, especially with y>1 to emphasize outliers. Example:

`power(ts_delta(price,5), 2)
`

This magnified strong price moves, but often overfitted to rare spikes. Out-of-sample, performance collapsed.

Safer trick:

`signed_power(signal, 0.5)
`

compresses noise while keeping directionality.

Lesson:  **Power amplifies risk** . Use it sparingly, and mostly with y<1 for robustness.

👉 Question: Have you found practical OS success with y>1 power transforms, or is it mostly curve-fitting?

Good point. In my tests, using power with y>1 usually created signals that looked strong in-sample but failed to carry over out-of-sample. Sublinear transforms like signed_power with exponents below 1 tend to be more robust, especially when handling noisy inputs. For me, y>1 feels more like curve-fitting than a reliable source of edge.

Great callout on power()’s overfitting risk—totally felt that pain! I’ve never had consistent OS success with y>1—any alpha using power(ts_delta(...), 2) or higher would crush IS (thanks to magnifying rare spikes) but tank OS, since those one-off moves never repeat.

signed_power(..., 0.5) is my go-to now too—it softens noise without killing direction, way more robust. The only time I’ve  *barely*  made y>1 work is pairing it with super strict filters (e.g., only applying power(2) if the signal’s z-score < 1.5, to avoid amplifying extreme outliers), but even then, OS performance was spotty.

In my experience,  **power with y>1 rarely holds up out-of-sample**  — it tends to exaggerate rare events and ends up fitting noise rather than persistent structure. While it can look great in-sample by capturing dramatic spikes, the predictive edge usually vanishes once market regimes shift.

Where I’ve seen more consistent value is with  **y<1 transforms**  (e.g.,  `signed_power(signal, 0.5)` ), which dampen extreme values, reduce noise, and improve robustness across universes. These forms tend to stabilize the signal rather than amplify risk.

So for me,  `power(y>1)`  has been more of a  **curve-fitting trap** , while  `power(y<1)`  works as a reliable denoiser. Curious if anyone has a real OS example where amplification (y>1) actually delivered sustained value.
