#### **Signal Concept**

**Core Hypothesis** : Earnings surprises create momentum effects in stock prices, which propagate across related stocks within the same sector or supply chain. Capturing the relationship between earnings surprises and subsequent price momentum can uncover latent opportunities.

#### **Alpha Signal Framework** :

1. **Earnings Surprise Analysis** :
   - Use data fields like  **earnings per share (EPS)** ,  **surprise percentage** , or  **earnings growth**  to detect deviations from analyst expectations.
2. **Momentum Capture** :
   - Employ momentum-based operators such as  `ts_delta`  or  `ts_decay_exp_window`  to measure price movements following earnings announcements.
3. **Sectoral Impact** :
   - Utilize operators like  `group_zscore`  or  `group_mean`  to normalize the signal within a sector or peer group.
4. **Cross-Sector Propagation** :
   - Use correlation operators like  `ts_corr`  or  `group_coalesce`  to identify relationships between earnings surprises in one sector and performance in related sectors.

#### **Example Alpha Expression** :

`alpha = ts_decay_exp_window(group_zscore(earnings_surprise, sector) * ts_delta(price, 20), 10, 0.8)
`

This Alpha leverages earnings surprise signals and momentum operators to capture price reactions while normalizing for sectoral variations. It also considers the potential propagation of surprises across sectors, enriching the signal's predictive power.

Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback!

Thank you for sharing the idea! The alpha effectively utilizes operators like  `group_zscore`  to normalize signals within sectors,  `ts_delta`  to measure short-term price momentum, and  `ts_decay_exp_window`  to prioritize reactions closer to the earnings announcement. To enhance it, you could add  `group_neutralize`  to remove sector specific effects and  `ts_corr`  to capture cross-sector relationships, improving accuracy and real-world applicability.

When a company reports  **earnings surprises** —better or worse than expected results—it often causes its  **stock price**  to move significantly. These moves can create a  **ripple effect** , influencing the prices of other stocks in the same  **sector**  or  **supply chain** . By understanding how these  **earnings surprises**  lead to  **price momentum** , investors can spot  **opportunities**  that might not be immediately obvious. This approach helps uncover  **trends**  and  **connections**  that others might miss, giving you an  **edge**  in finding stocks that could be ready to move.

Surprises, especially earnings surprises, can have a significant impact on stock prices.

1. **Positive Surprises** : When a company reports earnings that exceed analysts' expectations by 5% or more, it often leads to an immediate increase in the stock price, typically ranging from 2-10%. This positive reaction can continue to influence stock performance for up to 60-90 days.
2. **Negative Surprises** : Conversely, when a company reports earnings below analysts' expectations, it can trigger a decline in the stock price, often ranging from 5-15% within 24 hours. Negative surprises can also affect stock performance over a longer period, but usually not as positively as positive surprises.
3. **Market Sentiment** : Surprises can significantly influence market sentiment. Positive surprises can boost investor confidence and attract more buyers, while negative surprises can lead to selling pressure and a decrease in investor confidence.
4. **Sector Variations** : Different sectors may show varying patterns in response to earnings surprises. For example, technology companies often experience more positive surprises compared to utilities, which tend to have more consistent earnings.
5. **Trading Strategies** : Investors often develop strategies around earnings surprises, such as pre-announcement positioning (trading 5-10 days before the announcement) and post-earnings drift trading (trading 30-60 days after the announcement).

Understanding how surprises affect stock prices can provide valuable insights for developing investment strategies.

### 评论 #65 (作者: VP87972, 时间: 1年前)

This approach offers a robust framework for analyzing the impacts of earnings surprises on stock prices through a well-structured sequence of analytical steps.

---

### 评论 #66 (作者: SK26283, 时间: 1年前)

#### 

1. **Earnings Surprise:**
   - Measures the difference between actual earnings and expected earnings. Positive surprises often lead to stock price increases, while negative surprises can cause declines.
   - **Approach:**   `ts_delta(EarningsReported, EarningsExpected)`  (To calculate the earnings surprise)
2. **Momentum Dynamics:**
   - Captures the trend in stock prices over a specified period. Stocks with strong positive momentum are likely to continue performing well.
   - **Approach:**   `ts_delta(Close, N)`  (N is the number of days to calculate momentum)
3. **Alpha Idea : r** ank(zscore(ts_mean(EarningsSurprise, 5))) + rank(ts_delta(Close, 1))
   This idea combines the ranking of normalized earnings surprises over a 5-day period with the momentum of stock prices over the past day.
   By leveraging these operators, you can create sophisticated alphas that capture both earnings surprises and momentum dynamics, enhancing your trading strategies.

Hi  [LN78195](/hc/en-us/profiles/4647202315159-LN78195) ,

Great breakdown of earnings surprise momentum! The integration of sectoral normalization, momentum capture, and cross-sector propagation makes this alpha idea both insightful and practical.

---

### 评论 #72 (作者: SK26283, 时间: 1年前)

The post is incredibly insightful and well-structured! The idea that earnings surprises create momentum effects in stock prices, which then propagate across related stocks within the same sector or supply chain, is very compelling.

I have a couple of questions about the implementation:

1. When you mention using earnings per share (EPS) and surprise percentage for the Earnings Surprise Analysis, how do you handle outliers or extreme values? Do you apply any specific filtering or normalization techniques?
2. For the Momentum Capture phase, have you considered the impact of earnings announcements timing (pre-market, post-market, etc.) on the momentum effects? If so, how do you adjust for these timing differences in your model?
3. In the Sectoral Impact section, you suggest normalizing the signal within a sector. Do you use a specific timeframe for this normalization, and how do you determine the most appropriate period?
4. Regarding Cross-Sector Propagation, how do you handle sectors with weaker correlations? Do you apply any weighting schemes or threshold criteria to focus on stronger relationships?

Looking forward to your insights on these points!
