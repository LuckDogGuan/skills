Hi everyone,
One pattern I’ve noticed is that some of my  **simplest alphas**  end up surviving longer than more complex ones with higher IS Sharpe. A few observations:

•  **Complexity increases fragility** 
Stacking many nonlinear or heavy TS operators often boosts IS results, but small data or regime changes can quickly break the signal.

•  **Robust alphas tolerate imperfection** 
If an alpha only works under very specific parameters, it’s usually overfit. Signals that remain reasonable across nearby settings tend to generalize better.

•  **Cross-sectional strength beats time-series cleverness** 
Clean cross-sectional ranking often delivers more stable performance than intricate timing logic.

•  **Interpretability helps iteration** 
When you understand  *why*  an alpha works, it’s much easier to fix or adapt it when performance degrades.

These lessons pushed me to favor clarity and robustness over squeezing out maximum Sharpe.

Curious if others have had similar experiences or different conclusions.

I’ve noticed the same pattern. Complex alphas often achieve higher in-sample Sharpe because they can fit subtle patterns, but this also makes them more prone to overfitting and less stable out of sample. Simpler alphas may look weaker in-sample, yet they usually rely on more robust effects and tolerate regime changes better. From an out-of-sample perspective, complexity often trades short-term performance for fragility, while simpler signals tend to survive longer and integrate more reliably into a portfolio.

Yes they do . simpler alphas often outlive complex, high-IS Sharpe ones. Complexity adds fragility; small regime shifts break them. Robust signals tolerate parameter noise, rely on clean cross-sectional strength, and remain interpretable. Clarity makes iteration easier and durability higher than aggressively optimized Sharpe.

yes right. This mirrors what many teams see in production:  **simplicity and robustness tend to dominate raw IS Sharpe**  over time. Complex constructions often monetize noise, while alphas that are stable across parameters, interpretable, and cross-sectionally driven adapt better to regime change and are easier to maintain. Prioritizing clarity over marginal Sharpe is usually a sign of a mature research process.

This is essentially a degrees of freedom problem. Every time we add a complex operator, we expand the search space and increase the probability of a false discovery. Simplicity isn't just aesthetic; it’s a statistical safety belt against p-hacking your own backtest.

Great observations! I've noticed similar patterns in my own work - simpler alphas do tend to have longer lifespans than complex ones. This reminds me of Occam's razor principle - when everything else is equal, the simplest solution is often the best.

In my practice, I've also found a related point: the economic logic behind the data field matters more than complex calculations. For example, a factor based on a simple value ratio is often more stable than one containing multiple time-series operations.

At its core, this is a matter of degrees of freedom. Each additional complex operator widens the search space and raises the chance of stumbling onto spurious results. Keeping the design simple isn’t just about elegance—it acts as a statistical safeguard, helping prevent inadvertent p-hacking of your own backtests.
