Lately, I’ve been exploring the implied volatility spread call IV minus put IV  as a potential alpha signal. The thesis is straightforward: when call IV runs significantly above put IV, it tends to reflect bullish sentiment, and the reverse when it's the other way around.

To make the signal more stable, I've been applying the rank operator to normalise values across the stock universe, which helps strip out scale differences and makes the output more comparable.

I’d welcome any feedback on how to further strengthen the robustness of this approach  particularly around reducing noise and improving consistency across changing market regimes.

You can also use different datafields or operators to express the same idea and diversify your alpha pool.

Interesting idea — using the call-put IV spread as a sentiment signal makes intuitive sense. To improve robustness across regimes, you could try applying a longer-term  `ts_zscore`  or  `ts_rank`  relative to each stock’s own history, rather than just cross-sectional rank. Also testing different lookbacks for the spread calculation might help reduce noise.
