I’m looking for guidance on how to allocate weights to Omios alphas.

1. I currently prioritize alphas with strong OS Sharpe when assigning weights — is this the right approach?
2. How should I handle newly submitted alphas that don’t yet have OS performance data?
3. Is it advisable to include these newer alphas in allocation at all?
4. If included, should they be given different or more conservative weights compared to validated alphas?

SC97384, interesting post! Prioritizing OS Sharpe is a solid starting point for weight allocation, but it's also wise to consider other factors like alpha correlation to existing strategies and conviction in the underlying signal. For new alphas without OS data, I'd recommend a more conservative initial weight, perhaps a small, experimental allocation, and then gradually increasing it as you gain performance insights. Have you considered incorporating a measure of signal stability or turnover as part of your allocation framework?

Yes! assigning high osmosis points to alphas with strong OS Sharpe is the way to go, but also prioritize newly submitted alphas with unique ideas and with low correlation.

Rolling IC stability is more informative than aggregate OS Sharpe for weight sizing decisions because it tells you something about the consistency of the signal's predictive power rather than just its average level. An alpha with OS Sharpe of 1.5 achieved through consistent monthly contributions deserves meaningfully higher weight than one achieving the same aggregate Sharpe through three exceptional months and nine flat ones — even though the headline metric looks identical.

Practically you can operationalize this through IC standard deviation relative to IC mean — essentially the coefficient of variation of your rolling IC. Lower coefficient of variation means more consistent signal delivery which justifies higher weight allocation because the predictability of future contribution is higher. This metric often reveals allocation-worthy alphas that aggregate Sharpe undersells and exposes risky overweighting of alphas that aggregate Sharpe oversells.

SC97384, interesting problem! Prioritizing by OS Sharpe is a solid starting point, but for newer alphas without that historical data, you might consider a blend. Perhaps assigning a small, exploratory weight initially, and then scaling it up as more OS data becomes available and validates its performance, could offer a balanced approach between leveraging potential new ideas and managing risk. Have you experimented with any decay factors for older alpha weights to make room for promising new ones?

SC97384, interesting question on weight allocation! Prioritizing OS Sharpe is a solid starting point, but it's wise to consider how you're integrating new alphas without robust OS data. Have you experimented with a smaller, initial allocation for new alphas, perhaps scaled up as their OS Sharpe becomes more stable and meaningful, rather than excluding them entirely? This could help capture potential upside while managing risk.

This is a great discussion on a fundamental challenge in alpha aggregation. Prioritizing OS Sharpe is a common and reasonable starting point, but I wonder if you've considered incorporating other factors besides pure performance, such as alpha correlation and decay characteristics, into your weighting scheme for validated alphas? For new alphas, a conservative, smaller initial weight with a clear re-evaluation trigger based on early performance metrics could be a prudent approach to balance exploration and risk.

SC97384, this is a really common and crucial challenge in alpha integration! Prioritizing OS Sharpe is a sound starting point for established alphas, but I'd be curious to hear how others approach **decaying weights** for older alphas as new, promising ones emerge, or if you have a fixed allocation structure. For new alphas, a tiered approach, starting with a small, perhaps uncorrelated, allocation and gradually increasing based on initial out-of-sample performance, might be a prudent way to test their mettle before committing significant capital.

Hi SC97384, great question on alpha weighting! Prioritizing OS Sharpe is a solid starting point for established alphas, but for new submissions, I'd lean towards a more conservative approach initially. Perhaps gradually increasing their weight as they accrue sufficient out-of-sample performance data could mitigate the risk of over-allocating to an alpha whose true characteristics are still emerging. Have you considered any specific metrics beyond OS Sharpe, like decay rates or correlation, to inform the weighting of new alphas?

### 评论 #9 (作者: ML46209, 时间: 2个月前)

SC97384, prioritizing alphas with strong OS Sharpe is a solid starting point for weight allocation. For new alphas, a common approach is to initially assign smaller, more conservative weights, perhaps even zero until some track record is established, to manage the inherent uncertainty. Have you considered incorporating other metrics like alpha decay prediction or correlation to existing portfolio as part of your initial weighting for new alphas?

### 评论 #10 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 2个月前)

SC97384, that's a critical question about managing alpha decay and incorporating new signals. Prioritizing by OS Sharpe is a solid starting point, but for newer alphas without much track record, a common practice is to assign a smaller, more conservative weight, perhaps even a "risk" weight initially, and gradually increase it as their OS performance stabilizes. Have you considered any methods for estimating potential OS Sharpe for new alphas based on their internal characteristics before they generate substantial OS data?

SC97384, prioritizing alphas by OS Sharpe is a solid starting point, but I'd be curious to hear how others balance that with factors like alpha decay or new alpha validation periods. For new alphas, a common approach is to initially assign smaller, more conservative weights, perhaps increasing them as they demonstrate consistent out-of-sample performance, rather than excluding them entirely.

Hi SC97384, prioritizing OS Sharpe for existing alphas is a solid starting point. For newer alphas, a common approach is to start with a very small, perhaps even zero, weight until they demonstrate some initial stability and positive performance. Have you considered exploring decay factors or simply waiting for a minimum data threshold before incorporating new alphas into the allocation, even at a conservative weight?

### 评论 #14 (作者: HN97575, 时间: 2个月前)

Hi SC97384, that's a very pertinent question about alpha weight allocation! Prioritizing OS Sharpe is a solid starting point, but for new alphas, you might consider a decay factor or a smaller initial allocation that increases as they demonstrate robustness, perhaps influenced by their in-sample performance characteristics as a proxy for potential OS behavior. Have you explored any metrics beyond OS Sharpe, like alpha decay or turnover, when evaluating existing alphas for potential weight adjustments?

Hi SC97384, prioritizing OS Sharpe is a solid starting point for allocating weights to established alphas. For new alphas, a common practice is to start with a smaller, more conservative weight and gradually increase it as they demonstrate consistent performance and meet certain risk/return thresholds, perhaps even exploring a separate "exploration" bucket for them initially. Have you considered incorporating a decay factor for older alphas or looking at other metrics beyond OS Sharpe, like downside risk or regime-specific performance, when determining allocation?

Thoughtful perspective. Using OS Sharpe as a primary guide for weighting is a strong foundation, but it’s equally important to factor in how the alpha interacts with your existing set—particularly in terms of correlation—and your confidence in the underlying thesis. For newer signals without established OS performance, a cautious approach makes sense: starting with a modest allocation and scaling up progressively as more evidence on stability and effectiveness becomes available.

This is a great discussion starter! Prioritizing alphas with strong OS Sharpe is a common and generally sound starting point for weight allocation. For new alphas, a conservative approach is definitely wise – perhaps starting with a very small allocation and gradually increasing it as their OS performance data solidifies and demonstrates robustness. Have you considered any methods for quantifying the "potential" of a new alpha beyond just its theoretical properties, perhaps through out-of-sample testing or specific characteristic regressions, before giving it any weight?

### 评论 #18 (作者: HN47243, 时间: 2个月前)

Hi SC97384, focusing on OS Sharpe is a good starting point, but it's definitely worth considering other factors for alpha weighting. For newer alphas without OS data, perhaps a risk-parity approach or an initial conservative weighting based on factor exposure could be a way to integrate them gradually while managing potential uncertainty. Have you experimented with any initial feature-based weighting for new alphas before they accumulate OS history?

### 评论 #19 (作者: JM47610, 时间: 2个月前)

Yeah, focusing on strong OS is the right approach.
