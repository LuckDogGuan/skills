While Sharpe is commonly used, I’ve found cases where high Sharpe alphas fail other robustness
checks. Which additional metrics do you trust most for evaluating alpha quality, such as
drawdown behavior, ladder Sharpe, or turnover stability?

This is an important question because relying on Sharpe alone can be misleading in alpha evaluation on  **WorldQuant Brain** . Sharpe is a useful summary statistic, but it compresses a lot of information and often hides instability. Personally, one of the first metrics I look at is  **subperiod or ladder Sharpe** , which shows whether performance is evenly distributed over time or driven by a narrow window. Alphas with consistent ladder Sharpe tend to be far more reliable in pooled environments.

Turnover stability is another key metric. A signal with acceptable average turnover but large spikes is often fragile and cost-sensitive. I also pay close attention to  **drawdown structure**  rather than just maximum drawdown—long, slow recoveries usually indicate structural weakness. Coverage consistency and IC decay are also informative; alphas that rely on shrinking coverage or rapidly decaying IC often struggle out of sample. Ultimately, the most trustworthy alphas exhibit coherence across metrics: moderate Sharpe, stable turnover, smooth drawdowns, and consistent contribution across time and regimes.

I’ve run into the same issue, and over time I’ve come to treat Sharpe as a  *necessary but very incomplete*  filter. The metrics I trust most tend to answer different failure modes:

- **Robust / Ladder Sharpe**  is usually my next stop. If performance collapses when you remove regimes, shift windows, or ladder through time, the alpha is likely overfit to a narrow period even if headline Sharpe looks great.
- **Drawdown structure** , not just max drawdown. I look at how drawdowns form: slow, recoverable drawdowns are much healthier than sharp cliff-like losses driven by a few days. Persistent underwater periods are often more concerning than a single deep drawdown.
- **Turnover stability**  across settings. An alpha whose turnover explodes when you tweak decay or neutralization is fragile. I prefer signals where turnover and performance move smoothly together.
- **PnL concentration / tail dependence** . Removing the top few days or wins by bucket often reveals whether the alpha is structural or living off rare events.
- **Exposure consistency**  (sector, beta, side). If returns come mostly from one side or one sector, it’s usually a disguised factor bet rather than a durable alpha.

In practice, I’m looking for  *agreement*  across metrics. A strong alpha doesn’t have to be perfect everywhere, but when Sharpe, robustness, drawdown behavior, and turnover all tell a consistent story, that’s when I start to trust it.
