Focus on achieving naturally low turnover by keeping your decay at 0. It’s usually better to have a turnover of 20 with zero decay than a turnover of 15 with a decay value greater than 5.Instead of reducing turnover through decay adjustments, use turnover-control operators such as hump operators, TS target operators, TS decay exponential windows, and decay linear operators.

Always ensure your IS performance is consistent. Check whether the most recent years in the IS table summary are close to your overall IS statistics. Large increases or decreases in the later years are often signs of overfitting.

Also test alpha robustness using a proper train/test/IS split. Compare the PnL performance across training, testing, and IS periods. Significant drops between these periods usually indicate overfitting.

An alpha that performs consistently across all these tests while maintaining strong natural fitness and Sharpe is generally more reliable in the long run.

Strong insight. Natural low turnover is usually more robust than artificially reducing turnover with high decay. Using operators like hump, TS target, and decay windows preserves signal quality better.

The focus on IS consistency is also important. Large performance shifts in recent years often signal overfitting. Comparing train, test, and IS results is one of the best ways to judge whether an alpha is truly robust long term.

Very valuable insight, especially the point about prioritizing naturally low turnover instead of forcing it through high decay values. Many people optimize for metrics without checking whether the alpha still behaves consistently across different periods. The emphasis on robustness testing and stable IS performance is what really separates durable alphas from overfitted ones.

Agreed. Natural low turnover is usually a stronger sign of a robust signal than artificially suppressing turnover with high decay. Consistency across train/test/IS periods matters a lot more than chasing inflated Sharpe from overfit setups.
