I’ve been exploring different cross-sectional operators lately, but I’m still figuring out the best practices for applying them in simulations.

Can anyone share some tips or strategies for building stronger signals using cross-sectional operators?
 How do you decide when to combine them with other operator types for better performance?

Here are some tips that have worked for me:

- Keep experimenting with new cross-sectional operators—you’ll be surprised how underutilized ones like  `arc_tan`  or  `log_diff`  can significantly improve performance.
- **On combining operators:**  I believe it’s fine to combine them as long as the core alpha makes sense and they’re not performing similar functions. For ex, using  `scale(zscore(core_alpha))`  won’t add much value to performance, and  `rank(scale(core_alpha))`  won’t differ from  `rank(core_alpha)` . However, you can try something like  `zscore(arc_tan(core_alpha))` . You might wonder what the z-score of an arctan even represents, but I don’t think that matters much—it’s simply a way to transform an economically grounded idea (core_alpha) that could potentially work.

Use cross-sectional operators to express relative mispricing, not absolute levels. Prefer rank for robustness, neutralize sectors or countries, and smooth ranks to reduce turnover. Match operators to signal distributions, avoid excessive stacking, ensure large universes, and combine CS signals with time-series confirmation to improve persistence and after-cost Sharpe.

Ranking or z-scoring before neutralization often improves robustness. It reduces outliers and prevents a few names from dominating the signal.
