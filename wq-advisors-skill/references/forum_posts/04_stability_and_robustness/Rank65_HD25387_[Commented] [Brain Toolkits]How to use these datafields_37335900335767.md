Hey there, Community Members!

In our  **Brain Toolkits**  series, all consultants are invited to share in the comments section whatever you’ve got from your research journey—be it the tricky problems you ran into, the handy tips and takeaways you’ve summed up, or your insights into operators and data fields. Let’s turn this post into a go-to resource hub that helps everyone boost work efficiency! I’ll be updating this post on a regular basis, so your active participation is more than welcome.

And here’s the theme for this edition:  **How to Work with Non-conventional Data?**  We’d love to hear your thoughts on the following types of data:

- Option-related vector data (without put/call information)
- News event data (date period-based data)
- Social media data (excluding score, ranking, and similar metrics)

Non-conventional data works best when treated structurally, not literally. Option vectors can proxy positioning and convexity via dispersion and skew dynamics. News period data benefits from decay and clustering logic instead of timestamps. Raw social activity reveals crowd attention through persistence and surprise. Focus on transformations, temporal context, and interaction with price regimes rather than direct prediction.

I've had some success with option-related vector data by focusing on implied volatility term structure patterns rather than directional bets. Computing cross-sectional rankings of IV skew changes ( `rank(ts_delta(iv_skew, 5))` ) helped identify sentiment shifts. For news event data, I found that measuring event clustering density ( `ts_sum(event_indicator, N)` ) works better than individual event flags - sustained news flow often matters more than single events. The key challenge is avoiding look-ahead bias with date ranges. I haven't explored social media data deeply yet, but I imagine similar temporal aggregation logic would apply. What's been your experience with the lag structure of these alternative datasets?

For non-conventional data, I rarely rely on raw levels and instead focus on  *relative changes and structure* . For option vectors without put/call, dispersion, skew, or time-series changes (e.g. ts_std, ts_rank) often capture positioning better than absolute values. For period-based news data, treating it as an event shock—comparing pre/post windows or applying longer decay—helps reduce short-term noise. Social media works best as a crowd-attention proxy: changes in intensity, frequency, or persistence are usually more robust than raw counts, especially when combined with smoothing and ranking.

I’ve found non-conventional data works best when abstracted into  *structure*  rather than used directly. For option vectors without put/call, relative changes (dispersion, skew dynamics, ts_rank/ts_std) tend to proxy positioning better than levels. For period-based news, aggregating intensity or clustering with decay is usually more robust than single events. Social data feels most useful as a crowd-attention signal—changes in persistence or surprise, smoothed and ranked, outperform raw activity counts.
