How does using  `subtract(x, y, filter = false)`  differ from simply applying  `abs(x - y)`  in alpha design, and why might preserving NaN values be important for signal continuity?

Good point to raise. The key difference is that  `subtract(x, y, filter = false)`  explicitly handles missing values (NaN). Unlike  `abs(x - y)` , which may silently drop or transform NaNs during calculations,  `subtract()`  allows you to preserve them. Preserving NaNs is important because it keeps the signal aligned with the data timeline and prevents artificial continuity. This way, you avoid introducing false signals where data is incomplete.

I guess  **subtract(x, y, filter = false)** is more important in that case,  **filter = false** is used for filtering outliers in your alpha expression. In that way, it helps stabilize your alpha. Otherwise, I don't fully have experience with the same operator, but I have used it sometimes, and the experience is that it sometimes helps strengthen your alpha, rather than  **abs(x-y)** , which is occasionally helpful to enhancing the absolute values of your data field.

The key difference between  `subtract(x, y, filter = false)`  and  `abs(x - y)`  lies in directional information. With  `subtract()` , we retain whether x is greater or less than y, which is crucial for building long-short signals where the sign of the deviation determines position direction. By contrast,  `abs(x - y)`  removes that directional bias and is more suited to measuring magnitude for volatility or dispersion analysis. Another subtle but important point is the handling of NaN values— `filter = false`  ensures alignment across time series, preventing silent drops that could desynchronize related expressions. This continuity is especially important when chaining multiple operators, like  `zscore(subtract(close, mean(close, 20)))` , where even small gaps could distort the scaling. One practical application I’ve found useful is comparing short- versus long-term moving averages:  `subtract(mean(close, 5), mean(close, 20))`  captures momentum shifts directly, whereas  `abs()`  would fail to reflect directional crossover. Have you experimented with layering  `subtract()`  after  `group_neutralize()`  to see whether relative deviations within groups offer stronger signals?

Hi there. Nice point! I think one subtle but important distinction is that  `subtract(x, y, filter=false)`  maintains directionality and also handles NaN propagation, while  `abs(x-y)`  discards the sign completely. That matters a lot when you want to track not just the distance but the actual side of deviation (positive vs. negative). Preserving NaNs also avoids introducing fake continuity, which can otherwise bias rolling stats or decay functions. Curious if you’ve noticed differences in stability when chaining subtract into downstream operators?

You’re right— `subtract(x, y, filter=false)`  can be more impactful in certain cases. Setting  `filter=false`  allows you to include outliers in the calculation, which can help stabilize your alpha by preserving the full signal structure. From my experience, using  `subtract`  this way sometimes strengthens the alpha more effectively than  `abs(x-y)` , which mainly amplifies absolute differences but doesn’t always improve the predictive power of the signal.

Exactly— `subtract(x, y, filter=false)`  differs from  `abs(x - y)`  because it explicitly preserves NaNs instead of dropping or transforming them. Keeping NaNs intact is important for maintaining alignment with the data timeline, ensuring your alpha doesn’t create artificial continuity or false signals when information is missing. This makes the resulting signal more reliable and robust.
