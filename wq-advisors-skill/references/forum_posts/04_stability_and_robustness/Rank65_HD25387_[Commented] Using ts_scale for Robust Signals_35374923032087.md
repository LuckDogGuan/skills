## 帖子正文

The  `ts_scale(x, d)`  operator rescales signals to a fixed range (e.g., -1 to 1) over a rolling window. This reduces distortions from large outliers and makes signals more comparable across time.
Example: Scaling momentum ratios before ranking helps prevent a single spike from dominating weights. ts_scale is especially useful in datasets with high volatility.
👉 Question: Do you use ts_scale mainly for preprocessing or as a final step before ranking?

I tend to use ts_scale mostly as a preprocessing step. It helps stabilize inputs and prevent extreme values from dominating before applying further transforms like ranking. Using it as the very last step is less common for me, unless I specifically need bounded comparability across time.

This is a very good insight. I will also try this and see the results. I.e, using it as a preprocessing step before ranking. From this statement it is possible to say it works almost the same way as rank, only that rank ranks 0 to 1.

This is a really useful insight, and I plan to try it as well by applying it as a preprocessing step before ranking. From this perspective, it behaves much like a rank transformation, with the main difference being that rank maps values into a 0–1 range, while this approach preserves a bit more of the original scale.

For me,  `ts_scale`  works best before ranking or neutralization. It standardizes the time-series behavior first, then lets rank focus on cross-sectional separation more cleanly.

The  `ts_scale(x, d)`  operator rescales a signal into a fixed bounded range, typically between −1 and 1, over a rolling window. This helps reduce distortions caused by large outliers and improves comparability of the signal across time. It is particularly useful for datasets with high volatility, where occasional spikes can otherwise dominate downstream transformations or portfolio weights. For example, scaling momentum or ratio-based signals before ranking can prevent a single extreme observation from overwhelming the cross-sectional structure.

I mostly treat  `ts_scale`  as a preprocessing step rather than a final transformation. In this role, it behaves somewhat like a rank transform, but with an important distinction: ranking compresses information into relative order, while  `ts_scale`  preserves more of the original magnitude within a controlled range. This often results in a smoother, more stable input before applying ranking or z-scoring. Using  `ts_scale`  as a final step is less common, unless bounded time-series comparability is explicitly required. In what situations do you prefer  `ts_scale`  over rank or z-score as the primary normalization step in alpha construction?

This is a very helpful insight, and I plan to try it as a preprocessing step before ranking as well. Viewed this way, it behaves similarly to a rank transformation the key difference is that rank compresses values into a 0–1 range, while this method retains more information from the original scale, which can help preserve signal strength and relative magnitude.

I usually treat  **ts_scale**  as an early-stage preprocessing tool. It’s useful for stabilizing inputs and keeping outliers from overwhelming the signal before applying subsequent transformations like ranking. I rarely use it as the final step, except in cases where I need values to remain comparable and bounded across time.
