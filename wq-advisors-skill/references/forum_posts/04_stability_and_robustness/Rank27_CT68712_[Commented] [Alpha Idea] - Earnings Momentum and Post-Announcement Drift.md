#### **Signal Concept**

**Core Hypothesis** : Earnings surprises often lead to delayed price adjustments as investors process new information. Stocks with strong earnings momentum post-announcement are likely to exhibit continued positive or negative drift in returns, depending on the nature of the surprise.

#### **Alpha Signal Framework** :

1. **Earnings Surprise Analysis** :
   - Use data fields like  **EPS surprise** ,  **earnings growth** , and  **revenue growth**  to measure deviations from analyst expectations.
2. **Momentum Factor** :
   - Incorporate momentum operators such as  `ts_delta`  or  `ts_rank`  to quantify the direction and strength of price movements following earnings announcements.
3. **Cross-Sectional Comparison** :
   - Use operators like  `group_zscore`  or  `group_rank`  to normalize earnings momentum signals within sectors or industries.
4. **Post-Announcement Drift** :
   - Include rolling correlations between  **earnings surprise**  and  **subsequent returns**  over a defined lookback period to capture delayed market reactions.

#### **Example Alpha Expression** :

#### `alpha = group_zscore(ts_rank(earnings_surprise * ts_delta(close, 5), 20), industry) * ts_corr(revenue_growth, returns, 10)`

This Alpha leverages the persistent impact of earnings surprises and aligns with the phenomenon of post-announcement drift, focusing on cross-sectional and momentum-based insights for robust signal generation.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

This Alpha idea is well-structured, effectively combining  **Earnings Momentum**  and  **Post-Announcement Drift**  to capture delayed market reactions. Using  **EPS surprise, revenue growth, and momentum operators**  like  `ts_rank`  and  `group_zscore`  adds depth to the signal.

One question:

1. Could outliers distort the signal, and would  `winsorize`  or  `ts_median`  help?

Also, have you tested different lookback periods (e.g., 10, 20, 60 days) or considered adding  **Earnings Quality**  or  **Institutional Flows**  for robustness? Lastly, does  `group_zscore`  work equally well across industries?

This  **Earnings Surprise-based Alpha Signal**  framework you've proposed is a strong concept, as it effectively combines both the  **immediate market reaction**  to earnings announcements (through earnings surprise) and the  **longer-term momentum**  that follows as the market digests the news. The idea of capturing post-announcement drift, where stock prices continue to move in the direction of the earnings surprise, is well-founded based on observed market behavior. Let's break it down and highlight how each component contributes to creating a robust alpha signal:

After you have your signals for earnings surprise, momentum, and cross-sectional comparison, you can combine them into a composite alpha score:

1. **Alpha Score**  = Weight1 * (EPS Surprise) + Weight2 * (Momentum Factor) + Weight3 * (Sector Rank or Z-score)
   - Assign weights to each component based on their perceived importance. For example, if you believe earnings surprise is the strongest predictor, you can assign a higher weight to that.

Ensure that you are using the correct spelling and format for the data field  `mdl138_3idpc` . Sometimes, an extra space or incorrect character can cause simulation errors. Double-check both the data field name in your simulation configuration and the actual data section.

To analyze post-announcement drift, we look at the behavior of stock prices following earnings announcements. The core idea is that stocks with strong earnings momentum (either positive or negative) are likely to continue drifting in the same direction, as investors slowly digest and react to the new information. To quantify this, the following factors can be considered:

Strong framework combining fundamental and technical factors. Consider adding volume-weighted price momentum to better capture institutional trading patterns post-earnings. Also, incorporating earnings call sentiment analysis could enhance signal quality. Suggest testing different time windows (3-day, 5-day, 10-day) for optimal post-announcement drift capture.

Hey, this earning momentum alpha idea is super interesting! As someone who has dabbled in quantitative trading, I appreciate the blend of earnings surprises and post-announcement drift. It makes perfect sense that investors take time to process new data, leading to delayed reactions in stock prices. Your use of operators like ts_rank and group_zscore shows a solid understanding of momentum. I'm curious about your thoughts on potential outliers—would using winsorize improve signal integrity? Also, have you considered the influence of sectoral differences? Would love to chat more about how this might play out in real-world scenarios! Cheers!

### 评论 #12 (作者: AC63290, 时间: 1年前)

Continuously rebalance your portfolio to optimize your asset allocation. Consider the correlation between your assets and make adjustments based on the market conditions and your risk tolerance. Balancing between growth and defensive assets can help improve returns while managing risk.

**EPS Surprise** : This measures how actual earnings per share (EPS) compare to analysts’ expectations. A positive surprise means the company earned more than expected, which typically triggers a bullish reaction in the stock price.

This is a well-structured alpha signal concept that effectively captures the delayed price reaction to earnings surprises. The combination of  **earnings surprise analysis** ,  **momentum factors** ,  **cross-sectional comparison** , and  **post-announcement drift**  aligns well with known market inefficiencies.

A few thoughts and potential refinements:

1. **Lookback Period Sensitivity**  – Have you tested different lookback periods for  `ts_corr(revenue_growth, returns, 10)` ? A shorter window (e.g., 5 days) might capture immediate reactions, while a longer one (e.g., 20-30 days) could better exploit post-announcement drift.
2. **Volatility Adjustment**  – Since earnings surprises can trigger high volatility, incorporating a volatility normalization factor (e.g., dividing by  `ts_stddev(returns, 20)` ) might improve signal stability.
3. **Sector-Specific Effects**  – While  `group_zscore(..., industry)`  helps normalize within industries, some sectors (e.g., tech vs. utilities) may react differently to surprises. A dynamic weighting mechanism based on past sector volatility could enhance robustness.
4. **Confirmation from Institutional Flows**  – If available, adding institutional buy/sell pressure post-earnings could strengthen the signal, ensuring that price moves are driven by informed participants rather than retail noise.

Have you done any backtesting on this expression? Curious to hear how it performs across different market conditions!

**`alpha = trade_when(event, signal, abs(close - close_at_event) / close > .1);`** 
This line is setting up the condition for when the trade should happen. The expression  `abs(close - close_at_event) / close > .1`  is checking whether the price has moved by more than 10% from the entry price (stored in  `close_at_event` ), based on the current close price. When this condition is met,  `alpha`  will be set to  `True` , signaling that the condition for the trade has been satisfied.

The core concept behind the  **Earnings Surprise**  alpha signal is based on the observation that earnings surprises—whether positive or negative—often lead to a delayed price adjustment. Investors take time to digest new earnings information, and stocks with strong earnings momentum tend to continue drifting in the same direction post-announcement.

### 评论 #22 (作者: PG40959, 时间: 1年前)

Have you explored how different earnings measures interact with price momentum? For example,  *earnings growth persistence*  (looking at EPS trends over multiple quarters) might strengthen the alpha by filtering out one-time surprises that don’t lead to sustained drift. A rolling function like  *ts_mean(EPS surprise, 4)*  could help smooth out quarterly noise and provide a better measure of earnings momentum.
