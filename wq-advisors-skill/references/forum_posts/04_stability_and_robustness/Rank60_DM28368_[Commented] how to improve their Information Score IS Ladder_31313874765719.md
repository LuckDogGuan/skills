**✅ Ways to enhance Alpha and ascend the IS Ladder:** 
 **1. Denoise the Signal** 
Smooth noisy raw input using moving averages, rank transforms, or z-scores.

Shun using extremely short-term or highly reactive data – this tends not to generalize.

**2. Prevent Overfitting** 
Backtests that perform wonderfully in one area but crash in another typically signal overfitting.

Implement cross-sectional logic rather than absolute thresholds.

Example: rank(open - close) * rank(volume) tends to be stronger than if close > open then

3. Normalize by Universe Use relative ranks within the universe (e.g., industry or region ranking).

This puts your alpha in better proportion relative to different regions' baseline activities.

**4. Diversify Inputs**

Integrate various kinds of signals

Price-based (momentum, mean re

Basic (if permitted) Don't depend upon one idea alone — blend decorrelated alpha drivers.

This article provides a clear and practical guide to improving the Information Score (IS) in alpha models—an aspect often overlooked by many developers when optimizing performance. I particularly appreciate the advice on denoising signals using techniques like moving averages and rank transforms, which is a crucial step toward enhancing generalization. The section on preventing overfitting is also very helpful, especially the recommendation to prioritize cross-sectional logic over absolute thresholds, making alphas more robust across datasets. Normalizing by universe and diversifying signal inputs demonstrate the author’s deep understanding of how alphas function in real-world scenarios. One suggestion would be to include more concrete examples for each section to help readers apply the concepts more easily. Thank you to the author for such a valuable and actionable post!

Thank you for this post—it really helped clarify the practical steps to improve IS Ladder performance. As someone still refining my alpha development process, the advice on using cross-sectional logic and avoiding overfitting was especially helpful. I also appreciate the emphasis on signal diversification—it’s easy to over-rely on a single concept when trying to boost Sharpe, but your post reminds me that long-term stability often comes from combining multiple, weakly correlated ideas. Would love to see a follow-up with specific alpha snippets or feature engineering examples that implement these principles

improve, select alpha index from the beginning: low turnover, higher IS, higher sharpe last 2 years, alpha can replace neutralization but the parameter is still stable, submitting alpha with diverse data sets will help you improve combined alpha performance

Focus on denoising signals, avoiding overfitting, normalizing across universes, and diversifying inputs to build stronger, more adaptable alphas.

One key tactic I’ve found useful for improving the IS Ladder is actively analyzing how your alpha performs across  **impact buckets**  during backtesting—not just after submission. A common mistake is optimizing purely for raw Sharpe or overall CAP, while ignoring how the alpha degrades at higher impact levels. I now routinely implement  **rank-based smoothing**  and include  **turnover penalties**  during alpha generation to reduce noise and stabilize IS across all buckets. Additionally,  **signal orthogonality**  matters—combining decorrelated inputs (e.g., one based on volume momentum and another on price reversal) often improves the entire IS Ladder structure. Lastly, running  **bucket-specific diagnostics**  helps flag weak spots before submitting to the platform. Scalability isn’t just a result—it should be a design goal.

Thanks for this practical guide on improving IS Ladder performance! The emphasis on denoising signals, using cross-sectional logic, and normalizing by universe provides a solid foundation for building more robust and generalizable alphas. Combining decorrelated inputs instead of relying on one signal is a key takeaway I’ll definitely apply. Including some alpha code snippets or real use-case transformations in a follow-up would make this even more actionable. Looking forward to more insights like this—really helpful!
