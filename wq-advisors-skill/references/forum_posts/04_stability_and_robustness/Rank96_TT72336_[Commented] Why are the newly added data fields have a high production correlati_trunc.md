## 帖子正文

I have already tried the new datasets, but I have found they have a bit of high production correlation, even though I was expecting them to portray low values of the same.

Anyways, changing the idea of submitable alphas for a particular data field has shown to reduce the correlation.

Anyone can share ideas on how to go about this and comment on the best fashion of idea creation, and whether combining datasets may give better performance with low correlations.

Prod correlation is calculated using daily PnL values over the last 4 years, so if multiple fields are derived from the same underlying raw data, they may end up showing production correlation.

Interesting observations! High production correlation can indeed limit the alpha’s uniqueness, even with new datasets. Changing the alpha formulation for the same data field is a smart approach—it helps extract diverse signals and reduce redundancy. In my experience, combining complementary datasets (e.g., fundamentals + alternative data) often enhances performance and lowers correlation. It’s also useful to explore different transformations, lags, or cross-sectional vs. time-series logic.

Thank you for the clarification,  [AK40989](/hc/en-us/profiles/26422151767703-AK40989) . I appreciate your explanation.

That’s an insightful point. High production correlation in new data fields often arises because the fields may be structurally related to existing datasets, even if user and alpha counts are zero. One way to mitigate this is by applying transformations (e.g., normalization, non-linear operators) or combining datasets in a complementary way to reduce overlap. Exploring orthogonal or less-used features can also help generate lower correlation while keeping performance strong.

Exploring dataset combinations is a smart approach—sometimes blending diverse sources reduces correlation and improves alpha uniqueness. Also, experimenting with feature transformations or non-linear interactions can help. Curious to hear how others structure idea generation for low correlation alphas.

Combining datasets runs the risk of overfitting. However, what I often find is, it might help "purify" your primary signal if you neutralize the primary data field against other fields (pv, risk, for instance).

HI  [AS77213](/hc/en-us/profiles/10752416693655-AS77213) ,

Thanks for sharing these insightful observations! I completely agree that high production correlation can limit an alpha’s uniqueness, even when using new datasets.

Prod correlation uses daily PnL over the past 4 years, so fields derived from the same raw data can show correlation.

Since prod correlation is calculated from daily PnL over the last 4 years, fields made from the same raw data can still show correlation in production. Even if two fields look different while testing, they may end up overlapping if they come from the same base source. This is a good reminder to check how fields are built and try to keep them diverse. Avoiding duplication makes alphas stronger, more reliable, and better suited for real competition performance.

Production correlation is calculated using daily PnL over the past 4 years. So, if multiple fields come from the same raw data, their production correlation may be high because they behave similarly in real trading—even if their formulas differ. This happens since shared data causes overlapping performance patterns, making the signals less diverse than they appear.

You have some very important information I did not know about. Thank you all for sharing such wonderful ideas and information.

**Production correlation**  is measured using daily  **PnL**  over four years, so fields from the same raw data can overlap. Your idea of reformulating alphas is excellent, as it diversifies signals. Combining complementary datasets, applying varied transformations, and testing cross-sectional or time-series logic often reduces correlation and enhances overall alpha uniqueness.

Absolutely, that’s a key observation. High production correlation in new data fields often occurs because the fields are inherently linked to existing datasets, even when user and alpha counts are zero. To mitigate this, you can apply transformations like normalization or non-linear operators, or combine datasets strategically to reduce redundancy. Targeting orthogonal or underutilized features can also help lower correlation while maintaining strong predictive performance.

### 评论 #15 (作者: AG14039, 时间: 9个月前)

Absolutely! Combining datasets thoughtfully can reduce correlation and boost the distinctiveness of alphas. Layering feature transformations, non-linear interactions, or cross-sectional relationships often uncovers hidden signals that single datasets miss. It’s also useful to evaluate incremental contribution to predictive power after controlling for baseline factors to ensure each addition adds unique value. I’d be interested to see how others prioritize or structure their idea generation to consistently produce low-correlation alphas.

Insightful points! High production correlation can definitely dilute an alpha’s distinctiveness, even when new datasets are introduced. Tweaking the formulation for the same data field is a clever tactic—it helps uncover diverse signals and mitigate redundancy. In my experience, blending complementary datasets—like fundamentals with alternative data—often boosts performance while reducing correlation. It’s also worth experimenting with different transformations, lag structures, and toggling between cross-sectional and time-series frameworks to unlock more robust signals.
