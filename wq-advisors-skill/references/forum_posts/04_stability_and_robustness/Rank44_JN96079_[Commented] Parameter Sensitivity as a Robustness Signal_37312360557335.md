In my experience, alphas that require extremely tight parameter tuning to work in one universe rarely survive elsewhere. Mild parameter flexibility across markets seems like a strong indicator of structural effects. How much parameter drift do you personally tolerate?

Parameter flexibility is a strong robustness signal. I tolerate roughly 20-30% drift in lookback windows and decay settings while maintaining acceptable performance - beyond that, the alpha likely captures noise rather than structural effects. The key test is whether the optimal parameters cluster around similar ranges across regions or scatter randomly. Alphas requiring drastically different parameters per universe are usually overfit. Do you systematically test parameter sensitivity ranges during development, or mostly discover drift issues during cross-universe validation?

I also treat  **parameter sensitivity**  as a key robustness signal. Personally, I’m comfortable with moderate parameter drift (e.g., ±20–30% changes in lookback or small decay shifts) as long as the  **signal direction and economic logic remain intact** , even if Sharpe declines. Alphas that only work at a very narrow “sweet spot” usually feel more noise-fitted than structurally driven. For me, acceptable drift means graceful degradation rather than sudden collapse—robust signals should bend, not break, when parameters move.

I’m very much aligned with that view. As a rough rule of thumb, I’m comfortable with  **small, smooth degradation**  rather than sharp breakage: if changing a lookback, decay, or constant by ~20–30% only trims performance but preserves direction and basic shape, that’s usually acceptable. What worries me is when an alpha flips sign, collapses, or only works at a single “magic” setting. I also look for consistency across adjacent universes or regions rather than identical metrics—structure should travel even if efficiency changes. So I tolerate parameter drift as long as the alpha’s  *behavior*  stays intact; once the logic stops generalizing, that’s usually where I draw the line.
