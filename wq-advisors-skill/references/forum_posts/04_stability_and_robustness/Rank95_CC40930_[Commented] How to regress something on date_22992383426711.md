For example I defined a signal and want to output its slope according to date. What should be the input X here in function ts_regression(signal,X,rettype=2)? I would appreciate your answers.

Hi! Try using x = ts_step(1) Operator as a parameter in ts_regression, then x will be time variable.

ts_regression(signal, ts_step(1), 252, rettype=2)

Your approach to defining the signal and applying regression to measure its slope over time is interesting. Using the time index as the independent variable ( `X` ) seems like a reasonable approach, especially if you're looking to capture the trend of your signal over time. It’s also great that you’re considering different  `rettype`  options to extract meaningful insights from the regression. I’d suggest testing this on various signals and analyzing how sensitive the slope is to different time periods to ensure robustness in the model. Keep iterating to refine the strategy further, and good luck with your alpha development!

Hi, I hope Brain will have a post explaining how the multi regression operator works, I tried it and noticed the last variable can be both data and number, so I'm quite curious

In the time series regression, the independent variable is represented by the X argument in the function ts_regression(signal, X, rettype=2). The input X should be the time or date index that corresponds to the signal as you wish to determine the signal's slope over time. Here's how to indicate and organise X:

Signal: The values you wish to examine are represented by this dependent variable.
A numerical representation of time should be represented by X (Time/Date); examples include sequential integers, timestamps that have been transformed to ordinal numbers, or any other reasonable conversion of dates into numeric values.

The return type is usually the regression's slope if rettype=2 is present in the function. To effectively read the slope, make sure your X values are scaled (e.g., consecutive numbers or standardised).
Think about converting your dates to ordinal numbers or a format that preserves the time gaps if they are not evenly spaced.

**`X`** : This should represent the independent variable, which in your case is time. You need to provide the dates or timestamps corresponding to each value of the  `signal` . These can be either numerical values (e.g., days since a specific starting date) or actual date objects, depending on the function's requirements.

"Great insights! The use of group operators definitely adds value to signal clarity and performance evaluation. I totally agree that optimizing and neutralizing within groups is key to reducing risks. Looking forward to experimenting with some of these strategies myself!"

"Excellent points! Leveraging group operators undoubtedly enhances signal clarity and improves performance assessment. I completely agree that focusing on optimization and neutralization within groups is crucial for mitigating risks. Excited to try out some of these strategies on my own!"

It can be any dataset that regresses to increase the performance of the signal value. I usually use ts_rank(x,d) a basic operator.

The answer correctly identifies X as the independent variable representing time for the ts_regression function. To elaborate: X needs to be a sequence of values corresponding to the timestamps of your signal. Consider these options for X, depending on your platform and data:

**1. Numerical Time** : Simplest approach - assign consecutive integers (1, 2, 3...) to each date, or calculate days since a specific starting date. This is often the most compatible format.

**2. Date Objects/Timestamps:**  You might consider using the ts_ operators

Ensure the length of X matches the length of your signal and that X is ordered chronologically. Without more context about the specific ts_regression implementation, it's hard to give more precise guidance.

Thank you for your excellent sharing.
I've also read more of the operator guides on the Platform, but the explanations and examples for the multivariate regression operator are still not plentiful or detailed enough.
Hoping to receive more explanations from other experienced consultants.
