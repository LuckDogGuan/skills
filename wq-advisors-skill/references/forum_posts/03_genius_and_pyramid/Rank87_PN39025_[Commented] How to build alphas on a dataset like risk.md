## 帖子正文

I've realized that my alpha generation efforts are currently concentrated solely on analyst dataset and model dataset. To diversify my strategy, I'm interested in exploring risk-related datasets for additional alpha opportunities. Could you advise me on: 1) How to build reliable risk data  (e.g., volatility indicators, credit spreads, geopolitical risk indices)? 2) Are there any proven frameworks or templates for extracting signals from risk data? 3) What preprocessing techniques are particularly important for risk datasets (normalization, outlier handling, etc.)? I'd greatly appreciate any practical suggestions, recommended research papers, or links to educational materials on this topic. Thank you for your guidance!

You will also find quantitative fields similar to analyst and model data categories in the risk segment. For the other datasets of risk, I have found them to be best used in controlling certain kinds of risk. For example, neutralizing with P/E avoids strong bets on high P/E stocks. Consider using risk data fields in place of P/E.

My opinion .first of all.  1)-You should understand the Risk datasets in Volatility,Drawdown matrix,VaR etc. 2)-Preprosses the risk data. 3)Builds alpha using operators. 4)Combine risk and price. 5)Evaluate in genius/simulation. 6)Reduce self-correlation.thats the keys points to build alphas..

Accumulate experience to diversify your ideas more than you, I see there are many documents that are guided by wq about finance. If you improve those ideas, you will create very strong alpha in terms of quality.

As far as i know  **Preprocessing is key**  for risk datasets. Always handle outliers (winsorize or clip at the tails), normalize using z-scores or ranks (especially for cross-sectional use), and consider log transforms for skewed metrics like credit spreads or vol indices. Smoothing techniques like moving averages or exponential decay are also helpful to reduce noise.

You just need to simulate different risk datasets with different operators and days and combine it with analyst /model/ price or any other datafield through which you get the best alphas. Just try to keep turnover <30, sharpe as high as poosible, drawdown and return ratio should pe >1 etc.

Try to make you alpha as diverse as possible.

It’s a smart move to explore risk-related data for more alpha ideas. You can start by using data like volatility indexes (such as VIX), credit spreads (CDS or bond yield spreads), and geopolitical risk scores (like the GPR index). For finding signals, try models that look at market regimes or risk factor exposures. When working with risk data, make sure to clean it well normalize values, handle missing or extreme points, and check for sudden changes. You can check research from AQR or RiskLab for more ideas. Let me know if you’d like links or simple guides.

Risk-related datasets like volatility indices (VIX), credit spreads, and geopolitical risk scores can be integrated as macro risk indicators to enhance signal robustness. Construct features such as rolling volatility, CDS spread changes, or normalized geopolitical shocks to serve as risk premia proxies. Apply preprocessing techniques like winsorization, Z-score normalization, and rolling-window smoothing to handle non-stationarity and outliers. Proven frameworks involve combining these risk features with existing analyst/model signals via orthogonalization or regime filtering to generate alphas resilient to market stress.

Cross-sectional ranks of credit-sensitive metrics can reduce self-correlation and improve alpha uniqueness. Focus on transformations like  `log_diff` ,  `ts_stddev` , or  `ts_skewness`  over longer windows to capture persistent risk signals. Apply  `zscore` ,  `truncate` , or  `scale`  to normalize and dampen outliers before ranking. Risk signals tend to perform well in regime shifts, so designing them to react asymmetrically during drawdowns adds value. Always check correlation against production and self-alphas to maintain orthogonality.

Start with defining the risk type:  **volatility** ,  **credit risk** , or  **systemic/geopolitical risk** . For volatility, use indicators like  `ts_std(close, N)` ,  `ts_volatility` , or realized beta. Credit risk proxies (if CDS spreads aren't available) can be approximated using leverage ratios, interest coverage, or macro indicators like TED spreads. Geopolitical risk can be extracted from news sentiment indices or event-based dummy variables.

By thoughtfully integrating risk data and preprocessing techniques, you can build robust, orthogonal alphas that respond to different market regimes and avoid overfitting to crowded signals.

I'd recommend you;

1. *Identify relevant risk factors*: Determine which risk metrics (e.g., beta, volatility, Value-at-Risk) are most relevant to your alpha strategy.

2. *Develop a risk model*: Create a model that incorporates these risk factors to predict future returns or risk-adjusted performance.

3. *Define alpha signals*: Use the risk model outputs to generate alpha signals, such as ranking stocks by risk-adjusted returns or identifying under/overvalued assets.

4. *Backtest and refine*: Test your alpha strategy on historical data and refine it based on performance metrics.

Incorporating cross-sectional ranks of credit-sensitive metrics helps reduce self-correlation and enhances alpha uniqueness by focusing on transformations like log differences, time-series standard deviation, or skewness over longer windows to capture persistent risk signals. Normalizing data using z-score, truncation, or scaling dampens outliers before ranking, improving signal quality. Risk signals that react asymmetrically during drawdowns add value, especially during regime shifts. Integrating risk-related datasets such as volatility indices (VIX), credit spreads, and geopolitical risk scores as macro risk indicators further strengthens signal robustness. Features like rolling volatility, CDS spread changes, or normalized geopolitical shocks act as proxies for risk premia. Applying preprocessing techniques like winsorization, normalization, and smoothing addresses non-stationarity and outliers. Combining these risk features with analyst or model signals through orthogonalization or regime filtering creates alphas that are resilient in market stress. Research from AQR and RiskLab offers valuable insights for developing such strategies.

Explore multiple risk datasets with different operators and lookback windows, then combine them with analyst/model/price (and other) fields to surface your strongest alphas. Keep execution targets disciplined: aim for turnover under 30%, maximize Sharpe, and maintain a return-to-drawdown ratio above 1 (or better).

Exploring risk-related datasets can help diversify your strategy beyond analyst and model data, as they capture dimensions of uncertainty often missed by fundamentals. Reliable proxies can be built through realized or idiosyncratic volatility, rolling betas, or equity-implied credit risk, while broader measures such as economic policy uncertainty or geopolitical risk indices can be mapped to firm or regional exposures. The real challenge is integrating these measures into alpha design in a way that complements existing signals without overwhelming them. A useful approach is to treat risk indicators as filters or modifiers, for example allowing volatility conditions to adjust the weight of momentum or sentiment-based factors. Because risk data is often noisy, preprocessing becomes essential: handling outliers through winsorization or transformations, applying normalization across time and sectors, and using smoothing to reduce random spikes. Combining fast-moving and slower-moving risk signals often yields a more balanced and robust alpha profile, but it is critical to validate across both IS and OS to ensure stability. Done properly, risk datasets can add a new layer of depth and resilience to your alpha generation.
