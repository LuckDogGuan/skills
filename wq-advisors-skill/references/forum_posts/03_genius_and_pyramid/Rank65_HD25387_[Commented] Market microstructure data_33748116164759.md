Could anyone please explain how to use this market microstructure data to craft high quality signals with a lower turnover!!

Great question! To reduce turnover using market microstructure data, try focusing on  **liquidity-driven features**  like bid-ask spread, order book imbalance, or volume-weighted price. These can signal more stable trading opportunities. Also, consider  **aggregating over longer intervals**  (e.g., daily averages) instead of reacting to tick-level noise — this helps lower turnover naturally.

Can you please give me some tips about your journey into master, I am being consistent and submitting 4 diverse alphas per day, I can see a lot of people are struck in gold even with their efforts

Totally agree with leveraging liquidity features. In my experience, combining order book dynamics (like imbalance or depth skew) with short-term volatility measures can help identify persistent signals while reducing noise. Also, applying decay functions or smoothing to intraday signals can further control turnover. Would love to hear how others structure these signals in production.

Great question! Market microstructure data—like bid-ask spread, order book imbalance, or volume-at-price—can be a goldmine for capturing intraday dynamics. To reduce turnover while maintaining signal quality, I’ve found it helpful to smooth these signals using  `ts_decay`  or  `ts_av_diff`  over longer horizons, then normalize with  `zscore` . For example, persistent spread widening might hint at future volatility, while order flow imbalance can signal latent pressure. Combining these with low-frequency price or volume signals can create robust, lower-turnover alphas. Would love to hear how others are integrating microstructure features!

Thanks for the great inputs! I’ve been exploring volume concentration and VWAP deviation over longer horizons as ways to extract directional cues without triggering too much rebalancing.

Focus on liquidity features like bid-ask spread or order book imbalance, smooth signals over longer intervals, and normalize to reduce turnover while keeping signal quality.

Use market microstructure data (spreads, depth, imbalance) in a smoothed way to cut turnover. Aggregate to daily/weekly features instead of tick-level. Apply decay functions ( `ts_mean` , EWMA) to capture persistent effects. Rank or z-score fields to reduce outlier-driven trades. Neutralize by industry/market for stickier signals. Blend with slower factors (valuation, sentiment) to stabilize. Finally, monitor turnover directly and tune decay/truncation windows. In short:  **aggregate, smooth, neutralize, and blend**  microstructure signals to keep quality high while avoiding excessive trading.
