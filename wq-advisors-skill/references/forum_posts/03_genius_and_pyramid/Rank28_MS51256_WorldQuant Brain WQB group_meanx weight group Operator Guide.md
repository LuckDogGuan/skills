Thegroup_meanoperator in WQB calculates weighted group averages, essential for factor analysis and industry standardization. Below is a comprehensive usage guide.Syntaxgroup_mean(x,weight,group)x: Target field (e.g., factor values, financial ratios)weight: Weighting field (use1for equal weighting)group: Grouping field (e.g., industry, market cap segments)Key FeaturesGroup-Specific CalculationsComputes weighted averages for each group defined bygroup.Flexible WeightingSupports custom weights (e.g., market-cap weighting, equal weighting).Typical Use CasesIndustry standardization (e.g., industry-average P/E)Group neutralization (removing sector/style biases)Weighted metrics (e.g., market-cap-weighted returns)Usage ExamplesExample 1: Equal-Weighted Industry P/E (Harmonic Mean)# Calculate industry harmonic mean P/E1/group_mean(eps/close,1,industry)eps/close: Inverse of P/E (harmonic mean requires reciprocals)weight=1: Equal weightingindustry: Grouping fieldExample 2: Market-Cap-Weighted Industry Returns# Compute market-cap-weighted industry returnsgroup_mean(returns,market_cap,industry)returns: Stock returnsmarket_cap: Weighting by market capitalizationindustry: Grouping fieldExample 3: Custom Group Averages (e.g., Country)# Equal-weighted momentum factor by countrygroup_mean(momentum,1,country)Parameter DetailsParameterTypeDescriptionxNumericTarget field (e.g.,eps/close,returns)weightNumericWeight field.

The group_mean operator is crucial for industry standardization, enabling weighted averages and group neutralization. It’s a key tool for building robust, bias-adjusted alpha factors.

Thegroup_meanoperator in WQB calculates weighted averages within specified groups, making it essential for tasks like industry standardization and factor neutralization. It supports flexible weighting (e.g., equal or market-cap) and helps remove group-level biases from factors like momentum or valuation. Commonly used for industry- or country-level metrics, it’s especially useful in creating group-neutral alphas, such as subtracting group means to highlight stock-level deviations. For P/E ratios, use harmonic mean logic (1 / group_mean(eps/close, ...)). It’s best suited for symmetric data; usegroup_medianfor skewed distributions.
