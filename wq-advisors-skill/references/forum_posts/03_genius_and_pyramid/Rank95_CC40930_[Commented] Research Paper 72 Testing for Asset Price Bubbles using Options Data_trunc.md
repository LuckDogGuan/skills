**Abstract**

We present a new approach to identifying asset price bubbles based on options data. We estimate asset bubbles by exploiting the differential pricing between put and call options. We apply our methodology to two stock market indexes, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100, and two technology stocks, Amazon and Facebook, over the 2014-2018 sample period. We find that, while indexes do not exhibit significant bubbles, Amazon and Facebook show frequent and significant bubbles. The estimated bubbles tend to be associated with high trading volume and earning announcement days. Since our approach can be implemented in real time, it is useful to both policy-makers and investors. As an illustration we consider two case studies: the Nasdaq dot-com bubble (between 1999 to 2002) and GameStop (between December 2020 and January 2021). In both cases we identify significant and persistent bubbles.

Hi,

Can we look at this paper in the following ways?

1. In the first sentence of the abstract, the author wrote: We present a new approach to identifying asset price bubbles based on options data.

Here, the topic of interest is how to identify asset price bubbles. From my limited understanding, asset price bubbles is a quite important issue to identify in risk management.

Maybe due to some irregular, rare occurence or unsustainable cause, the price of an asset or good may increase significantly, beyond their actual demands and valuation. Those type of event could be a recent hype in new area that attract human capitals, funds and investors to allocate a significant proportion of their resources into that-area-related assets; whereas in fact, the real demand and needs for such area have yet developed and being in line with the expectations that the investors and the public have in them. This may lead to over-investment in them, maybe sooner than their actual time of development. This may lead to rapid growth in the industry, stock prices and relatied phenomenon, followed by rapid declines in stock prices, causing investors some challenges to reallocate their capital.

Another examples could be due to some unoccasional events or some irregular natural occurence, the demand for some types of goods increases significantly, leading to a rapid increase in their prices, attracting resources to invest in them. But after that types of events pass, the demand and prices of those goods adjusted accordingly back to their normal equilibrium prices, leaving a lot of those goods that have yet to be consumed, making the supply of goods larger than the actual demand, potentially leading to a not-so-potential outlook. The rapid increase and decrease of such types of goods may be reflected in the volatile movements of the respective stocks market prices. Those types of unsustainable cause may lead to the highly volatile movements in the stock markets.

During a recent financial crisis, based on some signal, some hedge funds have been able to identify the asset price bubbles and upcoming decrease in the prices, leading to their suitable careful long and short positions. Good identification of signals of asset prices bubbles can help investors to manage their risks more effectively.and make suitable investment decisions.

To identify the asset price bubbles, the author look at a highly volatile derivative instrument: options.

2. In the second sentence of the abstract, the authors wrote: We estimate asset bubbles by exploiting the differential pricing between put and call options.

There could be multiple reasons why the authors choose options instruments as a measure to identify asset bubbles.

One potential reason could options price tend to fluctuate at high magnitude, sometimes at multiple times the base stock prices. For example, if the base stock prices may change at 1-2% per day, then the respective options could change in the same directions at 2 times the change of the base stocks. This may lead to the options market may experience magnified effects of the original stock markets: The factors that affect the stock markets could have a more significant effect on the respective options price. This high volatility characteristics could make the options market more sensitive and absorb informations and signals quicker than the original stock markets.

Moreover, since the options prices change quickly, and could reach zero upon certain conditions (such as when the options  expire, or predicted price of the options may be above reach and the probability of the actual stock prices reaching the predicted stock prices at expiration dates are low), the investors may need to follow the market more frequently, trading more frequently, leading to their more aware reaction to the time's market conditions. This makes the changes or signals in the stock market zoom out and magnify the effect in the options market.

The options' price movement also reflect how realistic the outlook and expectation of the stock prices of companies at the time of the options IPO. If the expectations of the prices may be higher than the market reacted prices, then the options may react accordingly, showing a potential overvaluation of the stock prices. This overvaluation and the resulting options market movements may be some sign of asset price bubbles. Combining with the magnified effects on options market, the signal of potential asset price bubbles may be clearer upon following the price movements of options markets.

The authors stated that they estimate the price bubbles by examining the difference of call and put options price. To learn more about those 2 types of options, we can look at an articles of JPMorgan Chase's:  [https://www.chase.com/personal/investments/learning-and-insights/article/what-are-puts-and-calls#:~:text=A%20put%20option%20gives%20the,prior%20to%20its%20expiration%20date](https://www.chase.com/personal/investments/learning-and-insights/article/what-are-puts-and-calls#:~:text=A%20put%20option%20gives%20the,prior%20to%20its%20expiration%20date) .

To put it simple,

the call options is quite similar to long positions, that allow the investors to buy assets that are expected to rise in values in a period of time. This may reflect the optimistic outlook of the market, the investors may increase their assets by the increase in their instruments' prices. The call options could represent how optimistic the current institutions are about stocks at a time in the future.

and the put opions is quite similar to short positions, that allow the investors to sell the assets that are expected to decrease in values in a period of time. This may reflect the less optimistic outlook of the market, the investors may need to be more careful to protect their assets upon potential decrease in their instruments' prices. The put options could represent how careful the current institutions are about stocks at a time in the future.

The authors may estimate the pricing bubbles by the difference between put options and call options. It may mean: the smaller the difference, the closer the two estimates are, the more realistic the market and investors are about the future expectation of the stock prices, resulting in lower probability of asset prices bubbles; the lower volatility, the lower chances of the bubbles, and the higher the volatility, the higher chances of the bubbles.

3. In the third sentence of the abstract, the author wrote: We apply our methodology to two stock market indexes, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100, and two technology stocks, Amazon and Facebook, over the 2014-2018 sample period.

Here, the authors apply their methodology to examine the price bubbles of 4 data points (S&P500 (SPX), Nasdaq-100 (NDX), Amazon stock (AMZN), and Facebook (FB)) over the time from 2014 to 2018.

If we visualize the stock prices over the period from 2014 to 2018 as a 2-dimensional graph, then we also have the similar graph for S&P500 and Nasdaq-100. Then, we can treat those two indexes as an asset to examine the price bubbles.

4. In the fourth and fifth paragraph, the authors wrote: We find that, while indexes do not exhibit significant bubbles, Amazon and Facebook show frequent and significant bubbles. The estimated bubbles tend to be associated with high trading volume and earning announcement days.

Here, the authors illustrate that the prices bubbles exists in Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), and tend to be associated with high trading volume and earning announcement days.

This may help us to associate two other supporting/associating factors into our Alphas formulas: high trading volume and earning announcement days.

It is interesting to see those potentially positive characteristics could be associated with price bubbles. It could result from a momentum of overly positive expectation outlook: when the signal are positive, investors tend to overvalue the stocks, leading to a potential price bubbles.

5. In the sixth paragraph, the authors wrote: Since our approach can be implemented in real time, it is useful to both policy-makers and investors.

They shall suggest the prospective users that may be benefited from this research paper.

6. Then, to reaffirm and prove their proposed methodology, the further examined 2 cases of price bubbles:

As an illustration we consider two case studies: the Nasdaq dot-com bubble (between 1999 to 2002) and GameStop (between December 2020 and January 2021). In both cases we identify significant and persistent bubbles.

7. To sum up, the authors has helped us to find some initial ways to build quality Alphas as follows:
a. First, calculate the difference between options put prices and options call prices. (Since we may wish to long the stocks with the lowest call-put-difference options, this put-call-difference can help us).
b. Then, associate further with volume and earning announcement characteristics.

This may be realized by:
a. (put_breakeven_n - call_breakeven_n)
b. *volume, *earning_announcements (or conditioned on volume, earnings announcements, or correlation with volume, earnings_announcements).

What do you think about the above approach?

Thank you.

The paper, "Testing for Asset Price Bubbles using Options Data"  addresses an important and complex area in financial markets. Using options data to detect and analyze asset price bubbles is a novel and interesting approach. Here are some comments and questions regarding the study:

1. **Methodology:**  Could you elaborate on the specific models or frameworks employed to test for bubbles using options data? How does the approach compare to traditional bubble detection methods, such as unit root tests or log-periodic power-law models?
2. **Options Market Insights:**  Since options pricing incorporates expectations of future volatility and risk, how do you isolate the components of the options data that specifically reflect bubble characteristics as opposed to general market uncertainty?
3. **Empirical Validation:**  What datasets and time periods were analyzed to validate the proposed method? Were there any notable historical bubbles that were used as case studies (e.g., dot-com bubble, housing crisis)?
4. **Practical Applications:**  How might market participants, such as institutional investors or regulators, use the findings of this paper to make better decisions? For example, could the method provide early warning signals for emerging bubbles?
5. **Assumptions:**  What are the key assumptions underlying the models used? Are there scenarios or market conditions where the proposed method might fail or produce false positives?
6. **Market Depth and Liquidity:**  How does the depth and liquidity of the options market influence the reliability of bubble detection? Could the method be applied equally well across less liquid markets or for assets with sparse options trading?

This work has the potential to contribute significantly to both academic research and practical risk management. Additional insights on these points would be valuable in understanding the robustness and applicability of the proposed approach.

Thank you for your insightful and constructive comment. We truly appreciate your recognition of the innovative nature of our work, particularly the inclusion of expected growth as an additional factor in the q-factor model. Your suggestions for further development, such as clarifying the measurement of expected growth, conducting a comparative analysis with other asset pricing models, and exploring the interactions between factors, are all excellent avenues for strengthening the model's robustness and applicability. We agree that empirical validation and cross-model comparisons will be key to establishing the practical relevance of this approach. Your feedback is incredibly valuable, and we will take it into consideration as we continue to refine and expand upon our research. Thank you again for your thoughtful contribution!

It's fascinating how the research leverages the differential pricing between put and call options to identify such anomalies.

Building on DK20528's inquiry about the methodology, I'd like to ask: Could the authors provide more details on how they process and analyze the options data to distinguish bubble signals from other market dynamics? Specifically, how do they account for changes in implied volatility and other factors that might influence option prices, which could potentially mask or mimic bubble indicators? Additionally, what measures are taken to ensure that the detected bubbles are not just temporary market fluctuations but indeed indicative of a sustained overvaluation? Understanding these nuances could further enhance the application of this method in live trading and risk assessment strategies.

This approach to identifying asset price bubbles using options data is a valuable contribution, especially with its real-time applicability for policy-makers and investors. The findings on Amazon and Facebook exhibiting significant bubbles provide insightful market dynamics. The case studies, particularly the GameStop example, highlight the practical use of this methodology in identifying persistent bubbles.

Hey! You've got some good points there. Identifying asset price bubbles is indeed crucial in risk management. As the paper mentions, using options data is a novel way. Options are volatile derivatives and their pricing differences between puts and calls can give clues about bubbles. When there's a bubble, the options' behavior might deviate from normal. For example, unusual call or put volumes or price spreads could indicate something abnormal in the underlying asset's price. So, yeah, it's a smart approach to dig into options for spotting those bubbles.

### 评论 #8 (作者: XD81759, 时间: 1 year ago)

Hey! That research paper's quite interesting. The key idea of using options data to identify asset price bubbles is cool. Looking at the differential pricing between put and call options makes sense. For the data fields like "call_breakeven_10", it can help in estimating those bubbles. Maybe we could build a factor based on these option analytics data to spot stocks with potential bubbles in real time, just like what they did for Amazon and Facebook. That'd be useful for our strategies.

### 评论 #9 (作者: SJ17125, 时间: 1 year ago)

The paper on using options data to detect asset price bubbles offers a novel approach to this complex issue. Key questions include the models used for bubble detection and how they compare to traditional methods like unit root tests. It would be interesting to understand how the authors isolate bubble characteristics from general market uncertainty and which historical bubbles were analyzed. Additionally, insights into practical applications for investors and regulators, as well as the impact of market liquidity, would be valuable for evaluating the method's robustness. Clarifying the assumptions behind the approach could further strengthen its practical relevance.

Applying this methodology to major stock market indices, such as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100, over the period from 2014 to 2018, the study finds no significant evidence of bubbles. This suggests that, during this timeframe, these indices were priced in alignment with their fundamental values, indicating market stability at the index level.

---

### 评论 #13 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1 year ago)

In contrast, when examining individual technology stocks like Amazon and Facebook within the same period, the study identifies frequent and significant bubbles. These findings imply that, despite the overall market stability, certain tech stocks experienced price deviations from their fundamental values, reflecting localized speculative behaviors.

### 评论 #14 (作者: AT56452, 时间: 1 year ago)

The detected bubbles in Amazon and Facebook stocks are often associated with periods of high trading volumes and coincide with earnings announcement days. This correlation suggests that investor reactions to new information and heightened trading activity may contribute to the formation of price bubbles in these stocks.
