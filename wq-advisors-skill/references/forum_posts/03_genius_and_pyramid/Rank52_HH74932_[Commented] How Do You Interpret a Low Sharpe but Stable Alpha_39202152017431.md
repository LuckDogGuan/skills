Sometimes I get alphas with relatively low Sharpe ratios but stable behavior over time.

I’m not sure whether these are worth improving or if I should discard them and move on. How do you usually evaluate this kind of result?

Thank you, and I’m looking forward to hearing it from you!

I think that if your idea is backed by  **a strong economic rationale** , then you should keep that alpha. That is also the reason why the power pool is created, so that people can submit alphas below the submission threshold if those signals are distinct and have a clear hypothesis.

If sharpe is decent and idea behind that alpha is strong and return/drawdown ratio is decent and no any regime sensitivity then try to improve that.

I tend to believe that if an idea is supported by solid economic reasoning, it’s worth retaining that alpha. That’s also one of the key purposes of the power pool—it allows researchers to submit signals that may fall below standard thresholds, as long as they are genuinely differentiated and grounded in a clear, well-defined hypothesis.

This is a great question, DT49505. A low but stable Sharpe alpha can be incredibly valuable, especially if it's uncorrelated with other existing strategies. I'd be curious to understand the volatility of its returns relative to its expected return – sometimes a very tight distribution of small gains can be a more robust foundation than a few big wins with occasional significant drawdowns. Have you explored its risk decomposition or performance across different market regimes?

That's a great question that often trips up new developers. A low Sharpe but stable alpha might indicate a consistent, albeit small, edge that's less sensitive to market regime shifts. Perhaps it's worth exploring if you can scale the exposure without significantly degrading its stability, or if it can be combined with other, more volatile alphas to create a more robust portfolio. Have you looked at the drawdown characteristics alongside the Sharpe ratio?

This is a great question, DT49505! A low Sharpe but stable alpha often indicates a consistent, albeit small, edge. I'd encourage you to explore its correlation with existing strategies and its ability to diversify a portfolio. Have you looked into the drawdowns during periods of higher market stress – sometimes stability there is just as valuable as a higher Sharpe.

This is a great question, DT49505! A low but stable Sharpe can indeed be a tricky situation. My instinct is to investigate further before discarding it. Have you considered looking at the alpha's performance during different market regimes or its correlation with other factors? Sometimes, a seemingly low Sharpe can be valuable if it offers diversification or consistent, albeit small, gains that are less correlated to your existing book.

That's a great point, DT49505! A stable alpha, even with a low Sharpe, can still be valuable if its low volatility translates to a high Information Ratio relative to its risk. Have you considered looking at its downside deviation or Calmar ratio as alternative risk metrics? It might also be worth exploring if the alpha's low Sharpe is a function of high trading costs or infrequent trading opportunities that could be optimized.

This is a great question, DT49505, and a common dilemma in alpha development. I've found that a stable, albeit low-Sharpe, alpha can often be a strong building block. It might indicate robustness to market regimes. Have you explored how much diversification benefit this alpha offers, or if its low Sharpe is concentrated in specific market conditions where it degrades significantly? Sometimes, the stability itself is a valuable characteristic that can be exploited further.

Keep them — low Sharpe but stable alphas are often more valuable than they look.

What matters is  **consistency + diversification** , not just raw Sharpe.

Quick way to evaluate:

- **Check monotonicity** : are returns steadily positive across time/deciles?
- **Look at drawdowns** : shallow and controlled = good sign
- **Correlation to existing alphas** : low correlation = strong portfolio value
- **Capacity/turnover** : stable + scalable beats noisy high Sharpe

If it’s stable, robust across regions/periods, and uncorrelated →  **improve it**  (denoise, combine, or weight it).
If it’s unstable or redundant →  **drop it** .

This is a great question, DT49505, and something many of us grapple with. A low Sharpe but stable alpha could indicate a strategy with a reliable, albeit small, edge that's less susceptible to market regime shifts or tail risk. My first thought is to investigate the underlying drivers – are they based on very persistent, low-volatility relationships, or are they capturing a premium that's simply not compensated with high returns? Perhaps exploring its correlation with other stable, low-Sharpe alphas could reveal diversification benefits that, when combined, significantly improve the overall portfolio's risk-adjusted return.

This is a great question, DT49505. A low Sharpe but stable alpha often signals a reliable, albeit low-return, signal. It might be a good candidate for position sizing optimization or combining with other alphas to boost overall portfolio Sharpe. Have you considered analyzing its correlation with other signals in your portfolio to see if it offers diversification benefits?

I tend to think that if an idea is backed by strong economic intuition, it’s worth keeping. That’s also a core purpose of the power pool—allowing submission of signals that may not meet typical thresholds, as long as they’re truly differentiated and based on a clear, well-defined hypothesis.

### 评论 #14 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 2个月前)

That's a really interesting scenario DT49505. A low Sharpe but stable alpha could be a signal of a premium that's robust but perhaps small in magnitude, or one that's highly sensitive to specific market conditions. Have you tried stratifying your analysis by different market regimes or asset classes to see if the Sharpe improves in certain segments? It might also be worth considering if the risk adjustment methodology (like using volatility for Sharpe) is fully capturing the true risk profile of your alpha.
