During the process of creating an alpha, I typically set a test period of 2 years and select alphas for submission that have a performance metric of Sharpe test / Sharpe train >= 1. I eliminate alphas with a Sharpe test / Sharpe train ratio that is too high (>2) or too low (<0.3), evaluating this metric across different neutralizations. Naturally, for each region, I adjust these thresholds with slight variations. Could everyone share what methods they use to evaluate alphas before submission?

Hi, thank you for sharing!

I usually follow the TIPS suggested in the forum, using:

- Rank Test: use rank() to bracket your alphas.
- Binary Test: use sign() to bracket your alphas.

Of course, I can’t apply these tests to every alpha. If you have any suggestions on how to standardize the evaluation process, I’d love to hear them!

That's a solid strategy! Many experienced consultants use similar practices. A common method is to simulate alphas across  **multiple universes and neutralizations**  to check consistency. Ratios like  **Sharpe test/train**  help detect  **overfitting**  or unstable performance. Some also compare  **turnover** ,  **drawdown** , and  **subuniverse Sharpe**  before submission. Cross-region robustness and stable performance over rolling windows (e.g. 1Y, 2Y) are also key indicators.

To enhance alphas, I try to make simpler expressions by utilizing fewer operators and focusing on more reliable dataset which have good P/E ratio. In order to determine which neutralizing strategy offers the best balance, I further look at sector, industry, and regional approaches. In order to avoid overfitting to a limited time frame, I use caution when adjusting decay settings.

Interesting approach using the Sharpe test/train ratio as a stability filter makes sense to guard against overfitting. I also apply performance stability checks, but typically complement them with turnover, decay, and cross-validation metrics. I’d be curious to hear how others balance signal strength vs. robustness before submission.

Your method is very useful for finding balanced and reliable alphas. I also check how stable the alpha is in different market conditions and use walk-forward testing to make sure it performs well over time. Along with Sharpe ratios, I look at how often the alpha gives correct signals and how frequently it trades. I agree that adjusting the rules for each region makes sense because every market is different. Would love to know what steps others take before submitting their alphas.

That’s a really smart strategy, and it's great to see more people thinking this way! Many consultants run alphas across different universes and neutralizations to check how stable they are. Comparing Sharpe ratios (test/train), turnover, and subuniverse Sharpe before submission helps catch overfitting. Performance that holds up across regions and time windows (like 1Y or 2Y) is usually a strong sign you’ve built a solid alpha.

One thing I focus on during evaluation is how the alpha performs under simple transformations like rank and sign, similar to binary testing. I also review rolling Sharpe ratios over 6M and 12M windows to detect hidden instability. In addition to the test/train Sharpe ratio, I pay close attention to subuniverse Sharpe and turnover to avoid overly noisy or niche alphas.

Thanks so much for sharing your approach—this was super helpful! I really like how you’re using the Sharpe test/train ratio as a filter and applying thoughtful thresholds. It shows a great balance between being cautious of overfitting while still aiming for performance. Also, adjusting by region makes total sense, and it's a nice reminder that one-size-fits-all rarely works in alpha research. It’s awesome to see people openly talk about their evaluation strategies like this—it really helps the rest of us improve our own process. Appreciate you starting this conversation, and I’m definitely taking some notes from your method.

Valuable insights you've shared—especially around adjusting thresholds for different regions. I typically prefer selecting alphas that retain at least  **50% of their train period performance during the test period** , as it suggests decent generalizability. Additionally, I look for  **at least 70% performance retention in sub-universe**  tests to ensure consistency across different market segments. This balance helps filter out overfit signals while preserving alpha diversity.

To improve alphas, I simplify expressions with fewer operators, use stable datasets with strong P/E ratios, explore various neutralization methods, and adjust decay cautiously to prevent overfitting.

When creating alphas, I typically use a 2-year test period and select those with a Sharpe test/train ratio between 0.3 and 2, adjusting thresholds slightly by region. I evaluate this metric across various neutralizations before submission. I’d love to hear how others assess their alphas pre-submission!

Exactly, your approach aligns well with best practices many seasoned consultants follow. Running alphas across multiple universes and neutralizations is essential to test stability and avoid overfitting. Comparing Sharpe ratios between training and test periods gives a clear signal if an alpha is robust or too fitted to past data.

Monitoring turnover and drawdown alongside Sharpe, and validating performance across regions and different time windows (like 1-year or 2-year rolling periods), really helps confirm that your alpha isn’t just a lucky fit for a single market or timeframe.

Walk-forward testing and adapting rules per region further enhance resilience. It’d be great to hear what other consultants do in their pre-submission checklist to ensure balanced, durable alphas!
