## 帖子正文

When designing alphas, when is it more appropriate to preserve direction with  `subtract(x, y, filter = false)`  rather than using  `abs(x − y)` , and how does NaN preservation affect signal stability when chaining operators?

Use subtract(x, y, filter=false) when direction matters (spreads, long/short signals). Avoid abs(x−y) if sign is needed later. Preserving NaNs prevents missing data from becoming false zeros, improving stability, rankings, and reducing turnover when chaining operators.

I prefer  `subtract(x, y, filter=false)`  when modeling relative pressure or imbalance. Direction often drives predictability, while  `abs()`  is better suited for volatility or stress-type signals.

About the NaN handling, do we need to turn on the NaN handling in the settings or not?

Using  `subtract(x, y, filter = false)`  makes sense when the sign of the relationship carries economic meaning. Retaining direction allows the signal to distinguish between positive and negative states—such as improvement versus deterioration, cheap versus expensive, or leading versus lagging behavior. This is particularly important when the output feeds into sign-sensitive operators or long/short logic.

On the other hand,  `abs(x − y)`  removes directional information and focuses purely on the size of the divergence. This approach is better suited to hypotheses where the extent of separation matters more than which side dominates, such as measuring dispersion, stress, or disagreement between two inputs.

Great post! I've only used subtract(x, y, filter = false) before. After reading the post, I decide to try abs(x − y). I think as the main signal, subtract(x, y, filter = false) may be suitable for more scenarios, but abs(x − y) might be more practical for trading conditions.

`subtract(x, y, filter = false)`  is preferable when you want to  **preserve the economic direction**  of the signal (e.g., whether x dominates y), which is critical for cross-sectional or long/short alphas. In contrast,  `abs(x − y)`  is better when only the  **magnitude of divergence**  matters, not the sign. Preserving NaNs becomes important when chaining operators: keeping NaNs avoids injecting artificial signals where data is missing, leading to cleaner distributions and more stable alphas, whereas filling NaNs can propagate noise and distort the signal.

Using  **subtract(x, y, filter = false)**  is most appropriate when the direction of the relationship has clear economic meaning. Keeping the sign allows the signal to differentiate between positive and negative states, such as improvement versus deterioration, undervaluation versus overvaluation, or leadership versus lagging behavior. This is especially important for cross-sectional ranking, long/short construction, or any logic that depends on signal polarity.

In contrast,  **abs(x − y)**  deliberately removes directional information and focuses only on the magnitude of divergence. This is better suited for hypotheses where the size of the gap matters more than which variable dominates, such as measuring dispersion, stress, or disagreement. Preserving NaNs is also critical when chaining operators, as it prevents artificial signals from being introduced when data is missing, resulting in cleaner distributions and more stable alphas.How do you decide when directional information adds genuine economic value versus unnecessary noise in alpha design?

Use  `subtract(x, y, filter=false)`  when directionality matters for your hypothesis - for example, relative performance where being above or below a threshold has different implications. Use  `abs(x-y)`  when only magnitude matters, like volatility spreads or divergence measures. NaN preservation is critical in operator chains -  `filter=false`  propagates NaNs forward, which prevents contaminating valid data but can create gaps. This matters most with sparse data or when combining fields with different coverage. I generally use  `filter=false`  early in chains to maintain data integrity, then handle NaNs explicitly later. What's your typical strategy for NaN handling in multi-step transformations?

Great post! I’ve mostly used  `subtract(x, y, filter = false)`  before. After reading this, I’m trying  `abs(x − y)`  as well. As a core signal,  `subtract(x, y, filter = false)`  seems more broadly applicable, while  `abs(x − y)`  may be more practical under real trading conditions.

> Using  `subtract(x, y, filter = false)`  is appropriate when the sign of the relationship has economic significance. Preserving direction enables the signal to differentiate positive and negative states—such as improvement versus deterioration, cheap versus expensive, or leading versus lagging effects—which is especially important when the output feeds into sign-sensitive operators or long/short logic.
