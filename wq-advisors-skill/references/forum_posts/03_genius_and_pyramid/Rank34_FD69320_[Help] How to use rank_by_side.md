Hi Community,I am trying to explore my potential of the operators when doing the alpha, when I came to the operator rank_by_side, I read the details on operator document but I really have no idea what is the most fit scenario to use it. It would be much appreciated if anyone can help me out.Many thanks顾问 FD69320 (Rank 34)

rank_by_sideis useful when you want torank the long and short sides separately, instead of mixing everything together as standardrankdoes. This operator works well when thedistribution of positive vs. negative signals is imbalancedor when your factor has strongasymmetryand a global ranking would dilute its predictive structure. By usingrank_by_side, you preserve the signal strength on each side and maintain better control over long/short behavior.

I don't have the "rank_by_side" operator. It seems that this operator is very useful and suitable for some scenarios. Is there any way to achieve the same functionality using another operator?---------------------假如你每天都来论坛好好学习，你将会获得一个GM------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

rank_by_sideis essentially a tool for enforcingLong/Short symmetryin signals with skewed distributions. The optimal scenario is when your raw alpha has a directional bias—for instance, a momentum signal in a bull market where$80\%$of values are positive. A standardrankhere would create a massive net long exposure (high Beta).

TL60820Thanks for the insight, will take this practice.

Good points above. One extra thing worth noting: rank_by_side is especially helpful when your signal naturally produces very few negative values (or vice-versa). In those cases, a normal rank tends to drown the minority side, but rank_by_side preserves the structure on both ends so the alpha doesn’t drift into unintended net exposure. It’s also handy when testing long-only vs. short-only behaviour independently before combining them.

rank_by_side can be useful when you want to compare two signals directly and convert that comparison into a rank-based output. Instead of ranking a single series on its own, this operator looks at x and y at the same time and ranks x relative to y across the universe. This is helpful when you want to express “how strong is x compared to another feature” rather than just the raw level of x. I’ve seen it work well for pairs of related datasets, like volume vs volatility, or price change vs liquidity. It adds structure to situations where simple ranking does not capture the full relationship.

Good point.rank_by_sideis useful when your signal has very few negatives (or positives). Normal rank can drown the minority side, butrank_by_sidepreserves both ends and avoids unintended exposure. It’s also helpful for testing long-only vs short-only behavior before combining.

rank_by_sideis most useful in scenarios where your alpha naturally has an asymmetric or skewed distribution between positive and negative values, and you want to preserve meaningful structure on both the long and short sides. In a standardrank(x), all values are ranked together cross-sectionally, which can unintentionally dilute one side if, for example, 70–80% of the universe has positive values (a common case for momentum, growth, or sentiment-driven signals in bullish regimes). In that situation, the few negative observations get compressed near the bottom and lose differentiation, often leading to unintended net exposure or beta leakage.rank_by_sideaddresses this by ranking positive and negative values separately, effectively enforcing symmetry between long and short signals. This helps maintain balanced long/short behavior, improves interpretability of each side’s predictive power, and can reduce unwanted market bias. It is particularly valuable when testing alphas with strong directional bias, regime-dependent behavior, or when you want to independently validate the quality of the long and short legs before combining them into a market-neutral or balanced portfolio.

A standard rank often overwhelms the smaller side, whereasrank_by_sidepreserves structure on both tails and helps prevent unintended net exposure. It’s also helpful for isolating and testing long-only and short-only behavior before merging them into a single signal.

I'm also interested in the best use cases for rank_by_side, but I haven't had any practical experience with it. However, I'd love to see actual events or actual interactions from other people.

Therank_by_sideoperator corrects for distributional skew in alphas, maintaining Long/Short symmetry. It is particularly relevant when the raw signal exhibits directional bias, as in a bullish momentum context where a conventional ranking would yield excessive net long Beta.
