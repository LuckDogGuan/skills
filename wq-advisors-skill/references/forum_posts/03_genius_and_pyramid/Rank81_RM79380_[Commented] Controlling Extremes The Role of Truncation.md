**Why do we need Truncation?**  Financial data is noisy. Occasionally, a single stock might jump 200% in a day (e.g., a buyout rumor or a penny stock pump). If your alpha uses raw values, this single event can dominate your entire portfolio, effectively turning your diversified strategy into a bet on one stock.

**What Truncation does?**  Truncation, limits the maximum influence any single instrument can have on your signal.

**The Simulation Setting vs. The Operator**

- **Global Setting:**  In the simulation settings, you can set a "Max Weight" (e.g., 0.05). This is a hard limit enforced by the engine  *after*  your alpha is calculated.
- **Alpha Logic:**  It is often better to handle this  *inside*  your formula. By using a soft cap (like a sigmoid function) or a hard cap (like capping values at the 99th percentile), you ensure your signal distribution is healthy  *before*  the simulator even sees it.

**Practical Tip:**  If your alpha has a high Sharpe but fails due to "Drawdown," check your outliers. A single stock crashing might be dragging the whole performance down. Using  `()`  or aggressive ranking can help smooth out these "fat tails."

I agree with this. Truncation reduces extreme signal values, preventing single-stock dominance. Unlike max-weight limits, it improves signal distribution internally, leading to more stable portfolios and better drawdown control.

Nice explanation.

Truncation protects your alpha from extreme outliers. Without it, one stock can dominate the portfolio and increase drawdown risk. Using tools like  `rank()`  or  `tanh()`  helps smooth noisy signals and creates more stable, diversified performance.

Sometimes using  `rank()`  will lose much information from signals. As far as I know, using  `winscore()`  can effectively handle extreme outliers, and using  `hump(alpha, hump=0.01)`  also helps to reduce high weight of an equity. What's more, using  `if_else(abs(zscore(data)) > 2, nan, alpha)`  helps as well.
