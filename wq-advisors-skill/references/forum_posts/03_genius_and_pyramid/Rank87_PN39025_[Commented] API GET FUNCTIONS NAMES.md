Is there anyone know how to get functions' names from API. Today Genius level has been change so I could not access to some functions so I want to get them.

So could I get function as what I am doing with data now?

Thank you for your supports!

Thank you for sharing this information! It’s great to know that you’ve explored the operators and provided a helpful approach to modifying the code. I appreciate your efforts in conducting the data analysis and sharing the 54 operators. The function you've written to save the operators in a CSV format will definitely help many users access the operators more easily. It’s also great that you're considering various aspects of the platform to improve the user experience. Your contribution is valuable, and I’m sure others will find it useful. Thanks again for your hard work and for providing this insight!

I found the documentation is not complete for the API. But, what you can do use use Chrome Developer Tools, Network tab, type `api.` in the search box and you can see how the website uses the API then replicate that in your API usage.

You will find there is an `operators` api here (if that's what you are asking specifically):  [https://api.worldquantbrain.com/operators](https://api.worldquantbrain.com/operators)

Good luck.

Yes, you can retrieve function names from the API, similar to how you access data fields. You can use the API endpoint for operators or functions to query the available ones for your current Genius level. Here's a simple example in Python:

```
import requests

def get_functions(session):
    url = "https://api.worldquantbrain.com/functions"  # Replace with the actual endpoint if different
    headers = {
        'Accept': 'application/json;version=2.0',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'authority': 'api.worldquantbrain.com',
        'origin': 'https://platform.worldquantbrain.com',
        'referer': 'https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/functions'
    }
    session.headers.update(headers)

    try:
        response = session.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            functions = [item['name'] for item in data]  # Assuming 'name' is the field for function names
            print(f"Retrieved {len(functions)} functions.")
            return functions
        else:
            print(f"Failed to retrieve functions. Status code: {response.status_code}")
            print(f"Response: {response.text}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

# Example usage
# Assuming `s` is your authenticated session object
functions_list = get_functions(s)
if functions_list:
    print("Available functions:", functions_list)

```

If access restrictions are the issue, you might not be able to see all functions for higher levels. However, this approach ensures you can retrieve the list of functions available at your current Genius level.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you need more assistance

You can fetch accessible functions using the API endpoint  `https://api.worldquantbrain.com/operators` . Sending a GET request retrieves the list of operators available at your current Genius level. Use Python to automate this process, save the output as a CSV, and analyze which functions are accessible. This helps you adapt strategies based on your current access rights.

- The  **API documentation**  is the best place to start when trying to identify the functions available to you. It typically lists all the accessible functions, their parameters, and any restrictions based on access levels.
- Look for sections like  **"Available Functions"**  or  **"Methods"**  that describe the different API calls you can make.

How do you use wavelet transform methods to decompose financial time series into multi-scale components for feature extraction, and what are the advantages of wavelet denoising over traditional smoothing techniques?

When access to Operators is limited by your Genius level, you can only access the OPs you are allowed. 
The list you can access is here: Learn > Operators. 
For those OPs you cannot access, you will no longer find them! Currently, if you do not save this list, Brain has not made it public again. 
I also hope that Brain will publish more details, including a link containing all OPs, and links containing OPs for each level. It helps consultants to have a more comprehensive view.

The best way to get function names from an API is through its official documentation. API providers often list all the available functions or endpoints, along with details about how to use them.

Hi  [TN48752](/hc/en-us/profiles/13714359745431-TN48752)  , are you possibly going off-topic from the original post's question? I feel like your answer is not very relevant to the purpose of the post.

### 评论 #15 (作者: AB15407, 时间: 1年前)

Your Genius level limits your Operator access. See available OPs at Learn > Operators. 
Unavailable OPs disappear. Brain hasn't republished saved lists.

Explain the application of Fourier transform-based density estimation in non-parametric risk modeling, and how does it compare to kernel density estimation (KDE) in handling fat-tailed return distributions?

---

### 评论 #17 (作者: TN48752, 时间: 1年前)

If the alpha is generating high turnover, it might be because it’s too volatile. Try adjusting the alpha by including volatility adjustments or focusing on risk-adjusted returns instead of raw returns.

It's really helpful to see different approaches to retrieving function names from the API. The suggestion to use Chrome Developer Tools to inspect network requests is a smart workaround for identifying API endpoints. Also, the Python snippet for querying available functions is a practical way to automate the process.

### 评论 #19 (作者: NH69517, 时间: 1年前)

Absolutely, navigating API changes can be tricky! It might be helpful to consult the API documentation for updates on function names and access protocols.

### 评论 #20 (作者: PT27687, 时间: 1年前)

It sounds like you're encountering some challenges with accessing certain functions from the API. One option could be to check the API documentation for any updates or changes in the endpoints. Additionally, you could try using libraries that facilitate API interactions, as they might provide a way to list available functions more easily. Have you explored these options yet?

It seems like navigating the API can be a bit tricky, especially with the recent changes in Genius levels. Using Chrome Developer Tools to inspect API calls is a clever workaround for uncovering available functions. Have any of you tried automating this process to streamline access to function names, or do you think manual inspection is still the best way to go?
