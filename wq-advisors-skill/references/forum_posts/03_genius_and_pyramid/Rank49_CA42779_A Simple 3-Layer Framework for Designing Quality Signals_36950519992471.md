## 帖子正文

In my earlier days, I used to start by typing random formulas and hoping something works,
but as I grew into the platform, I realized strong research doesn't start with operators, it starts with a  *framework* .

Here’s my  clean 3-layer approach I use that you can apply to almost any idea.(Data → Structure → Pressure Tests)

**Layer 1 ( DATA):**

Pick One Economic Pressure to Capture Before touching code, decide the pressure you want your alpha to detect.

Examples:

- Risk aversion
- Sentiment improvement
- Liquidity stress
- Valuation reversion
- Seasonality

Then pick fields that actually represent that pressure.

Example:
Pressure → Risk aversion
Fields → rsk70_mfm2_dsrt, rsk88_mfm3, vol metrics, liquidity scores.

TIP: If your fields don’t match the pressure, the alpha will fail before you type anything.

**Layer 2 (STRUCTURE): Shape the Signal Using the Right Operators**

After choosing fields, you build the structure the mathematical “engine” around them.

Example of Key structural tools:

- rank / zscore → normalize
- ts_rank / ts_delta → extract trend or reversal behavior
- neutralization → remove industry, country, or currency bias

Good structure = stability.
Bad structure = random noise with pretty math.

Tip: keep your alpha simple (about 5 or less operations)

**Layer 3 ( PRESSURE TESTS): Check If the Idea Survives Basic Stress**

Before submitting anything, test if the idea is robust:

1. **Field swap:**  Replace one field with a close alternative. Does the logic still work?
2. **Window shift:**  Change 252 → 240 or 260. If the alpha collapses, it was fragile.
3. **Decay change:**  Try linear vs exponential decay. Robust alphas don’t collapse.
4. **Neutralization toggle:**  Check with and without sector/country neutrality to see whether the signal depends on unintended tilts.
5. **Magnitude check:**  If your alpha outputs extreme spikes, it’s unstable.

Tip :If your alpha fails 3+ of these tests, don’t submit it , fix it.

**Why This Framework Works**

It forces you to stop building “accidental math” and start building  **intentional signals** .
It helps you:

- generate ideas faster
- eliminate noise early
- produce cleaner, more stable alphas
- build a consistent research workflow

This is how you move from guessing → designing.

Let me hear your thoughts on this and also your own research workflow.

This is a very sound and pragmatic framework. I like how it emphasizes starting with economic intuition, the pressure, rather than leaping directly into coding; so many beginners do exactly the opposite, ending up with noisy alphas. The three layers, Data, Structure, and Pressure Tests create a disciplined workflow that balances creativity with rigor. I especially appreciate the stress-testing layer, which enforces robustness and discourages overfitting early. Overall, this is a great means of forcing your way out of guessing and into the design of systematic strategies.

intentional signal it is

This is a very practical and well-structured framework. I really like starting from the economic pressure instead of jumping straight into operators—it keeps the signal intentional. The pressure tests are especially useful; small changes in windows or fields quickly reveal fragile ideas. I’ve found that alphas built this way are easier to debug and tend to generalize better across regions. It’s a great reminder that good research is about process, not luck.

Quality signals comes out of such approach.

This is a very disciplined way to think about alpha research—starting from economic intuition and pressure rather than operators naturally leads to cleaner, more robust signals. The emphasis on stress testing before submission is especially valuable and mirrors how strong alphas are built in practice.

Strong framework. Defining the  **economic pressure first**  kills bad ideas early, and your pressure tests prevent accidental math. I especially like treating robustness as a gate, not a polish step.
