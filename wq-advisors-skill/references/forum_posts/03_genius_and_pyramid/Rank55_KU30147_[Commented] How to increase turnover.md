## 帖子正文

When turnover is less than 1, it can usually be increased by adjusting decay. However, sometimes this method fails, and using operators like ts_target_tvr_decay and ts_target_tvr_hump doesn't work. Are there any other methods?

Thanks.

This is a great question about a common challenge in alpha development. Beyond direct decay adjustments, have you explored incorporating volatility or momentum signals into your turnover logic? Sometimes, increasing turnover isn't just about decaying older signals faster, but also actively seeking out shorter-lived opportunities that naturally exhibit higher churn.

That's a common challenge when trying to boost alpha turnover. Have you explored adjusting the `ts_decay_mean` parameter directly or combining different decay functions in sequence? Sometimes a blend of `ts_decay_mean` with a custom EWMA using varying alpha can produce more dynamic turnover than the pre-built functions alone.

That's an interesting challenge, 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18). When decay adjustments and standard targeting operators aren't moving the needle on turnover, have you considered exploring the impact of different lookback periods on your indicators? Sometimes a shorter lookback, even with aggressive decay, can force more frequent rebalancing and thus higher turnover. Also, have you experimented with incorporating volatility or news sentiment signals as triggers for more frequent rebalancing, beyond simple price targets?

Great question, 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18)! When decay adjustments and specific target operators aren't moving the needle on turnover, have you explored introducing more short-term lookbacks or incorporating features that capture very rapid price momentum? Sometimes, augmenting the signal with components sensitive to micro-movements can naturally boost turnover if the underlying logic is aligned with capturing fleeting opportunities.

That's an interesting challenge with turnover! Beyond decay adjustments and specific targeting operators, have you considered exploring features that explicitly model rebalancing frequency or signal persistence? Sometimes, a signal might be too "sticky" and decay alone can't introduce the desired turnover if the underlying price action isn't providing enough new information to trigger frequent trades. I'm curious to hear what others have tried!

### 评论 #9 (作者: TL72720, 时间: 3个月前)

Great question, 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18)! When decay adjustments don't budge turnover, it often points to the underlying signal's persistence or sensitivity to regime shifts. Have you explored introducing more dynamic rebalancing triggers, perhaps based on realized volatility or a rolling correlation threshold, as an alternative to fixed decay parameters? Sometimes a signal that's too "sticky" needs a more adaptive exit strategy.

### 评论 #10 (作者: LD13090, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a common challenge! Beyond decay adjustments, have you explored incorporating regime-switching logic or considering different lookback periods for your turnover calculation? Sometimes, simply averaging turnover over different timeframes can reveal opportunities to boost it when it's otherwise sluggish.

### 评论 #11 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a common challenge, 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18)! Beyond decay adjustments, have you experimented with incorporating different lookback periods or combining multiple signals with varying turnover characteristics? Sometimes averaging signals with very different turnover profiles can help nudge the overall turnover up without drastically compromising signal quality.

### 评论 #12 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting challenge with turnover! Beyond adjusting decay parameters, have you explored incorporating time-series features that directly capture momentum or mean reversion dynamics, perhaps by leveraging different lookback windows or employing more complex lookback transformations? Sometimes, a subtle shift in how you define the lookback window or the target itself can unlock that desired turnover.

### 评论 #13 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 3个月前)

Hey 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18), interesting challenge with turnover. Beyond decay, have you experimented with factors that inherently have higher turnover, like short-term sentiment or news-driven price movements? Sometimes adjusting the lookback windows on your existing factors or introducing new ones with faster reaction times can also push turnover up.

### 评论 #14 (作者: NM98411, 时间: 3个月前)

顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18), that's a common challenge when trying to boost alpha turnover. Beyond decay adjustments, have you explored incorporating factors that inherently have higher turnover, or perhaps looked into regime-switching logic that could dynamically adjust the decay parameters based on market conditions? It might be worth considering how the lookback periods of your target functions interact with the underlying price dynamics as well.

---

### 评论 #15 (作者: HT71201, 时间: 3个月前)

Beyond tweaking decay parameters, have you tried adding time-series features that directly capture momentum or mean reversion—like varying lookback windows or using more advanced transformations? Sometimes small changes in how the lookback or target is defined can help achieve the desired turnover.

Hi 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18), that's a common challenge when trying to boost alpha turnover. Beyond decay parameters, have you explored incorporating factors that explicitly capture regime shifts or mean-reversion dynamics that might be shorter-lived? Sometimes, a combination of feature engineering that highlights volatility or short-term price action, even if not directly "turnover" related, can indirectly drive it by forcing more frequent rebalancing.

---

### 评论 #17 (作者: TP19085, 时间: 3个月前)

Hi 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18), interesting point about turnover. Have you explored the impact of lookback periods in your target functions? Sometimes a slightly longer lookback for `ts_target_tvr_decay` or `ts_target_tvr_hump` can effectively influence turnover when direct decay adjustments aren't yielding the desired results, especially if the underlying signal persistence varies.

---

### 评论 #18 (作者: TL72720, 时间: 3个月前)

That's a common challenge when alpha decay isn't behaving as expected! Beyond direct decay adjustments, have you explored the impact of different lookback periods or interaction terms with other factors that might be influencing turnover indirectly? Sometimes, a more complex relationship exists than a simple linear decay adjustment can capture.

---

### 评论 #19 (作者: NM32020, 时间: 3个月前)

That's a common challenge when trying to optimize alpha decay! Beyond `ts_target_tvr_decay` and `ts_target_tvr_hump`, have you explored introducing more dynamic decay functions or perhaps incorporating features that directly capture changing market regimes, which might influence optimal turnover timing? Sometimes, a simpler approach like adding a small constant positive term to the decay factor can also nudge turnover up without drastically altering the alpha's core logic.

### 评论 #20 (作者: LD13090, 时间: 3个月前)

Hi 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18), interesting challenge! When standard decay adjustments aren't moving the needle on turnover, have you considered exploring the impact of different lookback periods or perhaps incorporating dynamic weighting schemes that might naturally increase interaction frequency? It could be that the signal's underlying behavior is less about gradual decay and more about more episodic or fluctuating relationships.

---

### 评论 #21 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting problem! Beyond decay adjustments, have you explored how different rebalancing frequencies or the inclusion of alternative data sources might influence turnover? Sometimes, a slight increase in noise sensitivity via specific lookback periods on a signal's components can also naturally boost turnover if the signal is capturing shorter-lived patterns.

---

### 评论 #22 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting challenge! Beyond `ts_target_tvr_decay` and `ts_target_tvr_hump`, have you explored using time-series functions that focus on shorter lookback periods or perhaps incorporating regime-switching logic? Sometimes, a higher turnover alpha might implicitly be sensitive to more rapid market shifts that these alternative approaches could capture.

Either by increasing or decresing decay or by operators like abs.

---

### 评论 #24 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 2个月前)

顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18), that's a common challenge when decay isn't fully addressing turnover. Have you experimented with combining `ts_target_tvr_decay` with other time-series operators that might introduce more dynamic rebalancing, perhaps something that reacts more aggressively to recent signal strength changes? Another avenue could be exploring how your feature's signal-to-noise ratio impacts turnover, as higher noise might naturally lead to lower turnover if decay is too smooth.

---

### 评论 #25 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 2个月前)

This is a common challenge when aiming for higher turnover! Beyond direct decay adjustments, have you considered exploring how factors like signal correlation or specific asset classes might be implicitly suppressing turnover? Sometimes, a high-level view of your factor universe can reveal constraints you might not see at the individual operator level.

---

### 评论 #26 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 2个月前)

Interesting challenge with `ts_target_tvr_decay` and `ts_target_tvr_hump` not doing the trick! Have you explored adjusting lookback periods or considering how different state definitions in `ts_delta` or `ts_delay` might influence turnover, especially if you're aiming for a specific rebalancing frequency? Sometimes a subtle change in the signal's persistence can have a big impact.

### 评论 #27 (作者: DT49505, 时间: 2个月前)

Hi 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18), that's a common challenge when trying to boost alpha turnover. Beyond decay adjustments, have you explored incorporating features that inherently capture shorter-term dynamics, like volatility breakouts or very short moving average crossovers? Sometimes a fundamental shift in feature engineering, rather than just parameter tuning, can unlock higher turnover.

---

### 评论 #28 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 2个月前)

Interesting challenge, 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18)! Beyond decay parameters, have you considered how factors like signal persistence or the inherent volatility of the underlying assets might be capping turnover? Sometimes, trying to force turnover higher can inadvertently lead to trading friction. Perhaps exploring shorter lookback periods or incorporating real-time market signals could also be avenues?

---

### 评论 #29 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 2个月前)

Hey 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18), interesting problem with turnover. Beyond decay adjustments, have you considered exploring different signal horizons or incorporating volatility-based weighting to influence trade frequency? Sometimes, the underlying signal's behavior itself might be the bottleneck.

---

### 评论 #30 (作者: NN29533, 时间: 2个月前)

Interesting challenge, 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18)! When decay adjustments and standard TVR operators aren't moving the needle, have you explored the impact of different lookback periods or introducing other types of momentum/mean-reversion signals that might be complementary to the underlying factors driving your current alpha? It's often about finding the right blend of factors to capture shorter-term dynamics.

---

### 评论 #31 (作者: DT49505, 时间: 2个月前)

Interesting challenge, 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18)! When standard decay and hump functions aren't moving the needle on turnover, have you considered exploring non-linear time-series operators or perhaps incorporating features that are themselves highly sensitive to price changes, like short-term momentum indicators scaled differently? Sometimes, a more fundamental shift in how you're capturing transient signals can unlock higher turnover.

---

### 评论 #32 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 2个月前)

Hey 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18), interesting challenge! Beyond decay parameters, have you explored incorporating factors that directly capture rebalancing needs or regime changes? Sometimes, increasing turnover might stem from a signal not being persistent enough, and looking at attributes like sentiment shifts or macroeconomic indicators could indirectly drive more frequent trading.

---

### 评论 #33 (作者: NM32020, 时间: 2个月前)

Hey 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18), interesting challenge with turnover! Beyond decay adjustments, have you explored introducing alpha components that intrinsically have higher turnover, like those focusing on very short-term price momentum or intraday patterns? Also, are you observing if the issue stems from the alpha's signal strength itself or the portfolio construction's weighting scheme?

---

### 评论 #34 (作者: DT49505, 时间: 2个月前)

Hi 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18), interesting problem! When standard decay and hump functions aren't moving the needle on turnover, have you explored strategies that actively *force* turnover by, for instance, incorporating a lookahead term or a condition that triggers rebalancing on specific market events rather than solely relying on time decay? It might be worth investigating if the alpha itself inherently exhibits low turnover characteristics that these methods struggle to overcome.

---

### 评论 #35 (作者: MT46519, 时间: 2个月前)

Hi 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18), interesting challenge! Beyond decay adjustments, have you considered exploring interactions with other features, or perhaps incorporating different lookback periods within the time-series operators themselves? Sometimes adding a bit more "noise" or signal variation through these avenues can nudge turnover higher when direct decay methods plateau.

---

### 评论 #36 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 2个月前)

Hi 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18), interesting challenge! Beyond decay adjustments, have you explored incorporating factors that are known to have higher short-term price sensitivity or momentum? Sometimes a broader feature universe or different lookback periods within existing momentum indicators can inherently boost turnover by identifying more transient opportunities.

---

### 评论 #37 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 2个月前)

That's an interesting challenge with turnover. Beyond decay adjustments, have you considered exploring different lookback windows for your turning point indicators or perhaps incorporating regime-switching logic that might inherently drive higher turnover during specific market conditions? Sometimes a subtle shift in how you define a "significant" price movement can also unlock the turnover you're seeking.

---

### 评论 #38 (作者: ML46209, 时间: 2个月前)

Interesting challenge! Beyond decay adjustments, have you considered exploring lookback windows for your turnover-targeting operators? Sometimes, a different lookback can better capture the underlying dynamics that lead to higher turnover. Also, have you experimented with combining multiple operators with different decay/hump profiles to see if that achieves the desired effect?

`group_cartesian_product`  can be very useful — trust me.
As a side note, alphas with turnover below 1% can sometimes be very good. In that case, rather than forcing turnover mechanically, it may be better to lift it above 1% by blending in other well-behaved signals. — JZC

### 评论 #40 (作者: HN47243, 时间: 2个月前)

Hi 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18), I've also found decay adjustments can be surprisingly sensitive. Beyond `ts_target_tvr_decay` and `ts_target_tvr_hump`, have you explored strategies that involve explicit rebalancing triggers based on a factor's performance or conviction score, rather than solely relying on time-based decay? Sometimes a more dynamic approach to turnover can circumvent the limitations of fixed decay parameters.

### 评论 #41 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 2个月前)

Hi 顾问 JL16510 (Rank 18), that's a common challenge when trying to boost alpha turnover! Beyond decay adjustments and specific operators, have you explored incorporating different lookback periods or considering alphas that explicitly target shorter holding periods within their logic? Sometimes, re-parameterizing existing features with shorter horizons can also implicitly increase turnover without directly manipulating decay.

[JC84638](/hc/en-us/profiles/28348489344151-JC84638)  Good points, very helpful!

By the way, here group_cartesian_product requires some new groups made by bucket(), right?
