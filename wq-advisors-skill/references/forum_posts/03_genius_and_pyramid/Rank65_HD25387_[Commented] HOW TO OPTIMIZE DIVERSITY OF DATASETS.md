Hi everyone,

It's tough to complete the 'Pyramid' with less conventional datasets like Sentiment or Social Media, especially compared to the usual suspects like Analyst, Fundamental, Model, or Price Volume. What are your strategies and best practices for boosting your alpha diversity?

Try using simple alpha expressions with fewer operators , especially group neutralize Operator

To optimize dataset diversity—especially with unconventional ones like sentiment or social media—try combining them with stable datasets (e.g., fundamentals), apply normalization (e.g.,  `ts_zscore` ), and diversify neutralization settings. Focus on unique signal logic and low correlation across alphas to strengthen your Pyramid.

Great question — I’ve found that  **planning alpha ideas around the dataset first**  (instead of the logic) helps shift away from overused signals. For example, with Sentiment or Social Media, I try to isolate what’s unique (e.g., volume of mentions vs. tone vs. acceleration) and build expressions that highlight that. It also helps to avoid defaulting to complex combinations — simpler expressions with clean dataset focus tend to score better on diversity. I use tools like  `group_rank`  or  `quantile`  instead of heavier operators like  `group_neutralize`  to keep things lightweight. Lastly, reviewing the structure of my past alphas helps avoid duplication and pushes me to explore new signal types.

Yes, it’s definitely tough to complete the pyramid, especially with less conventional datasets. One approach that works well is to first come up with a basic alpha idea and then experiment with different implementation methods using the Brain API. This way, you can apply the same core logic across various datasets, helping you diversify more efficiently and move toward completing your pyramid.

Great topic, To improve dataset diversity, I try to mix stable sources like fundamentals and analyst data with new ones like social media or sentiment. I check how each dataset performs on its own before combining them. It’s important to scale them properly so one doesn’t overpower the other. Testing on different stock groups and time periods helps avoid overfitting. Also, I keep updating my data sources to catch new trends. Would love to hear what others are doing too.

Boost dataset diversity by pairing alternative data with stable inputs, using  `ts_zscore`  for normalization, and varying neutralization settings. Keep signal logic unique and alpha correlations low to reinforce Pyramid strength.

Try creating alphas across different regions - this naturally boosts diversity even with similar datasets. Hit the API systematically to explore unconventional datasets like sentiment/social media/shortinterest etc. data. Use group operators and creative combinations to transform common data in novel ways. Take successful patterns from traditional datasets and adapt them to these less conventional sources.

Try use less and simple operators,

On otherhand less operators contribute to a good value of operators per alpha

Really insightful tips here — I’ve also found that the  **key to boosting dataset diversity is starting from the dataset, not the formula** . With unconventional sources like sentiment or social media, I ask:  *what unique signal does this dataset offer that others don’t?*  Even a basic idea, like the rate of change in sentiment tone, can score well if it’s distinct. I also try to  **limit operator count**  and avoid repeating similar structures from past alphas. Small changes in neutralization and signal logic can make a big difference for Pyramid credit.

Optimizing the diversity of datasets is essential for improving model generalization, reducing bias, and ensuring fairness—especially in machine learning and AI applications. Here's a comprehensive guide depending on your context:

I think you should prioritize using functions related to time series.

Great question! I’ve found that with unconventional datasets like Sentiment or Social Media, it helps to focus on capturing relative changes (e.g., spikes or reversals) rather than absolute levels. Pairing them with more stable domains like fundamentals or price trends can also boost alpha diversity. Also, using techniques like rank blending, residuals, or clustering can help highlight unique, low-correlation signals. Keep experimenting—those unconventional sources often shine when markets are noisy!

Great advice! Exploring alphas across multiple regions definitely adds natural diversity, even when working with similar datasets. Systematically tapping into alternative data sources like sentiment, social media, or short interest can open up unique opportunities. Using group operators and creatively transforming familiar data helps uncover fresh signals. Adapting proven patterns to unconventional datasets is a smart way to expand alpha variety and potential.

To boost diversity, try creating alphas across different regions—even using similar datasets, this naturally increases variety. Systematically explore unconventional data like sentiment, social media, or short interest by hitting APIs and applying group operators or creative combinations to transform common data in novel ways. Mixing stable sources like fundamentals and analyst data with newer ones such as social sentiment is effective; always test each dataset individually before combining, and scale them properly to avoid dominance by any single source. Testing across different stock groups and time frames helps prevent overfitting, while regularly updating data keeps you aligned with new trends. Planning alphas around datasets instead of logic encourages fresh ideas—isolating unique aspects like volume, tone, or acceleration in sentiment data leads to simpler, cleaner signals that score better in diversity. Using lightweight tools like group_rank or quantile rather than heavy operators keeps alphas efficient. Reviewing past alpha structures helps avoid repetition and sparks exploration of new signal types.
