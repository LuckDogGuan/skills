Hi everyone,

I hope this post finds you all doing well.

I’m reaching out to the community to seek your advice on estimating one’s current rank in the Genius Program, specifically after considering the tie-breaker criteria. While I’ve crossed the eligibility benchmarks (Signals, Pyramids Completed, Combined Alpha Performance, etc.), I am curious to know where I stand, especially in comparison to others after the tie-breaker criteria are applied.

The tie-breaker criteria include:

1. **Avg Distinct Operators/Alpha**  (Lower is better)
2. **Avg Distinct Fields/Alpha**  (Lower is better)
3. **Total Distinct Operators**  (Higher is better)
4. **Total Distinct Fields**  (Higher is better)
5. **Community Leadership** , such as:
   - Forum Likes (on posts/comments of 100+ characters)
   - Successful Referrals
6. **Maximum Simulation Streak**

I’d love to hear from anyone who has found effective ways to estimate their rank or track progress. Specifically, I am looking for tips or methods to identify ranking based on these metrics and any insights into tools or techniques (e.g., data scraping, API analysis, or leaderboard navigation) that can help approximate rankings.

Additionally, if anyone has analyzed the Genius leaderboard systematically (e.g., using percentiles or other calculations), I’d be grateful if you could share your approach.

Lastly, it would be great if the administrators could consider introducing a progress dashboard or rank estimation tool for participants to gain a better understanding of their standing without revealing sensitive leaderboard information.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and suggestions!

Hi, you can get the api  [https://api.worldquantbrain.com/consultant/boards/genius?limit=30&offset=30&&aggregate=user](https://api.worldquantbrain.com/consultant/boards/genius?limit=30&offset=30&&aggregate=user)  to call all the data and then use python language to sort the array and calculate the rank of the criteria. Good luck!

Get the genius table data via api, calculate the score based on tie break (rank the indexes and divide by 6) and sort by percentage of slots

Hi  [SC43474](/hc/en-us/profiles/5163496266135-SC43474) ,

I’m also unsure how to calculate the tie-breaker criteria when there are too many people at the same level. Additionally, if someone meets the requirements for a level but does not meet the tie-breaker criteria, will they be compared with individuals at a lower level?

I hope WorldQuant can provide clarification on this matter.

Below is the code I’ve collected for retrieving the Genius ranking table:

```
import timeimport pandas as pddef leaderboard(s, limit=100, offset=0):    """    Function gets leaderboard for competition and returns it as a DataFrame.    """    max_try = 5    leader_list = []    for x in range(offset, limit + offset, 100):        for _ in range(max_try):            result = s.get(                f"https://api.worldquantbrain.com/consultant/boards/genius?limit=100&offset={x}&aggregate=user"            )            if 'results' in result.json():                break            else:                time.sleep(5)        leader_list.extend(result.json()['results'])    if not leader_list:        return pd.DataFrame()    return pd.DataFrame(leader_list)leaderboard_table = leaderboard(s,limit  = 5000,offset = 0)leaderboard_table
```

While you may not have access to a precise ranking until it’s officially updated, assessing your community engagement, alpha performance, pyramid status, and recent contributions will give you a fairly good sense of your standing relative to the competition. If you’re confident that you’ve crossed all eligibility thresholds, focusing on boosting your community activity or ensuring consistent alpha performance can help solidify your rank after tie-breakers are applied.

I agree, it's frustrating to not be able to see the actual rank beforehand. We only get ranks based on number of signals, which isn't the tiebreaker.

Hi,

I think for grandmaster and master categories, it all boils down to the tie-breakers. There are more consultants eligible for grandmaster than the slots for master and grandmaster combined, I think, based on recent updates on the FAQ.

Great post! It’s fantastic that you're looking for ways to track your progress in the Genius Program. It can be tricky to estimate where you stand, especially with the tie-breaker criteria. One way to start could be keeping a log of your own metrics like distinct operators and fields per alpha and then comparing with the community's benchmarks. Also, leveraging data scraping or API analysis could give you a more precise understanding of your standing. A progress dashboard would definitely be a useful tool to visualize your performance! Best of luck in your journey!

Hi SK72105, Actually, I don't understand clearly how to calculate the rank of WorldQuant's tie-breaker criteria to be able to calculate it accurately. We hope WorldQuant will soon come up with the most reasonable ranking method.

[顾问 PN39025 (Rank 87)](/hc/en-us/profiles/1532011933942-顾问 PN39025 (Rank 87))  Hi, you can run this code with the code of 顾问 NA80407 (Rank 63).

# Only extract table data with > 60 alphas

qualified_table = leaderboard_table.loc[leaderboard_table['alphaCount']> 60]

# Sort table by fieldAvg in ascending order

field_per_alpha_table = qualified_table.sort_values(by='fieldAvg',ascending=True).reset_index(drop=True)

# Replace the .... by your ID

my_rank = field_per_alpha_table[field_per_alpha_table['user'] == '....'].index

if len(my_rank) > 0:

print(f" Your position about fieldAvg is {my_rank[0] + 1} in  {len(qualified_table)} users who submitted > 60 alphas ")

else:

print("Can't found user's name ")

### 评论 #27 (作者: AK40989, 时间: 1年前)

Utilizing the API to gather data and then sorting it based on the tie-breaker criteria is a smart approach. Have you considered how the community leadership metrics, like forum engagement and successful referrals, might influence your overall standing? Balancing these qualitative aspects with the quantitative metrics could provide a more comprehensive view of your rank and help you strategize effectively.

"Great question! Estimating rank after tie-breakers is tricky since some metrics aren’t directly visible. Tracking  **distinct operators/fields per alpha** , forum likes, and referrals manually can help. Some use  **data scraping or API calls**  (if available) for leaderboard insights, while percentile analysis may offer estimates. A  **progress dashboard**  would be a great addition for clarity. Looking forward to more insights!"
