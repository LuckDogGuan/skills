Nan_mask is more like technical operator for filtering. It would be hard to find alpha using only this operator  as it reduces coverage by replacing some alpha weights with nan.

You should use in 2 cases:

- To cut outliers by replacing extreme values to nan.

Something like nan_mask(alpha, 5-abs(group_zscore(alpha,market))). Here we replace values to nan if it alpha have more then 5 standard deviations far from average.

- Inside aggregation operators.

Example: ts_mean(nan_mask(returns, returns), 5)

We find average returns, but only it is positive

alpha – group_min(nan_mask(alpha, rank(alpha)-0.05), group)

We subtract min value over group ignoring bottom 5% of alpha values

This is a great explanation of  *nan_mask* , and I like how you highlighted its role as a technical operator rather than a standalone alpha generator. One important point is that nan handling is often underestimated in alpha design—bad values or outliers can silently bias signals and make backtests unstable. By using  *nan_mask* , we can explicitly control which data points are included in aggregation or time-series functions, effectively “pre-cleaning” the signal before transformation. I especially like your example of cutting outliers beyond ±5 standard deviations—it’s a simple but effective safeguard. Another useful trick is to combine  *nan_mask*  with liquidity or volatility filters, so that illiquid names or extreme price jumps don’t distort results. For group-based operations, it’s also powerful to selectively exclude bottom or top percentiles, making the factor more robust and less tail-driven. In practice, mastering operators like  *nan_mask*  helps make alphas more stable, cleaner, and ultimately more production-ready.

Thank you for taking the time to explain how to use  *nan_mask*  with such clear examples. Many consultants know the operator exists but aren’t sure how to apply it effectively, so your post really fills that gap. I appreciate that you didn’t just give the definition but also shared concrete cases—outlier removal, time-series aggregation, and group operations. That level of detail makes it much easier to see practical applications. Personally, I found your group example especially insightful, since ignoring the bottom 5% of values is a clever way to avoid distortions from extreme cases. Posts like this are very valuable because they help demystify technical operators and turn them into useful tools for alpha construction. Thanks again for sharing your knowledge—it contributes a lot to the community’s collective learning.

I found your group example particularly insightful; ignoring the bottom 5% of values is a clever way to reduce distortions caused by extreme cases. Posts like yours are incredibly valuable because they demystify technical operators and turn them into actionable tools for alpha construction.

Thank you again for sharing your expertise—it makes a real contribution to the community’s collective learning.

That makes a lot of sense. Thanks for breaking it down—using  `nan_mask`  as more of a filtering tool rather than a standalone alpha operator really clears things up. The examples with outlier removal and group-level adjustments are especially helpful. I’ll try experimenting with it inside  `ts_`  and  `group_`  operators to see how it affects stability.

Thanks for explaining nan\_mask with clear examples. Showing practical uses like outlier removal, time-series aggregation, and group operations—especially ignoring the bottom 5%—helps turn this technical operator into a valuable tool for alpha construction.

Thanks for sharing these examples of how  *nan_mask*  can be used. One question I have is about choosing thresholds—when filtering outliers, how do you decide whether 3, 5, or another number of standard deviations is the right cutoff? Another thing I’d love to hear is whether you find  *nan_mask*  more effective in volatile regions like CHN, where outliers appear more frequently, compared to stable universes like USA. Your post is already very clear, and exploring these nuances could make it even more valuable.

Great explanation – especially the use cases for outlier handling and within group/time-series aggregations. The example with  `nan_mask(alpha, 5 - abs(group_zscore(alpha, market)))`  is particularly helpful. Would be interesting to hear more about how people balance the trade-off between noise reduction and coverage loss when using  `nan_mask` . Anyone tried dynamic thresholds instead of fixed cutoffs?

Great question! In my experience, the “right” threshold for  `nan_mask`  often depends on the balance between robustness and signal retention. A tighter cutoff (e.g., 3σ) aggressively removes extreme values, which can stabilize out-of-sample performance but risks discarding meaningful signals in volatile regions like CHN. A wider cutoff (e.g., 5σ) preserves more of the raw signal, which can help in calmer markets like the USA, but may let through occasional noise spikes. I usually start with 3–4σ as a baseline, then stress-test across different windows and universes to see how sensitive the alpha is to extremes. Volatile regions often benefit from dynamic or slightly looser thresholds, or from combining  `nan_mask`  with other smoothing/decay operators to reduce the impact of sudden outliers without removing too much information.

Absolutely! The trade-off with  `nan_mask`  is always between removing extreme noise and preserving enough coverage to keep your alpha informative. Fixed cutoffs like 3σ or 5σ are easy to implement, but they can either over-clean in volatile regions or under-clean in stable ones. Dynamic thresholds—adjusting the σ level based on recent volatility, universe dispersion, or even group-level stats—can help strike a better balance. For example, using a rolling volatility estimate to scale the cutoff ensures that outlier removal is proportional to current market conditions. Another approach is combining  `nan_mask`  with smoothing operators (like  `ts_mean`  or decay) so extreme values are softened rather than completely zeroed, preserving some informational content. In practice, I usually test a few variants in parallel to see which setup maintains OS robustness without unnecessarily shrinking the active universe.
