## 帖子正文

Hello everyone, currently Genius accounts are ranked by criteria, according to Genius content, the number of operators and the number of datasets in each rank are different. This article of mine will guide you how to get Operators, export to csv file using Python and python libraries. I also guide you how to get the results of datafields in a certain datasets. I know most people in the forum have knowledge about technology, this article will be for some of you low-tech, hope it will help everyone.

1. Install Python, IDE Python and package requirements

- Install Python (Macos/Windows/Ubuntu):   [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install IDE: Pycharm Community, Jupyter Notebook,...
- Install Package: Pandas (Processing data table), requests (Call API).

2. Get Operators using Api

When you log in to your account, you will receive an authentication token. You use this authentication token to call the API and get data.

```
import requestsimport jsonimport osimport pandas as pdbear_token = ""headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + bear_token}# Call api get list operatorsoperators = requests.request("GET", 'https://api.worldquantbrain.com/operators', headers=headers, data={})# Operators type jsonoperators = json.loads(operators.text)# dictionary datadata = {'name':[], 'category': [] ,'definition': [], 'description': []}# Xử lý các opeartorsfor op in operators:    # operator name    data['name'].append(op['name'])    # operator category: time series, logic, vv     data['category'].append(op['category'])    # operator definition    data['definition'].append(op['definition'])    # operator description    data['description'].append(op['description'])# Convert operator to dataframe, export file csvdf = pd.DataFrame(data)df.to_csv('op.csv', index=False)
```

Depending on the usage needs, people can process and analyze Operators according to their ideas.

3. Get a list result field in datasets

```
import requestsimport jsonimport osdef count_field_dataset(dataset, region, universe, delay, token):   # count number field in dataset   url = f'https://api.worldquantbrain.com/data-sets/{dataset}'   headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}.    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers).    if response.status_code == 200:       json_data = response.json()        for data_ in json_data['data']:          if data_['region'] == region and data_['universe'] == universe and data_['delay'] == delay:              return int(data_['fieldCount'])          else:               return 0def get_dataset_wq(dataset, region, universe, delay, token):    # get result data field in dataset    data = []    base_url = "https://api.worldquantbrain.com/data-fields"     headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}    number_data = count_field_dataset(dataset, region, universe, delay, token)    offsets = range(0, number_data, 50)    for offset in offsets:        url = f"{base_url}?dataset.id={dataset}&delay={delay}&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=50&offset={offset}&order=-userCount&region={region}&universe={universe}"         response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)         if response.status_code == 200:            data.append(response.json())        else:           return []    return dataif __name__ == "__main__":    bear_token = ''    data = get_dataset_wq(dataset='pv1', region='USA', universe='TOP3000', delay='1', bear_token)    
```

After having the data fields in the dataset, you can freely process and save the results as in part 2.

This function is a brilliant way to fetch personalized operators dynamically! It handles API integration well, saves the results as a CSV for future use, and includes detailed error logging for debugging. With indents corrected, it becomes even more readable and functional. Enhancements like handling authentication fallback, pagination for large operator lists, or adding a delay to avoid API rate limits could make it even more robust. A great tool for customizing Genius workflows!

The step-by-step process for fetching operators is well-structured, with clear instructions on how to parse and organize the data into a dictionary and export it to a CSV. However, the explanation for handling the  `operators`  JSON object could benefit from a brief note on how to deal with possible API errors or malformed data for robustness.

### 评论 #7 (作者: MA97359, 时间: 1年前)

Hello, does this extract all the operators listed, or only the ones we have access to?

---

### 评论 #8 (作者: TP14664, 时间: 1年前)

It's great that you're sharing a guide to help others get started with Python for Genius accounts! I’ll walk through the steps you've mentioned and provide additional clarifications for the less tech-savvy individuals who might need it.

### 评论 #9 (作者: NM98411, 时间: 1年前)

Did you incorporate Expected Tail Loss (ETL) optimization rather than traditional mean-variance approaches to account for non-normality in asset return distributions?

---

### 评论 #10 (作者: KS69567, 时间: 1年前)

That’s a great idea! Using  **Python**  to interact with the  **Genius API**  is a smart way to retrieve and analyze operator data efficiently. The combination of  **`requests`**  for API calls and  **`pandas`**  for data processing makes it both  **accessible**  and  **scalable**  for different users.

### 评论 #11 (作者: KS69567, 时间: 1年前)

Clear instructions on how to parse and arrange the data into a dictionary and export it to a CSV file are included in the well-organised, step-by-step procedure for retrieving operators. For robustness, the description of how to handle the operators JSON object, however, might benefit from a quick mention on how to handle any API failures or invalid data.

- This technique is useful for missing or undefined values. By neutralizing "None" values, you can ensure that they don't affect the calculations or cause errors in your model.
- Simulating expressions with neutralization (i.e., treating "None" as a neutral value) can give a clear indication of how these missing values will influence your alpha model’s output.

### 评论 #13 (作者: PL15523, 时间: 1年前)

This is a scaling factor. It is used to control the magnitude of the  `limit`  that will be imposed on the values of  `alphavalues` . The logic here is that instead of allowing the model to scale the values of  `alphavalues`  arbitrarily,  `hump`  sets a boundary for the maximum adjustment based on the cross-sectional sum of  `alphavalues` .

Is there a more efficient way to retrieve a large number of operators or dataset fields, such as batch processing or pagination?

---

### 评论 #15 (作者: LR13671, 时间: 1年前)

Are there any common data transformations or preprocessing steps needed before using this data in machine learning models?

---

### 评论 #16 (作者: NM12321, 时间: 1年前)

@ [MA97359](/hc/en-us/profiles/1533214021361-MA97359)

Right. It has provided all the operators and datasets you have access to in genius based on your authentication token.

### 评论 #18 (作者: NT29269, 时间: 1年前)

[LR13671](/hc/en-us/profiles/4516642748055-LR13671)  Using the above API will retrieve all operators without needing pagination. Additionally, if you are referring to retrieving data fields with pagination, you can send requests with query parameters  `offset`  and  `limit` . After each completed request, you should increase the  `offset` , allowing you to scan all data fields in the dataset.

### 评论 #19 (作者: VL52770, 时间: 1年前)

[LR13671](/hc/en-us/profiles/4516642748055-LR13671)

The data returned from the API is an array of objects like this:

{ "name": string, "category": string, "scope": string[], "definition": string, "description": string, "documentation": string, "level": string, }

How you transform this data before feeding it into the model depends on your specific use case. You can create your own custom calculation functions similar to those on the platform.

In physics and fluid dynamics, averaging helps understand motion and flow patterns, such as the mean velocity of fluid particles. Similarly, in machine learning, the mean vector represents the central tendency of high-dimensional data, aiding in more structured analysis.

In trading, focusing on the top 200 stocks enhances liquidity, mitigating slippage and execution difficulties. A smaller, more liquid universe also reduces market noise, making it easier to identify genuine signals and improve decision-making
