Sharpe measures the excess return (or risk-adjusted return) per unit of deviation in the returns of an Alpha.

**Sharpe = Average of PnL / Standard deviation of PnL.**

The higher the Sharpe ratio or the Information Ratio (IR), the more stable the Alpha’s returns are likely to be, and consistency is an ideal characteristic. The minimum requirement for the Sharpe ratio on the BRAIN platform is above 1.58.

### 1. Ways to improve Sharpe:

- Improve Returns
- Reduce Volatility

#### 1.1. Reduce Volatility:

- Create Groups (using group operators like group_rank, group_zscore, etc.)
- Use templates combining multiple operators (e.g., rank(group_rank(x, subindustry))).

#### 1.2. Improve Returns:

- Use technical analysis tools: RSI, Bollinger Bands.
- Combine more than one signal (though not highly recommended due to potential conflicting signals).

the more consistent the returns are, it is more likely to pass sharpe test

Your post on passing the Sharpe test is spot on and provides valuable insights for those looking to enhance their Alpha's performance metrics. Here are a few additional thoughts on the topic:

1. **Understanding Sharpe Ratio** :
   - You've rightly pointed out that the Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return. It's crucial for distinguishing an Alpha's performance from the randomness of the market.
2. **Improving Sharpe** :
   - **Returns** : Enhancing the average return of an Alpha is essential. This can be achieved by refining the signals or by focusing on market conditions that historically yield higher returns.
   - **Volatility** : Reducing the volatility of returns can be approached by smoothing out the Alpha's signals or by diversifying across less correlated assets.
3. **Strategies to Reduce Volatility** :
   - **Grouping** : As you mentioned, using group operators can help in reducing the idiosyncratic risk associated with individual securities.
   - **Complex Templates** : Combining multiple operators can help in creating a more robust Alpha that is less sensitive to outliers.
4. **Strategies to Improve Returns** :
   - **Technical Analysis** : Tools like RSI and Bollinger Bands can provide additional signals that might enhance the Alpha's predictive power.
   - **Signal Combination** : While combining signals can be tricky due to potential conflicts, a well-calibrated multi-signal approach can potentially improve performance.
5. **Additional Tips** :
   - **Backtesting** : Extensive backtesting can help in understanding how different market conditions affect the Alpha's performance.
   - **Risk Management** : Implementing risk management techniques can help in curbing large drawdowns, thereby improving the Sharpe ratio.

Your post is a great starting point for a broader discussion on Alpha optimization. I encourage community members to share their experiences and strategies for navigating the Sharpe test. It would be interesting to hear more about real-world applications and any innovative approaches that have been successful.

Keep up the good work, and I look forward to more insights from you and others in the community.

To reduce volatility (drawdown), you can use neutral techniques to neutralize risk (grp_neut, vector_neut, regression_neut,...) For return, increasing decay is a quite effective way, besides doing alpha on low liquidity universe

Thanks, TN74933 for this informative post. I want to add that when adding two signals, you can use a trade when the operator to ensure that the trigger occurs only when both signals are moving in one direction. For instance, let's say you have two signals, `alpha1` and `alpha2`. The condition `(rank(alpha1) - 0.5) * (rank(alpha2) - 0.5) > 0` ensures that you enter a trade only when:

- Both signals indicate upward movement (`rank(signal) > 0.5`), or
- Both signals indicate downward movement (`rank(signal) < 0.5`).

This approach can help create alphas with better Sharpe ratios.

- **Focus on Individual Signal Robustness**:
  - Combining signals can increase operator count, leading to overfitting.
  - Overfitting reduces out-sample performance.
  - Prioritize improving individual signals before combining them.

For improving single signals you can give this a try:

- **Triggering on Extreme Values**:
  - Use `abs(rank(alpha) - 0.5) > 0.3` for individual signals.
  - Ensures trades are triggered only when the signal is at extreme values, avoiding ambiguity.

- **Trying various Neutralization Settings**:

- Try using Fast Factors Neutralization, it usually increases Sharpe, though turnover also increases.

Can you show more examples on how exactly do you make it on BRAIN because I find it quite difficulty implementing your ideas in large scale.

Great tips! Improving the Sharpe ratio can really make a difference in enhancing an alpha’s performance. I’ve found that focusing on reducing volatility is key, especially when using operators like  **group_rank**  to segment stocks by industry or sector. This allows you to manage risk more effectively.

Additionally, combining signals can be helpful, but I agree it’s important to avoid overfitting by keeping an eye on correlations between them. Using technical indicators like  **RSI**  and  **Bollinger Bands**  to fine-tune entries and exits can also smooth out returns and boost the Sharpe ratio.

I’d also suggest testing different timeframes for your signals to see if more stability can be achieved with longer or shorter periods. Thanks for sharing these strategies!

There are some thresholds that people should do to get good alpha: sharpe > 2.5, turnover between 10 - 25%, return/drawdown > 2, margin > 5bps

### 评论 #14 (作者: ND68030, 时间: 1年前)

To improve sharpe using pv data, you can simply weight stocks with higher liquidity, or use cap to weight stocks with higher capitalization.

Here is the example for using multiple operators:

**<group_compare_op>(<ts_compare_op>(<company_fundamentals>, <days>, <group>)** 
 **group_rank(ts_rank(data_fundamental,60),industry)**

Hi  [HN71281](/hc/en-us/profiles/5123610062359-HN71281) , I think you can use this:

```
Avg_gain = ts_mean(close>0? close : 0), 14); Avg_loss = ts_mean(close<0? -close : 0), 14); RSI = (100 - 100 / (1 + Avg_gain/Avg_loss)); alpha = -rank(Ts_Rank(close, 5));RSI < 30? alpha + 0.1*abs(alpha): alpha
```

I'm not sure if this is the best approach, however feel free to give some recommendations!

Hey guys! Regarding using price volume to improve Sharpe, like  [ND68030](/hc/en-us/profiles/9496734822295-ND68030)  said, we can weight stocks by higher liquidity or capitalization. For using RSI in alpha as  [HN71281](/hc/en-us/profiles/5123610062359-HN71281)  asked, we could use it as an additional signal. For example, when RSI shows overbought or oversold, it might trigger trades. But watch out for overfitting when combining signals. Backtesting helps see its real impact on robustness.

This approach to identifying asset price bubbles using options data is a valuable contribution, especially with its real-time applicability for policy-makers and investors. The findings on Amazon and Facebook exhibiting significant bubbles provide insightful market dynamics. The case studies, particularly the GameStop example, highlight the practical use of this methodology in identifying persistent bubbles.

To improve Sharpe ratios, enhance returns by refining signals or targeting favorable market conditions and reduce volatility by smoothing signals or diversifying assets. Use  **grouping**  to lower idiosyncratic risk and  **complex templates**  for robustness. Apply tools like RSI for better signals, backtest thoroughly, and manage risks to minimize drawdowns.
