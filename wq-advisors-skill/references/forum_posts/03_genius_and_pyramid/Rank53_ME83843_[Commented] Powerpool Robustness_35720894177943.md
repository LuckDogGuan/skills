Hey everyone, i want to ask like what measures should we consider to check if our pure powerpool alpha will perform good in OS like for pure PP sharpe>1 no fitness threshold , no is ladder test, so how one can determine that it will perform good in OS? Would like to hear your tips and advices.

maybe you could take rank test and sign test into consideration

Great question — for pure PowerPool alphas (no fitness threshold, no IS ladder), OS stability really depends on how robust your signal generation process is. Here are a few things that help me gauge if an alpha might generalize well in OS:

1. **Cross-segment consistency:**
   Check how your alpha behaves across multiple datasets and regions. If the performance (Sharpe, turnover, decay profile) stays consistent, that’s usually a strong sign it’s not overfitted.
2. **Self-correlation and decay behavior:**
   A balanced self-correlation (not too high, not too low) and a smooth decay curve can indicate your alpha captures a persistent effect rather than noise. Avoid sharp performance drops at small delays.
3. **Signal diversity:**
   Compare your alpha’s correlation with other strong PPs or alphas you’ve built. Low correlation + steady individual Sharpe often means your alpha adds unique information, which tends to hold up OS.
4. **Distribution sanity check:**
   Plot or review the raw signal distribution. Extreme skewness or spiky signals are often unstable OS. A more uniform or normally distributed signal tends to generalize better.
5. **Stress testing:**
   Slightly perturb parameters (like lookback periods) or randomize part of the input — if performance remains in the same ballpark, that’s a good sign of robustness.

Basically, treat OS as a robustness test rather than a continuation of IS. A “clean” alpha with consistent logic and behavior across variations usually performs better than one with a sharp IS edge but fragile structure.

Would you like me to make the reply soun
