At first, I ignored “operator count,” thinking it was just a side metric. But in Genius competitions, it can decide tie-breaks.

Some tricks to increase operator count without changing logic:

- Use  **longer equivalents**  (e.g.,  `ts_sum(x,d)/d`  instead of  `ts_mean` ).
- Add  **extra normalization**  like  `zscore`  before ranking.

Small adjustments, but sometimes they’re exactly what you need to edge ahead in Genius rankings.

Interesting point. Do you think operator count should matter only in competitions like Genius, or can it also indirectly improve robustness by forcing more transformations?

The number of operators on uses reflects the amount of research they are involved in. Research sometimes is trial and error to achieve some idea one has, so the more you use a lot of different operators to come up with different alpha ideas, the more you are involved in more research. So, WorldQuant prefers Quants to engage in more research, and thus, you become valuable when you have a large number of operator counts. Hence, the more the  ***operator count***  in your  ***Genius profile*** , the more opportunities are offered here in Brain.

Let's focus on more research and a lot of quantitative analysis through alphanation.

Cheers!!! ^^JN

Interesting question—operator count isn’t just a competition metric. While in Genius it’s explicitly monitored, keeping it moderate can also improve robustness: fewer operators reduce overfitting risk, make the signal easier to interpret, and prevent noise amplification. At the same time, strategic transformations can enhance stability, so it’s really about balancing simplicity with meaningful adjustments.

Interesting point—operator count isn’t just a metric. Fewer operators reduce overfitting, improve interpretability, and limit noise, while strategic transformations can enhance stability. The key is balancing simplicity with meaningful, robust signal adjustments.
