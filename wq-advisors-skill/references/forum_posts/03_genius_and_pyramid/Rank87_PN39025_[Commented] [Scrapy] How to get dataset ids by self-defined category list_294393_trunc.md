## 帖子正文

Hello there,

When I want to have a general knowledge of the data, I found that I cannot get all the dataset ids from the code I've got, so I need to figure this out by myself, then I got one function to extract dataset ids by defined category/category list. Here follows the process:

Firstly, if you wanna use this to some certain category combination, you need to define your own category list. As a case, I collected all the categories in WQB and put them into a list:

```

category_list = [

'analyst', 'earnings', 'fundamental', 'imbalance', 'insiders',

'institutions', 'macro', 'model', 'news', 'option',

'other', 'pv', 'risk', 'sentiment', 'shortinterest', 'socialmedia'

]

Assume that I need to scrape all the datasets of all the categories, this is the function:

def get_category_datasets(
    s,
    category_list,
    instrument_type='EQUITY',
    region='USA',
    delay=1,
    universe='TOP3000'
):
    """
    Fetch datasets for multiple categories from the WorldQuant Brain platform.

Args:
        s (requests.Session): An active requests session for making requests.
        category_list (list): List of categories to fetch datasets for.
        instrument_type (str): Type of instrument, e.g., 'EQUITY'.
        region (str): Region of the data, e.g., 'USA'.
        delay (int): Delay parameter for the API query.
        universe (str): Universe of the data, e.g., 'TOP3000'.

Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: Combined DataFrame of all datasets for the given categories.
    """
    all_data = []
    base_url = " [https://api.worldquantbrain.com/data-sets](https://api.worldquantbrain.com/data-sets) ?"

    for category in category_list:
        print(f"Fetching datasets for category: {category}")
        # Construct the URL with the current category
        url = (
            base_url +
            f"instrumentType={instrument_type}&region={region}&delay={delay}" +
            f"&universe={universe}&category={category}"
        )
        try:
            # Make the request
            result = s.get(url)
            result.raise_for_status()  # Ensure request is successful
            # Parse the JSON response
            datasets = result.json().get('results', [])
            for dataset in datasets:
                dataset['category'] = category  # Add the category for context
                all_data.append(dataset)
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Error fetching data for category {category}: {e}")

    # Convert to a DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(all_data)
    return df

```

Notice: you must set a country, because for different regions, you are probably get different datasetids by same category list, so region is a necessary input.

P.S. The returned df of this function contains lots of info, you could just pivot it to more simplified dataframes for your own research.

Get a list result field in datasets

```
import requestsimport jsonimport osdef count_field_dataset(dataset, region, universe, delay, token):   # count number field in dataset   url = f'https://api.worldquantbrain.com/data-sets/{dataset}'   headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}.    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers).    if response.status_code == 200:       json_data = response.json()        for data_ in json_data['data']:          if data_['region'] == region and data_['universe'] == universe and data_['delay'] == delay:              return int(data_['fieldCount'])          else:               return 0def get_dataset_wq(dataset, region, universe, delay, token):    # get result data field in dataset    data = []    base_url = "https://api.worldquantbrain.com/data-fields"     headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}    number_data = count_field_dataset(dataset, region, universe, delay, token)    offsets = range(0, number_data, 50)    for offset in offsets:        url = f"{base_url}?dataset.id={dataset}&delay={delay}&instrumentType=EQUITY&limit=50&offset={offset}&order=-userCount&region={region}&universe={universe}"         response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)         if response.status_code == 200:            data.append(response.json())        else:           return []    return dataif __name__ == "__main__":    bear_token = ''    data = get_dataset_wq(dataset='pv1', region='USA', universe='TOP3000', delay='1', bear_token)    
```

After having the data fields in the dataset, you can freely process and save the results as in part 2

Focusing on the top 200 stocks enhances liquidity, which helps mitigate issues like slippage or challenges in executing trades. By concentrating on a smaller, more liquid group of stocks, market noise is reduced, making it easier to identify and respond to authentic trading signals. This streamlined approach improves the efficiency of executing trades and allows for more reliable decision-making in dynamic market conditions.

- **Use of Derivatives** : If your strategy involves hedging, using efficient instruments like options or futures (rather than direct buy/sell of underlying securities) can be more cost-effective.
- **Risk Parity** : Maintain an optimal risk-to-reward ratio in your positions. This may help in reducing the need for frequent rebalancing.

To extract dataset IDs based on your self-defined category list, you can use the function you've created, which allows you to fetch datasets for each category. By defining your own `category_list` and specifying the region, instrument type, and universe, the function retrieves the datasets and combines them into a DataFrame. How do you handle situations where the API request fails or returns incomplete data—do you implement retries or log the issues for later review?

This function offers a powerful and dynamic way to fetch personalized operators using the WorldQuant Brain API. It not only integrates seamlessly with the API but also saves results as a CSV for future use and includes detailed error logging for debugging. The post provides a solid introduction for beginners, outlining essential steps from installing Python and necessary libraries to extracting operators and data fields and exporting results. Code snippets enhance practical implementation, though slight improvements in clarity and organization could make them even more user-friendly. Further enhancements, such as handling authentication fallback, implementing pagination for large datasets, or adding a delay to prevent API rate limits, would make this tool even more robust. A great asset for customizing Genius workflows .
