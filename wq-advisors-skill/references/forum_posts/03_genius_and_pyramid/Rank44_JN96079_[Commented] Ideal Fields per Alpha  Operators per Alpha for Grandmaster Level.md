I noticed on the leaderboard this quarter that for consultants at Grandmaster level, the values of Fields per Alpha and Operators per Alpha are quite low.

What would be the ideal range for these metrics to help in beating the tie-breaker criteria when competing for Grandmaster? Would keeping them lower generally give an advantage, or is there a balanced sweet spot to aim for?

Would love to hear thoughts from others.

If your goal is to become a GRANDMASTER, I recommend focusing on 2-3 fields and incorporating 4-5 operators per alpha. This approach strikes a good balance, keeping your alpha manageable and less prone to overfitting. It also enhances its explainability.

The Field per alpha and operators per alpha as a tie breaker not only helps you to get to grandmaster but also helps in achieving other metrics, such as CAP and CSAP, for your portfolio. In having the two, i.e., filed per alpha, and operator per alpha low, it means that your alphas are capable of keeping their PnL predictions even in the OS, since having a high number of the two per alpha is just a way to overfit, in a way that your alpha only achieves IS but may become even poorer in the OS.

Therefore, it is crucial to have the two,  **Fields/Alpha**  and  **Operators/Alpha** , as low as possible, <=2 and <5, respectively, as a better way forward.

Great observation! From what I’ve seen, keeping fields and operators lower often signals simplicity and robustness, which can help in tie-breaks. But the “sweet spot” is usually balance—too low may underfit, too high risks overfitting. Curious to hear how others optimize these metrics.

For the tie-breaker at Grandmaster, lower complexity (fewer fields and operators per alpha) is generally an advantage because it signals efficiency and robustness. However, going too low can hurt signal strength if the alpha becomes overly simplistic. The sweet spot many aim for is keeping operators in the 5–15 range and fields in the 10–30 range, while making sure the alpha still shows strong Sharpe, low correlation, and solid OS stability.
