I think you should start with vec_avg or vec_sum operators because it is easy to get a good signal when used with the other normal operators but i would suggest that once you are comfortable using these operators you can search the other vector operators mostly they are statistical in nature so if you want to use other operators you should have a clear picture in mind of what you want to do with the data , then you can go and read operator descriptions and try them. Hope this helps .

For basic usage of vector fields I just treat them like any other fields, but add a `vec_avg(VEC_FIELD)` around it. You can try that if you don't want to think about it. Otherwise, the `vec_` operators are your friend.

Vectors are datasets with high volatility and when you want to use them in the platform, you have to use the vec operator to convert them into a matrix. When converting them to a matrix, they will be like normal operators. I often use them with time operators quite effectively.

Begin with simple vector operators like  `vec_avg` ,  `vec_sum` ,  `vec_min` , and  `vec_max` , as they are straightforward and effective when paired with normal operators. After gaining confidence, explore more advanced vector operators, ensuring you have a clear purpose and refer to their descriptions for better understanding.

It's recommended to begin your exploration of vector operators with  `vec_avg`  or  `vec_sum` , as these functions generally provide strong initial signals when combined with other standard operators. However, it's crucial to approach other vector operators with a clear understanding of your data analysis goals.

Since many vector operators have a statistical foundation, carefully consider the specific insights you aim to extract from your data before diving into their descriptions and implementations. This methodical approach will ensure that you effectively utilize the power of vector operators to achieve your desired analytical outcomes.

Vector data fields work well with operators like  `ts_mean` ,  `ts_std_dev` ,  `rank` , and  `zscore`  for calculating averages, volatility, and normalized rankings. Example:  `rank(close / ts_mean(close, 20))`  ranks stocks by deviation from their 20-day average price. Use these to create signals for trends, momentum, or outliers effectively.

Using  **vector data fields**  effectively involves selecting operators that leverage their structure and properties. Vector fields typically represent a single value for each stock or entity across a snapshot in time. Here are some suggestions and examples:

### **1️⃣ Operators for Vector Data Fields:**

#### **a. Basic Arithmetic Operators:**

- Use addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division to derive meaningful comparisons or ratios.
- **Example:**
  ```
  earnings_to_price = earnings / price
  ```
  If  `earnings`  and  `price`  are vector fields, this calculates the earnings-to-price ratio.

#### **b. Statistical Operators:**

- **Mean ( `mean` )** : Calculates the average across entities in the vector field.
- **Standard Deviation ( `std_dev` )** : Measures the dispersion in the vector.
- **Z-Score ( `zscore` )** : Normalizes the values for comparison.

**Example:**

```
earnings_zscore = zscore(earnings)

```

Identifies stocks with earnings significantly above or below the group average.

#### **c. Ranking and Sorting Operators:**

- **Rank ( `rank` )** : Ranks values in ascending or descending order.
- **Percentile ( `percentile` )** : Determines the relative position of a value within the group.

**Example:**

```
high_dividend = rank(dividend_yield)

```

Ranks stocks by their dividend yield within the vector.

#### **d. Group Operators (for Segmented Analysis):**

- Apply group-level analysis using  `group_rank` ,  `group_mean` , or  `group_zscore` .
- **Example:**
  ```
  sector_rank = group_rank(earnings, sector)
  ```
  Ranks earnings within sectors.

#### **e. Logical Operators:**

- Combine multiple conditions to create filters.
- **Example:**
  ```
  filter_dividend = (dividend_yield > 5) & (pe_ratio < 15)
  ```
  Selects stocks with high dividend yield and low price-to-earnings ratio.

### **2️⃣ Example Application:**

Let’s say you’re working with a vector field  `analyst_recommendation`  (e.g., buy/sell ratings).

**a. Transform Data:**

```
rec_score = rank(analyst_recommendation)

```

Converts recommendations into ranks for easier comparison.

**b. Combine with Other Fields:**

```
combined_signal = rank(earnings_growth) + rank(analyst_recommendation)

```

Combines earnings growth and analyst recommendation ranks into a composite signal.

**c. Segment Analysis:**

```
sector_signal = group_zscore(combined_signal, sector)

```

Normalizes the signal within sectors for a fair comparison.

### **Final Thoughts:**

For vector data fields, the best operators depend on your goal:

- Use  **arithmetic and statistical operators**  for basic transformations.
- Employ  **ranking and group-based operators**  for segmentation and comparison.
- Combine these to build meaningful, actionable alphas.

Experiment with combinations to find insights unique to your dataset! 🚀

Using vector data fields can be powerful for alpha generation, especially when working with data points that are organized in a time series or for cross-sectional analysis. Vector data fields consist of individual elements that are typically not directly related to one another, but they can be analyzed using operators designed for such data structures.

Hey PT88153! As a fellow tech enthusiast, I totally get the struggle with vector data fields. It's pretty cool that you want to dive in! I recommend starting with the `vec_avg` and `vec_sum` operators as they make it easier to gauge general trends without overthinking. You could also explore combining them with more traditional functions like z-score or rank to strengthen your insights! Just remember, clarity of purpose is key—figure out what you want your signals to reveal. Happy analyzing!

For working with vector data fields in WorldQuant BRAIN, start with basic operators like  `vec_avg()`  and  `vec_sum()`  to aggregate values. Use statistical functions like  `zscore()` ,  `rank()` , and  `group_*`  operators for normalization and segmentation. For advanced signals, combine vector operators with time-series functions ( `ts_mean()` ,  `ts_rank()` ). Ensure clarity in vector usage to avoid noise and optimize efficiency.

- **`vec_choose(x, nth=k)`** : Selects the  `k` -th element from the vector field  `x`  (0-based index).
  *Use case:*  Extracting the most recent or specific forecast.
- **`vec_count(x)`** : Returns the number of elements in the vector field  `x` .
  *Use case:*  Measuring analyst coverage for a stock.
- **`vec_max(x)`** : Identifies the maximum value within the vector field  `x` .
  *Use case:*  Finding the most optimistic target price.
- **`vec_min(x)`** : Identifies the minimum value within the vector field  `x` .
  *Use case:*  Determining the lowest estimate in earnings forecasts.
- **`vec_percentage(x, percentage=0.5)`** : Retrieves a specific percentile value from the vector field  `x` .
  *Use case:*  Finding the median ( `0.5`  percentile) estimate.
- **`vec_sum(x)`** : Computes the sum of all elements in the vector field  `x` .
  *Use case:*  Aggregating total recommendation counts or earnings estimates.

These operators help extract meaningful insights from vector-based financial data efficiently.
