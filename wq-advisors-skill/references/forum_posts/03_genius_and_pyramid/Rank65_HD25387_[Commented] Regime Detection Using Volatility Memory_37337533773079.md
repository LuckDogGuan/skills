## 帖子正文

Instead of using raw volatility levels, I’ve started tracking  **how long ago volatility peaked**  using  `ts_arg_max(vol, N)` .
Stocks that recently exited high-vol regimes behave very differently from those in prolonged calm periods.
This has helped separate true mean-reversion from false breakouts.
The signal works best when ranked cross-sectionally.

Volatility memory captures regime transition timing, not just intensity. Using ts_arg_max(vol, N) distinguishes assets recently exiting stress from those in persistent calm, improving separation of genuine mean reversion from unstable breakouts. Ranked cross-sectionally, this timing signal acts as a regime filter, enhancing robustness by conditioning alpha behavior on volatility lifecycle rather than level alone.

Clever use of  `ts_arg_max`  - tracking regime recency rather than just levels is underutilized. Have you experimented with combining this with the magnitude of the peak itself, something like  `ts_arg_max(vol, N) * ts_max(vol, N)` ? I found that distinguishing between 'recently exited moderate vol' vs 'recently exited extreme vol' adds another useful dimension. What lookback window N worked best for you?

This is a very elegant idea with strong market intuition. Using  **volatility memory**  via  *ts_arg_max(vol, N)*  effectively distinguishes stocks that have  **recently exited a high-vol regime**  from those stuck in prolonged low-vol conditions—states that tend to exhibit very different price dynamics. Applying it cross-sectionally makes a lot of sense, as it shifts the signal from absolute levels to  **relative regime positioning** , reducing common-mode noise. It’s a clean way to separate genuine mean reversion from false breakouts driven by temporary volatility compression.

Would the optimal lookback window (N) systematically differ across assets with varying liquidity (e.g., large-cap vs. small-cap stocks)? Looking forward to the author sharing more findings on parameter sensitivity and cross-asset applicability.

Thank you for sharing this incredibly creative and effective technique! Utilizing  `ts_arg_max(vol, N)`  to track the  **temporal distance since a volatility peak**  is a masterclass in adding a time-dimension to regime analysis.

By shifting from "how much" volatility exists to "when" it occurred, you are effectively capturing the  **decay of market anxiety** . This approach is brilliant for distinguishing between a "cooling" asset that is ready for mean reversion and one that is still in the middle of a chaotic breakout. Using the time-since-peak as a feature allows the alpha to respect the  **microstructure recovery period**  that stocks often need after a liquidity shock. Ranking this cross-sectionally is the perfect final touch, as it isolates the assets that are furthest along in their stabilization process relative to the rest of the market. This is a highly sophisticated, path-dependent logic that adds a significant layer of robustness to any alpha library.

Really like this “volatility recency” framing. Conditioning signals on  *when*  volatility last peaked, rather than its level, seems to capture regime transitions much more cleanly. I’ve also seen it work best cross-sectionally, where relative regime position matters more than absolute timing.
