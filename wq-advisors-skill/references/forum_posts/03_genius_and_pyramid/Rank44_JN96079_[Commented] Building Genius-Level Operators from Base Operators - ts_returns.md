In this series, we learn how to construct advanced Genius-level operators using only base operators. This way, you can still implement powerful ideas even without direct access to higher-level functionality.

🔹 Today’s focus (Fifth Operator in the Series): ts_returns
The ts_returns operator is used to calculate returns of a time series over a rolling window. It measures the relative change of a value compared to its past value (delayed by d steps).

It can be defined in two modes:

Mode 1 – Simple Return:

**ts_returns (x, d, mode = 1) = (x – ts_delay(x, d )) / ts_delay(x, d)**

This calculates the percentage change relative to the delayed value.

Mode 2 – Symmetric Return :

**ts_returns (x, d, mode = 2) = (x – ts_delay(x, d )) / ((x + ts_delay(x, d))/2)**

By combining basic operators (-, /, +, and ts_delay), you can easily construct ts_returns. This operator is essential for measuring growth, momentum, and performance trends in time-series data.

Stay tuned—this is the fifth operator in the series. More Genius-level operator breakdowns are coming soon. Keep experimenting and happy learning!

Nice one! Building ts_returns from just delay and basic math ops really shows how flexible the base toolkit is. I’ve mostly used mode 1 for momentum-type signals, but mode 2 gives smoother behavior in volatile series. Curious which mode you all prefer in practice?

This breakdown of  `ts_returns`  as a Genius-level operator is very useful, especially because it shows that even complex-looking functionality can be constructed from just a few base operators like  `ts_delay` , subtraction, addition, and division. I think an important point to highlight is the choice between Mode 1 (simple return) and Mode 2 (symmetric return). The symmetric version is particularly valuable in financial time series because it reduces the impact of extreme values and provides a more balanced perspective, especially when dealing with volatile instruments or low-priced securities. For example, in cases where the denominator might approach zero, Mode 1 can produce extreme spikes that distort signal stability, while Mode 2 helps normalize the behavior by scaling relative to the midpoint of current and delayed values. Another extension could be combining  `ts_returns`  with operators like  `purify`  or  `ts_zscore`  to filter noise and standardize across instruments. It would also be interesting to see comparisons of performance between these two modes across different asset classes (equities, FX, commodities) to understand in which contexts each mode produces more robust signals.

Great breakdown! Reconstructing  **ts_returns**  using base operators really shows how flexible the platform is. Both modes are useful—Mode 1 for simple momentum measures and Mode 2 for symmetry adjustments. Looking forward to the next operator in the series!

Combining with  `purify` / `ts_zscore`  for noise reduction and standardization sounds powerful, and cross-asset comparisons would be super insightful.

Mode 1 vs. Mode 2 is key—symmetric returns really help tame volatility and avoid denominator distortions

Really helpful breakdown, I like how you showed that even advanced operators like  **ts_returns**  can be built step by step using only basic operators. The clear explanation of both modes makes it easy to see the difference between simple return and symmetric return, and why each might be useful. It’s a good reminder that powerful signals don’t always need complex shortcuts understanding the logic behind them is more important. This approach not only boosts learning but also helps in customizing operators when direct ones aren’t available. Excited to see the rest of the series and learn from more examples like this.

Really like how you broke down  `ts_returns`  into base ops — it demystifies a lot of the “Genius” operators. Mode 1 feels natural for momentum and growth-type alphas, but Mode 2 really shines when you want to avoid those denominator blow-ups in volatile or low-priced names.

I’ve found that layering  `ts_returns`  with  `ts_zscore`  or  `purify`  helps strip noise and makes the signal more cross-sectionally comparable. Would be interesting to see side-by-side tests of Mode 1 vs Mode 2 across asset classes — my guess is Mode 2 adds more stability in FX/commodities, while Mode 1 can still capture the edge in equities where drift dominates.

Reconstructing ts_returns from the base operators really showcases the platform’s flexibility. Each method has its strengths: Mode 1 is great for clean momentum strategies, while Mode 2 adds balance through symmetry adjustments.

Rebuilding  `ts_returns`  using base operators really highlights the platform’s versatility. Each mode offers unique advantages: Mode 1 works well for straightforward momentum strategies, whereas Mode 2 introduces symmetry adjustments for a more balanced signal.

This breakdown of  **ts_returns**  is an excellent example of how Genius-level operators can be reverse-engineered from base operators, which is incredibly useful for both learning and practical application. The distinction between Mode 1 (simple returns) and Mode 2 (symmetric returns) is particularly important. Mode 1 is intuitive and aligns well with momentum-based signals, but it can become unstable when dealing with low denominators or volatile instruments. Mode 2 helps mitigate these issues by scaling relative to the midpoint, which smooths out extreme values and often leads to more robust performance in turbulent markets. From a modeling perspective, an interesting extension would be to combine  **ts_returns**  with  **purify**  or  **ts_zscore** , thereby filtering noise and standardizing across instruments. I also think cross-asset testing is crucial—equities may favor Mode 1 due to drift dominance, while FX and commodities might benefit more from the stability of Mode 2. Understanding these trade-offs deepens our ability to construct resilient alphas without over-relying on built-in operators.

Great explanation! 👌 I like how you showed that ts_returns can be built step by step using only simple tools. Mode 1 works well when we just want to see basic growth or momentum, while Mode 2 is useful when things are more volatile since it gives a smoother picture. Really nice breakdown—it makes the concept easy to understand and apply. Excited to see the next operator in this series!

I also found the suggestion to layer ts_returns with purify or ts_zscore particularly valuable. These combinations can help reduce noise and improve cross-sectional comparability, which is crucial when working with diverse asset classes. It makes sense that Mode 1 might perform better in equities, where drift dominates, while Mode 2 provides stability in FX or commodities with high volatility.

### 评论 #16 (作者: SG91420, 时间: 9个月前)

The ability to recreate the basic return and symmetric return using only base operators, such as subtraction, division, and ts_delay, is quite helpful. Even in the absence of direct access to the Genius-level operator, this greatly simplifies the process of working with growth and momentum signals.

Great breakdown of ***ts_returns*** —a perfect example of how Genius-level operators can be built up from base operators. The Mode 1 vs. Mode 2 distinction is key: Mode 1 fits momentum signals but can get unstable in volatile assets, while Mode 2 smooths extremes and improves robustness. Combining  ***ts_returns***  with tools like purify or  ***ts_zscore***  could further filter noise and standardize signals across instruments. Also, worth testing cross-asset—equities may favor Mode 1, while FX/commodities might benefit more from Mode 2’s stability.
