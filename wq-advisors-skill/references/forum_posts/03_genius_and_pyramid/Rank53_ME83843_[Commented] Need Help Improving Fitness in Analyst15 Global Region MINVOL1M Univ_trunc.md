Hi everyone,

I’m working with the  **Analyst15 dataset**  in the  **Global region**  using the  **MINVOL1M universe** . While testing different alphas, I’ve noticed that most parameters — such as  **Sharpe, turnover, returns, and drawdown**  — are showing good results.

However, the  **fitness**  value consistently remains  **very low** , even when other metrics look strong.

Has anyone in the community faced a similar issue or found ways to improve  **fitness**  specifically for the  **Analyst15 dataset** ? Any insights, operator combinations, or template adjustments would be really helpful.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions!

Thanks for sharing your experience,It’s interesting that your other metrics look strong but fitness stays low. It might be worth exploring more diverse operator combinations or tweaking template parameters to better capture the dataset’s nuances. Also, sometimes fitness can be sensitive to specific alpha behaviors or data quirks in Analyst15. Has anyone tried normalizing inputs differently or incorporating alternative fitness functions? Would love to hear what worked for others.

That’s a great observation — the  **Analyst15 dataset**  can sometimes produce exactly that pattern: strong performance metrics (Sharpe, turnover, returns) but unexpectedly  **low fitness** . This usually happens when the signal performs well in certain sub-periods or segments but lacks  **consistency across the full backtest window**  or  **diversity across instruments** .

Here are a few things that might help improve fitness:

1. **Check cross-sectional stability:**
   Try running your alpha with slightly different universes . If performance varies sharply, your logic might be over-tuned to a subset of names. Adjusting normalization or scaling operators (like  `rank()` ,  `zscore()` , or  `ts_zscore()` ) can help improve stability.
2. **Reduce signal concentration:**
   If you’re using too few operators or very correlated features, your alpha might generate strong but narrow effects. Introduce mild diversification — perhaps a complementary operator capturing sentiment or volatility dynamics.
3. **Check for look-ahead or lag misalignment:**
   Even small timing mismatches (like improper lag application) can cause strong in-sample results but lower fitness when validated across folds.
4. **Blend with a low-correlation structure:**
   Combine your current high-Sharpe logic with a slower or decorrelated component to balance turnover and smooth performance — this often helps fitness recover.

Sometimes fitness improves simply by  **tuning decay horizons**  or adding a  **stabilizing operator**  like  `ts_decay_linear()`  around your signal output.
