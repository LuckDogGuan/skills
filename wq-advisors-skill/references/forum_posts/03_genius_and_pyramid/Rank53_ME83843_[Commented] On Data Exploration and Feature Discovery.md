### *With the vast array of datasets and derived fields available on the BRAIN platform, what’s your process for identifying which data sources are worth experimenting with? Do you rely on intuition about what kind of market behavior a dataset might capture (like sentiment, liquidity, or volatility), or do you systematically explore underused data fields using statistical profiling and correlation analysis?*

*Moreover, when exploring new features, do you focus on building completely novel signals, or do you often try to enhance existing alpha structures by layering additional data dimensions? In your experience, where do you usually find the biggest performance gains — in discovering new datasets or in improving the signal extraction from familiar ones?*

Excellent discussion topic — data exploration truly defines the quality of Alpha design. In my experience, a mixed approach works best: start with an intuitive hypothesis about market behavior (e.g., sentiment → short-term reactions, liquidity → volatility smoothing), then validate it statistically through profiling, correlation heatmaps, and orthogonalization tests. I often find that  **enhancing existing Alphas with new data dimensions**  (like sentiment overlay on a fundamental signal) brings more stable improvement than creating entirely new ones. The key is to balance creativity with statistical discipline.

That’s an excellent and very practical question — one that sits at the core of scalable alpha research. Personally, I use a  **hybrid approach**  when deciding which datasets to explore. Intuition is essential for forming hypotheses — for example, understanding that certain datasets might capture behavioral effects like sentiment or liquidity flow — but I always complement that with  **systematic data profiling** . Examining distribution patterns, correlations, and temporal stability often reveals whether a field truly adds independent information or just repackages what’s already reflected in price or volume.

When experimenting, I usually start by  **enhancing existing alpha frameworks**  with new data layers rather than building from scratch. This allows me to measure marginal contributions clearly and control for turnover, stability, and decorrelation effects. Once I find consistent improvement, I’ll explore extending those insights into  **novel signal structures** .

In my experience, the  **biggest performance gains**  come not from discovering completely new datasets, but from  **extracting deeper structure from well-understood ones**  — refining transformations, time horizons, or cross-sectional interactions. New data can spark breakthroughs, but mastery often lies in squeezing new meaning out of familiar sources.

Ultimately, it’s a cycle: intuition sparks exploration, analysis validates it, and iteration turns insight into robust alpha.

Theoretically, if use the dataset with 0 users and alphas and cook up atom alphas, we might get some new and low production correlation ones. That is another use case I think.

That’s a very thoughtful question! Personally, I start with intuition about the dataset’s market relevance — like how it might reflect sentiment or liquidity — and then validate it statistically. Most of my strongest alphas came from refining familiar datasets with better feature extraction.

That’s a great question, and my process usually begins with an intuition about how a dataset connects to real market behavior—whether it captures sentiment shifts, liquidity pressures, or structural patterns that traders actually respond to. From there, I validate the idea statistically to see if that intuition shows up in the data in a consistent and tradable way. Interestingly, many of my best-performing alphas have come not from exotic datasets but from revisiting familiar ones and applying more thoughtful feature extraction, which often reveals much stronger and more stable signals than expected.

I rely on a mix of intuition and statistical tests. If a dataset captures meaningful behavior like liquidity or sentiment, I explore it deeper. Often, layering new fields onto existing structures gives more stable improvements than raw discovery.
