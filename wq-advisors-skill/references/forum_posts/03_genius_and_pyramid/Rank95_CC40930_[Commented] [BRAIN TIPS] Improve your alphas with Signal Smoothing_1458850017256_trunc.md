**What is smoothing?** Smoothing is a technique used to capture patterns in the data while leaving out noise, or lessen the effects of extreme value data point in your alpha.

**Smoothing on BRAIN platform:** We can apply the idea of Smoothing for the alpha on BRAIN using three simple ways:

**Transformational Operators:**

***Example***  **:**

*tanh(-ts_delta(close,2)*

Idea explanation:

-        This is a simple price-reversion based alpha

-        But with using the  [Hyperbolic tangent function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions)  you can lessen the weights for stocks with extreme price swing between the close price of the two days.

-      There are other transformational operators with the same smoothing effect:  [sigmoid](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/data-and-operators/operators) ,  [arc_tan](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/data-and-operators/detailed-operator-descriptions#44-arc_tanx) , or arithmetic operators:  [log](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/data-and-operators/operators) ,  [s_log_1p](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/data-and-operators/detailed-operator-descriptions#42-s_log_1px)

**Cross Sectional Operators:**

***Example***  **:**

*rank(-ts_delta(close,2))*

Idea explanation:

-        This is the same idea as the above example

-        The rank operator ranks the value of the input data x for the given stock among all instruments, and returns float numbers equally distributed between 0.0 and 1.0, which also distributes the weights uniformly and also lessens the weights of extreme price swing.

-      Other cross sectional operators with the same usage: zscore

**Times-Series Operators:**

***Example***  **:**

*ts_mean(-ts_delta(close, 2), 5)*

Idea explanation:

- This alpha uses the same price-reversion idea with different perspective.
- The ts_mean operator takes the mean of the changes of the close price in two days for every trading week. It will average out the extreme price jump. You can change the lookback window to
- Other time-series operators that can be used the same way: ts_decay_linear, ts_decay_exp_window.

**Tips to do well:**  Also try different operators from the above three categories, experiment with all of them, and get a feel when does each of them perform the best. Smoothing will help the weight less concentrated on few stocks in the universe in a time period.

Excessive smoothening can possibly reduce the performance of your alpha due to reduced average returns. For instance, using a very large value for decay setting can cause this.

Smoothing reduces noise and mitigates extreme values in Alpha signals. On the BRAIN platform, three techniques are available:

1. **Transformational Operators** : Use functions like  `tanh` ,  `sigmoid` , or  `log`  to dampen the effect of extreme values. Example:  `tanh(-ts_delta(close,2))`  reduces extreme price swings.
2. **Cross-Sectional Operators** : Operators like  `rank`  or  `zscore`  normalize values across stocks. Example:  `rank(-ts_delta(close,2))`  distributes weights uniformly, lessening extremes.
3. **Time-Series Operators** : Smooth values over time with operators like  `ts_mean`  or  `ts_decay_linear` . Example:  `ts_mean(-ts_delta(close,2), 5)`  averages changes over a week.

Experiment with these methods to balance weights and enhance Alpha robustness across different scenarios.

What role does smoothing play in mitigating overfitting in alpha strategies? Could you think of a scenario where excessive smoothing might cause the alpha to underperform by failing to capture important signals?

Smoothing is a technique used to filter out noise and reduce the impact of extreme data points, making it easier to identify meaningful patterns in your alpha. On the BRAIN platform, smoothing can be applied through three main operator categories: Transformational, Cross Sectional, and Time-Series Operators.

Hi, has anybody else realised that the transformal operators are now gone?
