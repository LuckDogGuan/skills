## 帖子正文

When applying sigmoid(x) in your alpha pipeline, how do you decide between using it primarily for outlier compression versus treating the output as a probability-like signal for downstream decision-making or thresholding?

Metrics to watch
Metric Expected effect
IC Flat or slightly ↓
Sharpe ↑ or stabilizes
Turnover ↓
Weight concentration ↓

If IC collapses → you compressed before signal was clean.

I choose  `sigmoid(x)`  based on  **pipeline intent** . For  **outlier compression** , I place it  **late**  as a soft cap (often after  `zscore()` / `rank()` ), monitoring Sharpe vs. turnover. For  **probability-like signals** , I carefully normalize inputs (zero-mean, stable scale) and treat outputs as  **confidence weights**  for  **thresholding**  or  **trade_when** . Red flags are sharp IC drops or rising turnover without Sharpe gains—signals that sigmoid is distorting the economic meaning.

Use sigmoid(x) for outlier compression when stabilizing noisy tails before ranking or aggregation. Treat it as probability-like only when inputs are well-calibrated and monotonic with outcome likelihood. In practice, hybrid use works best: compress extremes, then apply thresholds on transformed scores to control turnover, risk, and signal sparsity across regimes.

It depends on the purpose. What is your output? If you want to try the  **binary classifier**  approach (like in the standard logistic regression), then the sigmoid function converts the linear model’s raw score into a  **probability** . This  **probability**  is directly interpreted as the  **likelihood**  that the input x belongs to the positive class, turning the regression output into a calibrated classifier.

I agree it really comes down to intent and placement. I’ve had the best results using sigmoid mainly as a late-stage stabilizer for tails, while reserving probability-like interpretations only when the input is carefully calibrated. Watching for IC collapse versus Sharpe/turnover improvement is a good sanity check that the transformation isn’t washing out the core signal.
