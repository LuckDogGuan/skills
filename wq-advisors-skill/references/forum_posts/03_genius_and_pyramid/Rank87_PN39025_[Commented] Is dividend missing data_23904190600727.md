Hi! Try using ts_backfill(dividend, 120)

[IH10395](/hc/en-us/profiles/21540813213207-IH10395)  - You can use other backfill operators like group_backfill too.

The observation that "Dividend" has only around 5 non-zero values seems unusual, but it depends on the data source, the universe of stocks you're analyzing, and the specific period you're working with. Here are a few potential reasons for this:

### 1.  **Data Sparsity in the Universe**

- If you're using a specific universe of stocks (such as the  `TOP500`  or a subset of the S&P 500), it's possible that only a few stocks within that universe paid dividends during the period you're simulating. Some companies (especially growth stocks in sectors like technology) may not pay dividends, and the dividend payouts from others could be small or infrequent.
- **Example** : Many large-cap tech companies, such as Apple and Amazon, historically didn’t pay dividends, which could result in fewer stocks with non-zero dividend values.

### 2.  **Dividend Frequency**

- Most companies pay dividends on a quarterly or annual basis. However, some companies may not pay dividends for certain periods (e.g., during financial stress or restructuring). It's possible that for the specific period you're looking at (e.g., during a recession or a market crisis), only a few companies paid dividends.
- **Example** : In times of market stress (like 2008 or the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic), many companies suspended or reduced dividends.

### 3.  **Data Source/Quality**

- Depending on your data provider or the specific dataset you’re using, there could be issues with dividend reporting or data sparsity. Sometimes, missing or incomplete data on dividends can result in only a small number of non-zero values being available.
- **Example** : If you're pulling data from a specific exchange or using a third-party data source, it may not include dividend payments for every stock, or the data might be incomplete for some stocks.

### 4.  **Dividend Policy of the Companies in the Universe**

- Certain stocks or sectors have a policy of not paying dividends or paying very irregular dividends. For instance, many growth-oriented companies may reinvest profits into their operations instead of distributing them as dividends. This is especially true for sectors like tech, where companies focus on growth rather than yielding returns to shareholders via dividends.
- **Example** : Companies in the tech, biotech, or growth sectors often do not pay dividends as they prefer to reinvest profits into research and development, acquisitions, or expansion.

### 5.  **Dividend Yield Calculation**

- The way dividends are calculated and reported might also influence the results. If you're using a calculated dividend yield (dividends per share divided by the stock price), the dividend value might be zero or close to zero for companies with no dividends or low-paying dividends. Similarly, stocks with a very high share price but a small dividend might show non-zero dividend values that are relatively small.
- **Example** : A company with a $1 dividend and a $500 share price would have a very low dividend yield, but it still counts as a non-zero dividend.

### 6.  **Data Period**

- If you're using a specific period (e.g., from 2017 to 2022), consider that not all stocks pay dividends in all periods. Some companies may only start paying dividends in specific years, or they might change their dividend policies during the observed period.
- **Example** : If the period under consideration includes a crisis (like the 2020 pandemic), many companies that typically paid dividends might have suspended or reduced payouts during that time.

### Steps to Validate:

1. **Check the Dividend History** : Look at the dividend history of the companies in your universe. Are the companies you're analyzing generally dividend-paying, or are they known for not paying dividends?
2. **Verify the Data Source** : Double-check your data source for completeness. Make sure you're not missing dividend data due to issues like delisting, data gaps, or incorrect reporting.
3. **Expand the Universe** : If you’re using a small universe (e.g.,  `TOP500` ), consider expanding the universe to include more stocks. A broader universe is more likely to include companies that pay dividends.
4. **Look at Different Time Periods** : Check if the dividend values are consistent across different periods. Are the dividends missing from all years, or just specific periods?

### Conclusion:

It's not necessarily wrong that there are only five non-zero dividend values, but it does suggest that the universe you're working with (especially if you're using large-cap stocks or a specific sector) may not have many dividend-paying stocks, or that the period under consideration was one where dividend payments were sparse. If you want to analyze dividends more comprehensively, you might need to adjust your universe or time period to include a broader range of dividend-paying stocks.

Let me know if you'd like further assistance in troubleshooting or exploring this further!

**Hey!  [DK20528](/hc/en-us/profiles/24602396283031-DK20528)  really gave a thorough analysis there. I agree with those points. Another thing you could do is cross-check with other reliable data sources to confirm if it's a common pattern. Also, when looking at the dividend history, pay attention to any patterns in dividend changes over time for those few stocks with non-zero values. That might give you more clues on whether it's just a quirk of the current setup or something more systemic. Hope this helps a bit more!**

The universe of stocks you're analyzing might be composed of companies that don't typically pay dividends. Many companies, especially those in sectors like technology, are known for reinvesting their profits into growth rather than paying dividends to shareholders. This is particularly true for growth stocks that prioritize expansion and innovation over shareholder payouts.

Hi ,That’s correct! You should apply neutralization settings and consider adjusting them. Alternatively, wrapping with a group operation can enhance performance and lead to improvements.

Yes, that's accurate! You may want to adjust your neutralization settings and explore tweaking them further. Additionally, incorporating a group operation can improve performance and lead to better results.

### Adjusting Neutralization Settings:

1. **Sector/Industry Neutralization** :
   - Neutralize by  **sector**  or  **industry group**  to reduce biases arising from broad trends within specific groups.
   - For example, use operators like  `group_neutralize`  with GICS sectors or similar classifications.
2. **Factor Risk Neutralization** :
   - Neutralize against common risk factors like  **market beta** ,  **size** , or  **volatility** . This ensures the strategy focuses purely on stock-specific negative momentum.
3. **Dynamic Neutralization** :
   - Adjust neutralization weights dynamically based on market conditions. For instance:
   - Increase neutralization strength during high-correlation environments.
   - Decrease it during periods of low market correlation to emphasize stock-level alpha.

### Leveraging Group Operations:

1. **Group Aggregation** :
   - Use  **`group_rank`**  or  **`group_zscore`**  to rank or normalize stocks within specific groups (e.g., industries or regions).
   - This ensures the ranking reflects  **relative performance within groups** , avoiding unintended overweighting of specific segments.
2. **Group-Based Signal Refinement** :
   - Apply  **group statistics** , such as the  **mean or median**  of  `ts_delta(close, 5)`  within a group, to refine the ranking. For instance:
   - Subtract the group mean from individual stock scores to highlight deviations from group trends.
3. **Combine with Neutralization** :
   - Pair group operations with neutralization to maintain balance while emphasizing performance differences at the stock level.

- - Ranks stocks based on their 5-period price changes.
  - Applies neutralization at the sector level, ensuring the ranking is not skewed by sector-wide momentum.

### Testing and Optimization:

1. **Backtesting** :
   - Test the strategy with and without neutralization to assess its impact on Sharpe ratio, turnover, and alpha decay.
2. **Exploration** :
   - Experiment with different  **grouping variables**  (e.g., market cap, region) to find the most effective configuration.
3. **Robustness Checks** :
   - Use out-of-sample data to confirm that the adjusted strategy generalizes well across different market conditions.
