Instead of using the groups available in worldquant settings, creating your custom groups cam be vital to improve your alpha perfomance and reduce correlation. This cam be achieved using the bucket operator.

for instance , custom=bucket(rank(cap),range="0,1,0.1") this creates ten buckets as we have a range on 0 to 1 with a gap of 0.1 , you can increase the number of buckets by increasing of decreasing the gap.

Thanks for your very helpful sharing. I personally often use the custom neutralization method above and have occasionally seen improvements in Alpha performance. In addition to that technique, double neutralization is also quite effective and worth exploring:

Nice insight! Custom neutralization using bucketed groups is a powerful way to reduce correlation and tailor your alpha exposure. It adds flexibility beyond predefined groups and can definitely help fine-tune performance. Great example with the  **bucket**  operator!

Great thread! Custom neutralization via  `bucket(rank(cap), range="0,1,0.1")`  gives a lot more control compared to default groups, especially when you're targeting specific factor exposures. I’ve seen some gains by aligning bucket granularity with signal volatility too

You're making a solid point.Creating custom groups instead of using predefined groupings in WorldQuant settings can significantly enhance alpha performance and reduce signal correlation. By defining tailored group structures, you gain more control over how data is segmented, allowing for finer differentiation across stocks. This helps capture more specific market behavior and leads to more precise signal adjustments. Custom grouping also allows for better neutralization and improved robustness, especially when standard groups are too broad or not aligned with the alpha's logic. Ultimately, this approach can lead to stronger, less correlated signals with improved risk control and greater overall alpha effectiveness.

Custom buckets with  `bucket()`  give way more control than default groups—smart technique for reducing correlation and boosting alpha robustness.

Using custom buckets for neutralization is a clever way to fine-tune grouping, cut down correlation, and squeeze more performance from your alphas.
