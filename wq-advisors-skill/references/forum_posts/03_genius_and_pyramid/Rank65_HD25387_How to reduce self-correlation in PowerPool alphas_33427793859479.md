Hi everyone, I’m trying to improve my OS performance and noticed that many of my PowerPool alphas have high self-correlation. What’s the best way to reduce this? Should I focus more on group-neutralization or diversify fields/operators?

Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks!

I think you should focus on diversifying the datasets to be more effective and reduce the corr better, or your ideas should be diverse, increasing the number of operators used will help reduce the corr.

I would to say use orthogonal operators, time lag differentiation, combine with risk adjustments, weight averaging, monitor in Genius that's its...

I suggest that you diversify you ideas on alpha creation so as to reduce self correlation.You can go to the learn section and get to know the operations of other operators.Thank you

You need to diversify you alphas using different datafields, datasets, operators and days as well while creating alphas. When you create diverse(non-similar) alpha from your previous submitted alphas then your self-correlation will go down automatically.

I think this is the way to go about it ;

1.Diversify  your Signals: Use different fields (e.g., sentiment, options, alternative data) and avoid overlapping factors.

2. Change Operators: Mix up time-series operators (e.g., ts_rank, ts_zscore) and cross-sectional ones (e.g., rank, group_zscore).

3. Adjust Lookbacks: Vary lookback windows to avoid similar signal timing.

4. Use Group-Neutralization Smartly: Don’t overuse — apply it only where it adds value (e.g., to remove strong industry/sector bias).

High self-correlation in PowerPool alphas can reduce overall performance, so it’s wise to address it. One effective way is to diversify the types of fields and operators you use avoid repeating similar structures across alphas. Group neutralization can also help, especially if your alphas are heavily exposed to specific sectors or styles. Additionally, consider using orthogonalization techniques or PCA to reduce overlap. Testing in smaller PowerPools before full deployment can also highlight redundancy early. Keep tracking correlations across different market regimes too, as patterns can shift. Hope this helps looking forward to hearing what works for you.

To reduce high self-correlation in your PowerPool alphas, focus on diversifying both datasets and logic structure.
Use a broader range of operators, signals, and time horizons to create distinct alpha behaviors.
Group-neutralization helps, but true reduction comes from unique idea generation.
Explore the Learn section to understand underused operators and field combinations.

Reducing self-correlation in PowerPool alphas is essential for improving OS performance. One effective approach is to diversify your data fields—move beyond commonly used analyst and valuation inputs, and explore alternative datasets like risk factors, sentiment scores, or macro indicators. Alongside this, varying your operator choices can help; try experimenting with different lags, window sizes, or nonlinear transformations like  `log_diff` ,  `pasteurize` , or  `sign`  to introduce signal diversity.

To lower self-correlation in your PowerPool, diversify both datasets and logic structures by using a wider mix of operators, signals, and time horizons. While group-neutralization helps, the real impact comes from generating genuinely distinct ideas. Exploring the Learn section for underused operators and creative field combinations is a practical way to spark unique alpha behaviors.

High self-correlation in PowerPool alphas usually signals that your signals are capturing very similar structures, which can hurt OS stability. A good first step is to review whether your components are overly reliant on the same base fields or common operators like rank and decay, since this often creates redundancy. Group-neutralization is helpful, especially at the industry or country level, but it usually doesn’t solve correlation by itself if the underlying construction is too similar. Diversifying across datasets, mixing short- and long-horizon operators, or even blending nonlinear transformations like signed\_power with standard ranking can make a bigger difference. You can also try residualizing new alphas against existing ones to force orthogonality and test if they still add value. In practice, the most effective approach combines both: apply neutralization to control biases while intentionally designing alphas that rely on different drivers, which tends to reduce self-correlation and improve OS robustness. Do you want me to show you a compact workflow you can follow to test and prune high-correlation alphas in your pool?
