## 帖子正文

In the Brain platform, there are three types of data fields:

- Matrix
- Group
- Vector

While matrix and group data fields can be used directly, the vector data field requires an extra step. A vector data field holds one or more values for a single instrument within a day, so it needs to be converted to a matrix using specific operators before it can be used in alpha generation.

Operators for Vector Data Fields
The platform offers various operators to transform vector data fields into a matrix format, including:

vec_avg , vec_choose, vec_count, vec_ir, vec_kurtosis, vec_max, vec_min, vec_norm,  vec_percentage, vec_powersum, vec_range, vec_skewness, vec_stddev, vec_sum

If you’re new to vector data fields, start with the vec_avg operator, which simply provides the mean of the vector field.

For further details, explore the  [Learn](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/advanced-topics/vector-datafields)  section on the Brain platform.

Happy Learning!

I generally use these operators and sometimes these are beneficial to improve correlation and all, but sometimes i am unable yo use vec_choose operator in some data fields.

please guide me about this.

thank you

Hi  [SC87308](/hc/en-us/profiles/16143039569687-SC87308)

I would say it solely depends on the nature of the data. The description of the vec_choose operator is choosing the k-th item (indexed at 0) from each vector field x. There might be instances where there is no value in the vector at the specific index. In such cases, it would be better to use some aggregation operators, like vec_sum or vec_avg.

Can you please give more context and maybe example of datafield?

It might also be helpful to check out the Learn section article:  [Vector Datafields](https://platform.worldquantbrain.com/learn/documentation/advanced-topics/vector-datafields)  and  [[BRAIN TIPS] How to use vector operators and vector data fields]([Commented] [BRAIN TIPS] How to use vector operators and vector data fields_14902471049239.md)

Great breakdown of vector data fields! Starting with vec_avg is a smart tip for beginners. The operator list is super helpful. Thanks for sharing!

Thanks for your post. Could you share some alpha ideas using operators vec_skewness and vec_kurtosis? I haven't made any alpha using these operators yet.

### 评论 #5 (作者: TT55495, 时间: 1年前)

I would like to ask if using vec_ operators to nest into vector data is considered using 1 op for that alpha. Since this is mandatory, I think we should not count +1 op for vec_ operators.

[TN48752](/hc/en-us/profiles/13714359745431-TN48752)  vec_skewness, and vec_kurtosis could be used to measure the difference or distribution of opinion in news data or analyst data. I use them often when count > 5 for most stocks. It can also be used in a synonymous manner to vec_stddev! Often using time series operators with vec_skewness, and kurtosis inside trade_when also helps in finding new signals for data fields I have already used.

### 评论 #7 (作者: ND68030, 时间: 1年前)

I would like to ask if there is any operator other than vec_ that can be applied directly to vector data? Or is it necessary to use vec_ first to reduce the data dimension to a matrix?

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for your generous sharing. Your willingness to offer your time, knowledge, and resources means a great deal to me. The insights you've provided have not only broadened my understanding but also inspired me to take positive steps forward. It's rare to encounter someone so selfless and giving, and I truly appreciate the impact you've had. Thank you for your kindness and for being such a valuable source of support. Your gesture will be remembered, and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn from you.

The article provided a valuable explanation of the three data field types on the Brain platform: Matrix, Group, and Vector. While Matrix and Group data fields can be directly used in alpha generation, the Vector data field requires conversion into a matrix format through specific operators.

Vector data fields hold multiple values for a single instrument within a day, which can be transformed using operators like  `vec_avg` ,  `vec_choose` ,  `vec_count` , and others. These operators allow users to derive statistics such as the mean ( `vec_avg` ), count ( `vec_count` ), or maximum value ( `vec_max` ) from a vector, converting it into a more usable matrix form for alpha generation.

For beginners, starting with simple operators like  `vec_avg`  is recommended, as it provides a basic and easy-to-understand transformation. The article also points out the availability of additional operators like  `vec_skewness`  or  `vec_sum`  for more advanced analyses.

This breakdown of vector data fields and conversion tools emphasizes the flexibility of the Brain platform, empowering users to leverage a wide range of data transformations for alpha strategy development.

Great overview of vector data fields and how they work in the Brain platform! Transforming vector data into a matrix using operators like  `vec_avg`  is a great starting point, as it simplifies the data for use in alpha generation. As you get more familiar with the platform, exploring other operators like  `vec_skewness`  or  `vec_stddev`  can offer deeper insights into the data's distribution and variability. This flexibility in handling vector data is essential for building more advanced strategies. Happy learning indeed!

The Brain Team has launched a new operator for vector data: vec_filter. The vec_filter operator is a powerful tool designed for efficient preprocessing of vector data. It allows you to filter out unwanted values, such as  `nan` ,  `0` , or any other specified values, in a simple and effective way. For instance, you can filter multiple values at once using a command like vec_filter `(vec, value="nan 0 10")` . This makes it ideal for cleaning datasets before further analysis or modeling. I have used it to preprocess data and saw a significant improvement in my IS performance. You should try it!

I completely agree with your viewpoint. The vec_ operators should not be counted as +1 in Genius. This would be fair and encourage Consultants to use Vector-type operators more.

I often have to use the vec_ operator when dealing with data like News, Earnings, and Insiders.
But compared to Matrix, the number of Alpha submissions I've made using Vector is much lower. To diversify my Alphas, I'm also trying to improve this issue.

To optimize the use of vector data, selecting the right operator is crucial, depending on the goal, such as averaging (vec_avg), skewness (vec_skewness), or dispersion (vec_stddev). Additionally, combining vector data with other data types or verifying reliability after conversion can enhance the effectiveness of trading strategies

One interesting approach is using vec_ir (information ratio) to evaluate the consistency of signals extracted from vector data. It helps measure how well a vector-based signal performs relative to its risk. Also, combining vec_skewness with event-driven data like earnings surprises could uncover asymmetries in market reactions. Has anyone experimented with these in alpha strategies?

Understanding how operations like vec_avg, vec_max, and vec_stddev may convert vector data into a matrix representation for more effective analysis is particularly beneficial. For those who are unfamiliar with vector data, starting with vec_avg to obtain a basic mean is an excellent advice. This greatly facilitates the application of advanced quantitative approaches and enhances model performance. Thank you for the insight!
