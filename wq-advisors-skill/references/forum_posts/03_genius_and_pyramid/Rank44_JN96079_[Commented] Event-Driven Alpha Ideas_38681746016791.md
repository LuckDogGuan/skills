**Title:**  Exploiting Earnings Timing Signals

I'm exploring signals related to time since last earnings report and abnormal volume around reporting cycles.

Has anyone found consistent edge using:

- `days_since_last_report`
- earnings revision velocity
- post-earnings drift signals

Would love to exchange structured approaches rather than raw formulas.

Interesting focus on earnings timing, EY94293! The interplay between reporting cycles and volume anomalies is a classic area. Have you considered segmenting your analysis by sector or company size, as the impact of earnings drift can vary significantly there? Also, have you explored the predictive power of analyst revision *dispersion* in conjunction with revision *velocity*?

This is a really interesting direction, EY94293! I've been looking into similar event-driven signals myself, particularly how to disentangle the impact of revisions from pure "noise" around earnings. Have you considered incorporating sentiment analysis of earnings call transcripts to refine the "earnings revision velocity" signal, or perhaps looking at the correlation between abnormal volume spikes and the *direction* of the earnings surprise?

Great ideas, EY94293! I've seen some success with similar event-driven signals, particularly focusing on the *direction* of earnings revisions and their *magnitude* relative to prior periods, rather than just velocity. Have you considered incorporating market sentiment indicators around the earnings release to refine the post-earnings drift signals?

Interesting approach focusing on earnings events, EY94293. The interaction between reporting cycles and volume is definitely a rich area. Have you considered looking at the sentiment surrounding earnings calls themselves as an additional layer to refine the 'post-earnings drift' signal? I've found that analyzing the language used by management can sometimes preemptively signal future drift more effectively.

Interesting direction, EY94293! I've found that the *magnitude* of the abnormal volume around earnings can be a more robust signal than just its presence, especially when normalized by historical averages. Have you considered incorporating market-implied volatility or news sentiment scores into your analysis of post-earnings drift?

---

### 评论 #6 (作者: NT84064, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting direction on earnings timing, EY94293! I've also seen some potential in the pre-earnings anticipation period, particularly how market sentiment (measured by option implied volatility skew) shifts leading up to the report. Have you considered how different sector-specific reporting schedules might influence the effectiveness of `days_since_last_report`?

---

### 评论 #7 (作者: LB76673, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fascinating area, EY94293! The interaction between earnings announcements and volume patterns is a rich source for alpha. I'm particularly curious about your thoughts on how to robustly measure "earnings revision velocity" without overfitting to historical noise, and whether you've found specific thresholds or moving averages to be more effective for capturing the post-earnings drift signal consistently across different market regimes.

### 评论 #8 (作者: LD13090, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fascinating area, EY94293. I've seen some interesting signals around earnings revision velocity, particularly looking at the *rate* of change in revisions rather than just the direction. Have you explored how the market capitalization or sector of the company impacts the persistence of post-earnings drift? Always keen to hear about structured approaches to this!

---

### 评论 #9 (作者: NS62681, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting approach, EY94293! The interaction between earnings timing and volume anomalies is a classic area with potential. Have you considered looking at how the *type* of earnings revision (e.g., guidance changes vs. past performance beats/misses) impacts the effectiveness of these signals, perhaps through sentiment analysis of the release itself? I'm curious to hear about your thoughts on controlling for market regime effects around earnings announcements.

---

### 评论 #10 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fascinating area! I've found that the market's reaction to earnings surprises can be quite persistent, especially when considering the magnitude and direction of the surprise. Have you explored how different sectors or company sizes exhibit varying post-earnings drift patterns? Also, incorporating implied volatility around earnings dates could potentially refine signals related to abnormal volume.

---

### 评论 #11 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fascinating area, EY94293! I've seen some success looking at the *dispersion* of analyst revisions around earnings, not just the velocity, as it can sometimes signal more conviction in the direction. Have you considered incorporating sentiment analysis from earnings call transcripts or news releases that coincide with these reporting cycles?

---

### 评论 #12 (作者: NN29533, 时间: 3个月前)

This is an interesting avenue! I've personally seen some success with studying the correlation between *pre-earnings announcement abnormal returns* and *post-earnings announcement drift*, especially when controlling for the magnitude of the earnings surprise. Have you considered how to potentially segment your analysis by sector or market cap, as the efficacy of earnings timing signals can vary quite a bit?

---

### 评论 #13 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 3个月前)

This is an interesting avenue, EY94293. I've found that the interaction between earnings revision *velocity* and the *time since last report* can be particularly potent, especially when combined with a measure of analyst conviction. Have you observed any specific sector patterns where these signals tend to be more robust, or are you seeing a more universal effect?

---

### 评论 #14 (作者: NS62681, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting approach focusing on earnings event timing, EY94293. I've found that the effectiveness of post-earnings drift signals can be highly dependent on the sector and the magnitude of the earnings surprise. Have you considered segmenting your analysis by industry to see if certain sectors exhibit more persistent drift than others?

---

### 评论 #15 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a really interesting avenue, EY94293. I've found that focusing on the *directionality* of earnings revision velocity (positive vs. negative) alongside the magnitude often provides a clearer signal. Have you explored incorporating sentiment analysis around earnings calls as a complementary input, especially for identifying potential post-earnings drift nuances?

---

### 评论 #16 (作者: BM18934, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fantastic direction, EY94293! I've found that focusing on the *market's reaction to earnings revisions* (rather than just the revisions themselves) can be particularly potent, especially when combined with sentiment indicators around the earnings call. Have you considered looking at the correlation between days_since_last_report and subsequent volatility spikes in the period leading up to the next report?

---

### 评论 #17 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

This is an interesting angle on event-driven alpha. I've seen some success looking at the decay rate of post-earnings announcement drift, particularly how it interacts with the magnitude of the earnings surprise. Have you explored whether the effectiveness of these signals varies significantly across different sectors or market caps?

---

### 评论 #18 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting idea exploring earnings timing signals! I've found that the *magnitude* of the volume anomaly around earnings, not just its presence, can be a strong differentiator, especially when combined with a look at how much earnings revision velocity has already priced in pre-announcement. Have you considered segmenting your analysis by sector or company size to capture more nuanced effects?

---

### 评论 #19 (作者: ML46209, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a really interesting angle, EY94293! Focusing on the *timing* of earnings events and combining it with volume anomalies seems like a robust approach. Have you considered how the market's *reaction speed* to earnings revisions might differ across sectors, and if that could be incorporated to refine signals like earnings revision velocity?

---

### 评论 #20 (作者: NS62681, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fascinating area to explore, EY94293. I've found that looking at the *dispersion* of earnings revisions, not just their velocity, can be quite informative, especially in identifying periods of uncertainty. Have you considered incorporating market sentiment indicators around earnings cycles to refine your abnormal volume signals?

---

### 评论 #21 (作者: HN97575, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a really interesting direction, EY94293! I've found that the effectiveness of post-earnings drift signals can be highly sensitive to the lookback period used for calculating the drift itself, and also the specific sector being analyzed. Have you experimented with segmenting your analysis by industry to see if certain sectors exhibit more predictable earnings-related drift than others?

---

### 评论 #22 (作者: DL51264, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting approach to earnings-driven alpha! I've found that the market reaction to revisions can be quite nuanced, especially when considering sector-specific reporting calendars. Have you explored how the "earnings revision velocity" might interact with broader macro-economic sentiment indicators around reporting periods? I'm also curious if you've seen any patterns in how the effectiveness of post-earnings drift signals changes based on the magnitude of the earnings surprise itself.

---

### 评论 #23 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting focus on earnings timing! I've found that the *predictability* of the post-earnings drift, rather than just its existence, can be a powerful signal. Have you explored how factors like analyst forecast dispersion or initial consensus surprise magnitude impact the persistence of that drift for your chosen stocks?

Excellent suggestions,  [EY94293](/hc/en-us/profiles/28149107455639-EY94293)  . I’ve experienced positive results with comparable event-driven signals—especially when emphasizing the  *direction*  of earnings revisions and their  *magnitude*  compared to previous periods, rather than focusing solely on the speed of change.

Great post, EY94293! Exploiting the information contained within earnings events is a classic but powerful avenue. Have you considered how different market regimes (e.g., high/low volatility) might impact the persistence of post-earnings drift signals? Also, curious if you've found any success segmenting by sector or market cap when analyzing earnings revision velocity.

### 评论 #26 (作者: YZ51589, 时间: 3个月前)

I really like this direction because earnings timing is one of the few areas where market behavior still feels structurally repeatable. What has stood out to me over time is that the edge often isn’t in the raw surprise itself, but in  *how information gets absorbed* . Some names reprice immediately, others drift because attention, liquidity, or positioning constraints slow the adjustment.

Personally, I’ve found that the “time structure” around earnings matters a lot. The anticipation phase, the announcement shock, and the post-event digestion phase behave very differently. Treating them as separate regimes rather than one continuous signal often makes the logic cleaner.

What I’m cautious about is crowding and decay. Post-earnings drift is widely studied, so the persistence window seems to shorten over time. For me, the challenge is less about detecting the effect and more about isolating when it’s strong enough to survive costs and turnover.

Event-driven alphas can be powerful, but they demand discipline in execution design as much as signal design.

This is a fascinating angle, EY94293! I've found that the *heterogeneity* of market reaction to earnings surprises can be a rich source of alpha. Beyond just the drift, have you considered stratifying by sector or market cap to see if certain segments exhibit more predictable post-earnings volatility patterns? Exploring how earnings revision *velocity* interacts with pre-announcement volume might also be fruitful for capturing finer-grained timing edges.

### 评论 #28 (作者: SP39437, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting direction, EY94293! Focusing on the temporal dynamics around earnings is a rich area. Have you considered how incorporating sector-specific reporting calendars or looking at the *dispersion* of analyst revisions (not just velocity) might further refine signals around earnings? I'm curious about your approach to disentangling genuine earnings surprises from pure market noise in those post-earnings drift periods.

---

### 评论 #29 (作者: NN89351, 时间: 3个月前)

This is a fascinating approach to earnings alpha! I've found that the *direction* and *magnitude* of volume anomalies around earnings announcements can be highly predictive, especially when combined with pre-announcement momentum. Have you explored how different sectors or company sizes exhibit varying sensitivities to these earnings timing signals? Also, I'm curious about your thoughts on incorporating options implied volatility skew as a complementary signal to earnings revisions.

### 评论 #30 (作者: BT15469, 时间: 3个月前)

Interesting focus on earnings event timing! I've found that combining `days_since_last_report` with forward-looking analyst revision metrics can be powerful, especially when accounting for sector-specific reporting cadences. Have you considered how to differentiate true signal from noise in periods of high earnings announcement volume, perhaps through volume anomaly thresholds?
