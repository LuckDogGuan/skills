I have a question: Will the Genius Program rank participants after applying filters such as pyramid count, signal count, and combined Sharpe ratio, or will it rank participants based on the entire pool of consultants?

Additionally, I noticed that some operators count as more than one per alpha (e.g., inst_pnl counts as 2 operators). Could the WQ team please look into this?

When the number of people exceeds the available seats at a given level, a tie-break will occur where all criteria are assessed equally. If you do not succeed in the tie-break, you will be evaluated at the next lower level, continuing this process until you secure a spot. Good luck!

The problem with inst_pnl calculating two operators is because you made a mistake. I calculated only one operator. You can submit each operator separately for verification.

That's a great question! Regarding the Genius Program ranking, typically, rankings are based on specific performance metrics, such as pyramid count, signal count, and combined Sharpe ratio, with each participant's performance evaluated based on their individual pool of alphas. However, I suggest confirming this directly with the WQ team, as rules may vary or be updated.

As for the operator count, if some operators like  `inst_pnl`  are counted as more than one per alpha, this could indeed affect the overall ranking. It would be helpful to reach out to the WQ team to clarify whether this is an intentional adjustment in how operators are counted or if it's an oversight that should be corrected.

Hope this helps!

Hi  [TL60820](/hc/en-us/profiles/13171997597975-TL60820) ,

I suspect that since inst_pnl() also uses price-volume data, as stated in its description, it might use another operator behind the scenes too. In my case inst_tvr() gave me 2 operators instead of 1. But as  [顾问 CC40930 (Rank 95)](/hc/en-us/profiles/17789930292503-顾问 CC40930 (Rank 95))  has stated, WQ support should help clarify things much better. Cheers!

The Genius Program likely applies filters like pyramid count, signal count, and combined Sharpe ratio to rank eligible participants rather than using the entire consultant pool. This approach ensures rankings reflect active and consistent contributors. Regarding operators counting as more than one (e.g.,  `inst_pnl`  counting as two), it may involve internal dependencies or complexities in calculation. It’s worth confirming this behavior with the WQ support team for clarity and potential adjustments.

Hey, I found your question about the ranking in the Genius Program really interesting! It's great that you're diving into these specifics. As a quantitative trading enthusiast, I understand the significance of metrics like Sharpe ratio and operator counts in performance evaluation. It does seem crucial for rankings to take those filters into account to reflect true performance levels among participants. I'm curious how the inst_pnl operator affects overall rankings since any discrepancies there can skew results. Have you thought about how these metrics might impact your own strategies? Good luck with your trading endeavors, and maybe we can exchange insights on optimizing alpha strategies!

- - **Manage Risk** : Tighten risk controls to avoid unnecessary losses that can eat into your profits.
  - **Position Sizing** : Ensure that the sizes of positions are optimal. Large positions may result in more slippage, while small positions may not fully capitalize on the strategy's potential.

**Select a Model** : Based on the features, choose a machine learning model to identify patterns and predict returns or price movement. Popular models include:

- **Linear Models** : Like linear regression for predicting future stock returns based on the features.
- **Tree-based Models** : Random forests or gradient boosting can handle non-linear relationships and are good for feature importance analysis.

The Genius Program typically ranks participants based on multiple metrics including pyramid count, signal count, and combined Sharpe ratio, applied to the filtered pool of qualified consultants. Regarding operator counting, some complex operators like inst_pnl do count as multiple operators due to their computational complexity. Contact WQ support for specific details.

The Genius Program likely uses filters like pyramid count, signal count, and Sharpe ratio to rank eligible participants, ensuring rankings reflect active contributors. Operators counting more than once (e.g., inst_pnl as two) might be due to calculation complexities. It’s best to confirm with the WQ support team for clarity and potential adjustments.

The Genius Program likely ranks participants using filters like pyramid count, signal count, and Sharpe ratio, focusing on active contributors. Operators counting multiple times (e.g., inst_pnl as two) may involve calculation complexities. It's a good idea to check with WQ support for confirmation and adjustments.

It's great that you're seeking clarification on the ranking criteria! Understanding how filters like pyramid count and signal count affect rankings is crucial. Distinguishing between individual and combined contributions is a key detail, especially when certain operators count as multiple. Hopefully, the team can provide insights on this for a clearer perspective.

That's a great question! It would be helpful to know whether the ranking is based on the entire consultant pool or only after applying specific filters like pyramid count, signal count, and combined Sharpe ratio. Clarification on this could provide better insights into performance evaluation.

Also, I’ve noticed that some operators, like inst_pnl, count as more than one per alpha. It would be great if the WQ team could confirm whether this is intentional or if adjustments might be considered. Looking forward to their response!

Your questions about the tie-breaker ranking in the Genius Program highlight some important nuances in how participants are evaluated. It’s interesting to consider how performance metrics like pyramid count and Sharpe ratio play into the rankings. If rankings are based on individual performance metrics, how do you think this impacts collaboration among participants? Encouraging a competitive yet supportive environment could enhance overall alpha quality.
