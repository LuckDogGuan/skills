**Paper:** The Stock Market Valuation of Research and Development Expenditures

**Authors:** Louis K. C. Chan, Josef Lakonishok and Theodore Sougiannis

**Link:**   [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=227564](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=227564)

The majority of a firm’s assets, such as inventories or equipment, are physical, and their value can be easily recorded into the books. On the other hand, the firm also owns assets like workforce skill or production methods that are less tangible and have uncertain value. One of the aptest examples of such intangible assets are expenditures on Research & Development.
One of the research papers investigating whether the market appropriately accounts for firms’ expenditures on R&D has been conducted by Chan et al. (1999). In this research, the authors have found that two similar firms, one with significant R&D expenditures and the other with absent R&D, might appear to be equally expensive when considering traditional measures such as price-to-earnings or price-to-book ratios. However, the  [market tends to underestimate the future opportunities associated with the first firm’s R&D spending](https://quantpedia.com/an-investigation-of-rd-risk-premium-strategies/)  relative to the growth opportunities of the second. Simply relating the amount of the past 5 years’ R&D expenditures to the firm’s market equity value, the researchers show that stocks of firms with a high amount of R&D expenditures relative to their Market cap earn greater average returns in the future.

Under the efficient market hypothesis, the investor should be able to recognize the value of less-tangible assets. However, in conditions of an inefficient market, the presence of such intangible assets could possibly lead to mispricing. One of the reasons for possible mispricing lies in the US GAAP and IFRS accounting standards. Under these standards, the costs of R&D must be expensed in the same fiscal year as they occur and therefore could significantly influence the reported earnings of a company in the current year. However, the R&D expenditures usually represent a long-term investment that implies a possible future revenue and cash flow.

**Idea:**

For each stock in the universe, calculate a measure of total R&D expenditures in the past 5 years scaled by the firm’s Market cap (defined on page 7, eq. 1). Go long (short) on the quintile of firms with the highest (lowest) R&D expenditures relative to their Market Cap. Weight the portfolio equally and rebalance next year.

**Data:**

market cap

Hi!

Thanks a lot for sharing your idea. I have a question - have you considered the industry-specific nature of R&D expenditures? Certain industries, like technology and pharmaceuticals, tend to have high R&D expenditures, while others may not. How would you account for this variation in your strategy?

Hi,

Thank you for sharing your idea!

Can I interpret the idea in the following way?

Firstly, For each stock in the universe, calculate a measure of total R&D expenditures in the past 5 years scaled by the firm’s Market cap (defined on page 7, eq. 1). Can we look at it as rd_expense/cap, with the 5-year time horizon (252*5)?

Secondly, Go long (short) on the quintile of firms with the highest (lowest) R&D expenditures relative to their Market Cap. Does this mean we could use quantile-related operator (such as quantile, ts_quantile, group_quantile)? Since quantile operator calculate the respective quantile of a stock on a given day, they may produce a positive number in [0;1] range. This may means a all-long stock portfolio. Therefore, maybe we should apply some further neutralization methods to also have short position.

Thirdly, Weight the portfolio equally and rebalance next year. Does this mean we start the process all over in the start of the new year, which could potentially signify a 252-day time horizon in time series operator?

Hope to hear from your comments.

Thank you.

Have a great day.

Best regards!

Hey, this idea's quite interesting, folks. Basically, it's about using the ratio of past 5 years' R&D expenditures to market cap as a factor. By going long on stocks with the highest ratio and short on those with the lowest, we're trying to capture the potential mispricing caused by how R&D is accounted for. When rebalancing annually, we aim to adapt to changes. Just make sure the data for "rd_expense" and "market cap" is accurate for reliable results.

Thanks a lot for sharing your idea,

1. **R&D Expenditures Relative to Market Cap (rd_expense/cap)** :
   - Yes, you're correct. For each stock in the universe, you would calculate the ratio of total R&D expenditures over the past 5 years to the firm's market cap. The time horizon you're considering (252 * 5 trading days) seems appropriate for capturing the past 5 years of R&D expenditures in a time-series context. This ratio,  **rd_expense/cap** , would give you a measure of how R&D-intensive a company is relative to its size.
2. **Long/Short Based on Quintile of R&D Expenditures** :
   - Exactly! You can use quantile-related operators (like  **quantile** ,  **ts_quantile** , or  **group_quantile** ) to segment the stocks into quintiles based on their R&D expenditures relative to market cap.
   - **Quantile operators**  will group stocks into quintiles based on their rankings, and since the output is between 0 and 1, you’re correct in pointing out that this may produce a long-only portfolio if you simply pick the highest quintile (e.g., the 80%-100% quantile).
   - To ensure that your portfolio has both long and short positions, you could neutralize this by applying further methods, such as:
   - **Long the top quintile (highest)** : Buy stocks with the highest R&D/market cap ratio.
   - **Short the bottom quintile (lowest)** : Sell stocks with the lowest R&D/market cap ratio.
   - This ensures you have exposure on both sides of the market.
3. **Equal Portfolio Weighting and Annual Rebalancing** :
   - Yes, you're right again! The idea is to start the process at the beginning of the year, calculate the R&D/market cap ratios, and rank the stocks into quintiles based on the most recent data. This would correspond to the 252 trading days in the time-series window you mentioned.
   - At the beginning of each new year (or rebalance period), you would:
   - Recalculate the R&D/market cap ratios for all stocks.
   - Rank them again and split them into quintiles.
   - Construct the portfolio with long positions in the highest quintile and short positions in the lowest quintile.
   - Rebalance the portfolio equally across the stocks within the selected quantiles, adjusting the weights each time.

This annual rebalancing and equal weighting will ensure your portfolio remains relatively balanced, and the periodic updates will allow it to capture new information and trends in the market.

Overall, the structure you’ve outlined is very solid, and applying neutralization techniques and periodic rebalancing will help maintain a robust and adaptable portfolio.

**Yeah, you all made really good points. Regarding industry variation, we could consider adding an industry-neutralization step. Like group stocks by industry first, then calculate the R&D/cap ratio within each group to make the factor more comparable across different industries. And for the quantile part, your thoughts on using neutralization methods to get both long and short positions are spot on. Annual rebalancing indeed helps keep the portfolio updated with fresh market info. Keep discussing, guys!**

**Industry-Specific Nature of R&D Expenditures** : It's important to consider the industry-specific nature of R&D spending when implementing this alpha idea. Industries like technology and pharmaceuticals typically have higher R&D expenditures, which should be accounted for to avoid industry bias.
 **Quantile-Based Portfolio Construction** : Using quantile-related operators to segment stocks into quintiles based on their R&D expenditures relative to market cap is a suggested approach. To ensure a balanced portfolio with both long and short positions, neutralization methods can be applied.
 **Annual Rebalancing and Equal Weighting** : The strategy involves annual rebalancing and equal weighting of the portfolio. This helps to adapt to changes in the market and maintain a balanced approach to capturing potential mispricing associated with R&D expenditures.

This paper provides a valuable insight into the underappreciation of R&D expenditures by the market, revealing that firms with substantial R&D investments relative to their market capitalization tend to outperform those with lower R&D expenditures. The idea of creating an alpha strategy by going long on firms with the highest R&D expenditures relative to market cap while shorting those with the lowest is compelling. This strategy capitalizes on the market’s potential underreaction to future growth opportunities driven by R&D spending. Incorporating this into a dynamic portfolio with annual rebalancing could be an interesting avenue to explore further.

Firms own both tangible assets (like equipment and inventory) and intangible assets (like workforce skills and R&D investments). While physical assets are easily valued, intangible assets, such as research and development (R&D) expenditures, can be harder to assess.

Research by Chan et al. (1999) highlighted a key finding:

- Firms with significant R&D spending often appear similarly valued to those without, based on traditional metrics like price-to-earnings ratios.
- However, R&D-heavy firms tend to have greater future growth potential, which the market often underestimates.

**Key Takeaways:**

- R&D spending is a long-term investment that doesn’t always align with current earnings.
- A strategy based on R&D expenditures relative to market cap shows that stocks of firms with high R&D investment often yield higher returns.

This highlights how inefficiencies in the market might misprice firms with significant intangible assets.

- Traditional measures (such as P/E and P/B ratios) assess firms primarily based on physical, measurable assets and immediate earnings.
- However, these metrics fail to account for intangible assets like R&D, which contribute to future growth but don't have an immediate impact on current earnings or book value.

"Great read! This paper sheds light on the importance of R&D expenditures as intangible assets that might be undervalued by the market. It’s interesting how firms with higher R&D relative to their market cap show better future returns. Applying this idea by going long on firms with high R&D expenditures and short on those with low R&D could be a powerful strategy. Thanks for sharing the approach; I’m looking forward to testing it!"

### lpha Inspiration] R&D Expenditures and Stock Returns

**Title and Author of the Article:**

- *The Effect of Research and Development on Firm Valuation: Evidence from the Market*  by Hall (1993)

**Alpha Inspiration Description:**

- The article explores the link between R&D expenditures and firm value, suggesting that increased investment in R&D can lead to higher future earnings and stock returns. R&D spending is a key indicator of a firm's potential for innovation, and therefore, future growth.
- Inspired by this concept, I propose an alpha strategy that uses R&D expenditure data to predict stock returns. Companies with higher than expected R&D spending might outperform, while those with lower than expected R&D spending may underperform, particularly over the long term.

**Related Dataset:**

- R&D Expenditures Data (annual or quarterly data on R&D investments)
- Stock Returns Data (long-term returns, such as 1-year, 3-year, etc.)
- Potentially, use fundamentals dataset for historical data on R&D and financial performance.

**(Optional) Current Performance of P&L or Matrix:**

- Backtesting results can show how stocks with high R&D expenditures perform relative to market benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500) over time.

**Questions and Improvement Ideas:**

- How does the sector of the company impact the relationship between R&D expenditures and stock returns? For example, tech companies may benefit more from high R&D compared to others.
- Should the alpha be adjusted for factors such as market conditions or the economic cycle?
