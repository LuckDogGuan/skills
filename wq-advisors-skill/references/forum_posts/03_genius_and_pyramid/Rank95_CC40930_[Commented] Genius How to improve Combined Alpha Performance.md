I am trying to increase sharpe in each alpha. Also trying to make alphas with lower correlation.
Can someone tell few ways to improve alpha performance? Can it be improved drastically or it will take a quarter or two to change Combined alpha performance?

You can look directly at PnL to predict the os. Focus on the last 1-2 years to see if pnl has a new high or not, check if you are using too many operators or data, because they can easily lead to overfit. Use some more custom backtests like sub sharpe, rank, sign test. You are right that submitting low alpha corr will help increase the combine os performance.

Hello use more dataset and also try to explore more than 2 regions where your idea should be tested

Hi NP53453!

While trying to improve alpha performance try to avoid overfitting - use Test period feature and additional tests.

Hi , try to keep good sharpe and fitness by using diverse datafields and operators and make Alphas across all the regions to bring diversity .

I think that when the submitted alpha has good os and diversification, the next criteria is the quantity of alpha. There are people who only need a few dozen alpha to reach combine sharpe >2, but there are also people who need more than 100, 200 alpha to reach this milestone.

To predict the out-of-sample (OS) performance, analyze PnL over the past 1-2 years to check for new highs. Assess whether excessive operators or data usage may cause overfitting. Incorporate custom backtests like sub-Sharpe, rank, or sign tests for deeper evaluation. Submitting low-correlation Alphas can enhance the combined OS performance, as they contribute to more diversified and robust results. This careful approach ensures better predictions and reduces the risk of overfitting.

Improving alpha performance takes time, but focusing on Sharpe ratio, reducing correlation, and diversifying operators can help. Experiment with new datasets, optimize combinations, and stay consistent for gradual results!

In my opinion, to improve Sharpe and reduce correlation, analyze PnL for trends, avoid overfitting, diversify datasets/regions, use custom backtests, and scale gradually. Focus on quality, then expand. Good luck!

Hello! To enhance combined performance, you can consider the following strategies:

1. Develop alphas with strong out-of-sample (OS) scores.
2. Ensure diversification within the alpha pool to reduce redundancy.
3. Minimize production correlation to improve the effectiveness of the combined model.

These steps can significantly contribute to achieving better overall results.

Recent PnL analysis (1-2 years) helps assess whether an alpha is at a new high or starting to overfit.

Avoid overfitting by using a minimal number of key operators and features.

Use custom backtests like Sub-Sharpe, rank tests, and sign tests to evaluate alpha robustness across different conditions.

Low alpha correlation is essential for improving combined out-of-sample performance, as it enhances diversification and reduces redundancy.

Always validate alphas using cross-validation and regularly monitor out-of-sample performance to ensure consistency and adaptability to changing market conditions.

This approach can help you refine your alphas, improve their predictive power, and ultimately lead to better risk-adjusted performance in both in-sample and out-of-sample testing.

Improving alpha performance, especially increasing the Sharpe ratio and reducing correlation, can be an iterative process, but there are several strategies you can apply to potentially see quicker improvements:

1. **Diversify Data Sources** : Use datasets from different domains, such as fundamentals, technical indicators, or sentiment data. This diversification helps in reducing correlation between alphas and improving overall robustness.

In addition to optimizing each alpha, you can improve performance by seeking out untapped alpha sources or those not tied to common market cycles. Combining alphas flexibly based on market conditions and incorporating technical or fundamental analysis can yield better results. Additionally, enhancing input features and testing models that are not fully optimized can also lead to sustainable improvements in combined alpha performance

Improving alpha performance, especially to increase Sharpe ratios and reduce correlation among alphas, is a continuous process. While drastic improvements can sometimes happen depending on the changes you make, it usually takes a quarter or two to notice significant improvements in  **Combined Alpha Performance** .

Improving combined alpha performance can be a complex task, but focusing on diversification is key. Consider exploring a variety of strategies that are fundamentally different to minimize correlation. Additionally, refining your risk management techniques could also enhance your Sharpe ratio. Have you looked into different market conditions and their effects on alpha performance over time? It might be interesting to evaluate how seasonal trends impact your alphas too.

Hmm, in my opinion, once the submitted alpha demonstrates strong operating system performance and diversification, the next key factor to consider is the amount of alpha. Some individuals may only require a few dozen alphas to achieve a Sharpe ratio above 2, while others might need more than 100 or even 200 alphas to reach the same benchmark.
