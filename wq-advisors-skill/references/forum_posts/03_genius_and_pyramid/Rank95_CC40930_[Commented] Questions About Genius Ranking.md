Hello everyone,

After seeing the Genius rankings, I noticed several issues with the way the Genius ranking is determined.

My account has met the main criteria: Signals, Pyramids Completed, and Combined Alpha Performance, which are sufficient for the Grandmaster rank. My alpha quality metrics are also very strong. However, when the Genius ranking was announced, I was only placed in the Gold rank.

I believe I performed well in the main criteria and alpha quality. Additionally, I excelled in challenging secondary metrics like Completed Referrals, but I still only received a Gold rank. It seems that the ranking relies heavily on Tie Breaker criteria, which are rather problematic and fail to accurately evaluate the quality of the alphas and the efforts of each Consultant. I hope Worldquant can clarify the Genius ranking criteria and perhaps prioritize consultants who excel in the main criteria, focusing on ranking based on the alpha quality of consultants. This would make the process less problematic and more fair to those who have worked hard to produce high-quality alphas, rather than relying on Tie Breaker criteria (as these do not seem to reflect alpha quality at all). I kindly ask Worldquant to review and provide more clarity on these criteria for a more accurate Genius ranking system.

I feel quite disheartened because I have performed very well in the main metrics, my alpha quality is excellent, and I’ve done well in secondary metrics like Completed Referrals. As a result, I am unsure what else I can improve to achieve a higher Genius rank under the current system.

Therefore, I hope that Worldquant can reconsider and reevaluate the Genius ranking criteria to more accurately assess the ranks of Consultants.

Thank you very much.

Hello,
Your performance in the main metrics is truly commendable, and your referrals are impressive too. It’s clear you’ve put in a lot of effort and dedication. What I think is that the lower number of distinct operators, high number of Operators and Fields per Alpha, and community activity might have impacted your ranking.

Don’t lose heart—this is a great opportunity to refine your approach! 
To reduce the "operators per alpha" and "fields per alpha," you can focus on using alphas with high Sharpe and fitness (as booster alpha), allowing you to achieve the required Sharpe and fitness with fewer datasets and operators.

> When you do less operators, your alpha will be shorter, less noisy. And it shows the ability to research and learn new ideas.

This is a double-edged sword, though, because while it's true the simplest necessary approach is always best, we cannot forget the word NECESSARY. Operations to normalize/standardize data are good practice, i.e. winsorize, scale, zscore, backfill, etc. They are not really adding unnecessary complexity, but rather ensuring data issues don't harm or dominate a result. On the otherhand, it makes perfect sense to discourage randomly nesting 10 operators.

As I type this, a partial solution comes to mind...we could (a) whitelist certain operators that are less likely to cause overfitting issues (maybe the cross-sectional operators?), and/or (b) set a limit to the lowest scorable # of operators/fields. Low fields can also be an issue, especially if we're just trying to neutralize against some risk factors. Just throwing out some ideas.

Just as an example, I've seen it often encouraged to neutralize -- bucket, densify, group_neutralize -- that's 3 dang operators right there, plus at least 1 field, and the way this is going one can only use 1-2 fields per alpha. So, just to do this would kinda meet your total alpha quota if you are aiming for the upper levels.

Your suggestion to prioritize the main criteria, particularly alpha quality, over secondary Tie Breaker metrics seems like a fair and logical adjustment.

Your suggestion it brings fairness to the alpha performance of quantitative researchers that need more attention than tie break. Hope there will be changes in the future to be able to improve more

I completely agree with you—it makes sense to reduce the weight of the tie-breaker. While it's tempting to focus on perfecting every detail, sometimes it's more about finding the right balance. The platform wants us to focus on quality and diversity, and following these guidelines will help in the long run. I know it can feel frustrating at times, but don't let it get you down. You're putting in great effort, and even if it doesn’t show immediately, your hard work will pay off. One idea to help you stay on top of your progress is to fetch data from the Genius Leaderboard via the API and rank it locally. This way, you can track your position over time and compare it to others, helping you refine your strategy for improvement. Keep going—you’re doing really well!

The thing is that more than 300 consultants satisfied the criterion to be Grandmaster although there are roughly 150 slots for Master + Grandmaster so as it was already stated in the FAQs tie breaker criterions would decide your level

Hello! I totally get your frustration with the Genius ranking—it's such a complex system! I think the emphasis on secondary metrics like Tie Breaker criteria can sometimes overshadow the real impact of our alpha quality and main metrics. As someone who's also explored the world of quant trading, I believe we should advocate for a system that genuinely reflects the hard work and innovative ideas we put into our models. It would be great if WorldQuant considered reevaluating the weighting of these metrics. Perhaps focusing more on the performance and quality of our alphas could really help streamline the ranking process. Let’s keep sharing our insights and supporting each other through this journey!

Your concerns about the Genius ranking system are valid, particularly if the current criteria overly emphasize Tie Breakers while undervaluing primary metrics like Signals, Pyramids Completed, and Combined Alpha Performance. Consultants who excel in alpha quality and challenging secondary metrics, like Completed Referrals, deserve better recognition.

Prioritizing  **alpha quality**  and performance in primary metrics would create a fairer ranking system and better reflect the efforts of hardworking consultants. Additionally, greater transparency about how rankings are determined would help consultants understand areas for improvement. I hope Worldquant reevaluates the system to ensure fairness and motivate contributors effectively. Thank you for sharing. 🚀

I totally understand your concerns about the Genius ranking! It can be quite discouraging when you feel your hard work in alpha quality isn't reflected in your rank. As a tech enthusiast and someone who dabbles in quantitative trading, I think it’s crucial for the community to push for a system that values main metrics like Signals and Alpha Performance over secondary Tie Breakers. It’s clear that many of us are dedicated to producing quality alphas, and a fairer ranking that truly reflects that effort would be beneficial. Let’s continue to support one another as we navigate these complexities! Keep refining your strategies; your effort will eventually shine through!

Explain the use of random matrix theory (RMT) in identifying noise components in large-scale correlation matrices, and how does eigenvalue clipping improve risk estimation?

### 评论 #13 (作者: QG16026, 时间: 1年前)

Based on the discussion, it seems that tie-breaker criteria are having a disproportionate impact on the Genius rankings, even when main metrics like Signals, Pyramids Completed, and Combined Alpha Performance are strong. Has anyone found effective strategies or adjustments in their alpha submission approach to minimize the influence of tie-breakers?

### 评论 #14 (作者: ND68030, 时间: 1年前)

Although alpha quality is an important factor, I believe that secondary metrics such as Completed Referrals also play a crucial role in determining the overall contribution of a Consultant. These factors not only reflect the ability to generate alpha but also demonstrate the level of engagement, commitment, and interaction with the community

### 评论 #20 (作者: AN95618, 时间: 1年前)

It is valuable to discuss the ranking criteria to ensure fairness and clarity in how ranks are determined. Since the main performance metrics were met alongside strong alpha quality, it would indeed be beneficial to have further transparency on how tie-breaker rules influence final rankings.

### 评论 #21 (作者: QN13195, 时间: 1年前)

It appears that the ranking system might not align well with performance expectations, especially regarding the weight of different criteria. Highlighting areas where the evaluation process could better reflect key contributions might encourage a more transparent assessment.
