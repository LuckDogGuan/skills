Hello everyone,

I am trying to generate alphas from a diverse range of datasets in IND, but this has been quite challenging. Most of the alphas I am able to submit tend to be concentrated in the risk, analyst, and model datasets. I would like to ask whether my alpha performance could be negatively affected if I submit too many alphas within a single dataset. Additionally, could you suggest some datasets that are relatively easy to combine in order to increase diversity.

Thank you very much.

Too many alphas from one dataset won’t hurt IS metrics directly, but correlation becomes the main issue. Mixing price, volume, and basic fundamental datasets with risk or analyst signals is often the easiest way to improve diversity.

Yes — submitting too many alphas from the  **same dataset (or highly related datasets)**  can absolutely hurt overall performance, even if individual alphas look reasonable on their own.

1. **Hidden correlation risk**
   Alphas derived from the same dataset (e.g., risk, analyst, or model) often share overlapping signals. Even if formulas differ, the underlying information content is similar, which increases  **cross-alpha correlation** .
2. **Diminishing marginal contribution**
   After a few strong alphas from one dataset, additional ones usually add noise rather than diversification. This reduces portfolio-level IR and can worsen drawdowns.
3. **Overfitting to one data source**
   Heavy reliance on a single dataset increases the chance that performance is regime-specific and may decay faster out-of-sample.
4. **Internal correlation penalties**
   high similarity across submitted alphas reduces effective weight or acceptance probability due to correlation filters.

Submitting too many alphas in one dataset dilutes performance due to redundancy and correlation. Overcrowding increases internal competition, raises turnover, and amplifies noise. Marginal alphas add little incremental IC, weaken ensemble Sharpe, and risk overfitting, making the combined signal less robust out-of-sample.

Theoretically, if the self correlation of your basket is not high, e.g. always lower than 0.5, then it is still good I think.

To improve diversity in IND, try mixing simpler, broadly available datasets such as price/volume (returns, volatility, turnover), fundamentals (valuation ratios, growth, balance-sheet stability), and basic alternative proxies (liquidity, dispersion, seasonality).

This is a very relevant concern, especially once you start moving from isolated submissions to  **portfolio-level thinking** . Submitting many alphas derived from the same dataset can indeed have a negative impact, not necessarily because each alpha is weak on its own, but because they often share  **latent exposures** . Even when formulas look different, alphas built from the same dataset tend to be structurally correlated, which reduces marginal contribution once they are aggregated or evaluated together. This becomes more visible in Pyramids, where redundancy shows up as unstable incremental Sharpe.

To mitigate this, I usually think in terms of  **economic dimensions**  rather than dataset labels. For example, analyst data can be complemented by price-based momentum, liquidity measures, or balance-sheet stability signals to diversify drivers. In IND, datasets related to size, trading activity, or simple accounting ratios are often easier to combine because they operate on different timescales. The goal isn’t to avoid repetition entirely, but to ensure each alpha adds a distinct mechanism rather than a slightly different view of the same information.

Submitting too many alphas built on the same dataset often dilutes performance because of redundancy and high correlation. This overcrowding creates internal competition, increases turnover, and amplifies noise, while marginal alphas contribute little incremental IC and can weaken ensemble Sharpe. In the end, excessive overlap raises overfitting risk and makes the combined signal less robust out-of-sample.

Submitting too many alphas based on the same dataset can indirectly hurt performance, as they often share similar signals and increase alpha–alpha correlation, reducing diversification and marginal contribution. To improve diversity, try using different datasets, such as fundamental data with price or trend signals and sentiment data. Focusing on different information horizons and economic intuition helps create more robust and diversified alphas.

Loading a single dataset with too many alphas often backfires. As overlap and correlation grow, performance gets diluted rather than enhanced. Excessive crowding creates internal competition, pushes turnover higher, and magnifies noise instead of signal. Weaker, marginal alphas contribute little new information, drag down ensemble Sharpe, and increase the risk of overfitting—ultimately leaving the combined signal more fragile when tested out of sample.

Some Fundamental, Analyst, and Model datasets can generate a wide variety of diverse signals, so I wouldn’t worry too much about that. The real caution is when you overload on data like  **imb, inst, mcr, nws, social media** , etc.—you need to be really careful.  *(JZC)*

To increase diversity in IND, consider combining simple, widely available data sources such as price and volume measures (returns, volatility, turnover), fundamental signals (valuation, growth, balance-sheet strength), and basic alternative proxies like liquidity, dispersion, or seasonality.

Many Fundamental, Analyst, and Model datasets are rich enough to support a wide spectrum of distinct signals, so this generally isn’t a major concern.

This is an important issue, particularly once research shifts from individual alpha submissions to portfolio-level construction. Submitting many alphas built on the same dataset can be counterproductive, not because the signals are weak in isolation, but because they often share hidden structural exposures. Even when formulas appear different, alphas derived from the same underlying data tend to be correlated, which limits their incremental value when evaluated together. This effect becomes especially clear in Pyramids, where redundancy often manifests as unstable or disappointing incremental Sharpe. To address this, it helps to think in terms of economic drivers rather than dataset names. For instance, analyst-based signals can be balanced with momentum, liquidity, or balance-sheet stability ideas to diversify underlying mechanisms. In the IND universe, size, trading activity, and simple accounting metrics are often easier to combine since they operate on different horizons. The objective is not to eliminate overlap entirely, but to ensure each alpha contributes a genuinely distinct source of information.

This usually doesn’t hurt performance directly, but it does increase correlation risk. When many alphas come from the same dataset, they often express similar information, so combined metrics can flatten out. It’s better to balance them with structurally different datasets. In IND, combining risk or analyst data with price-based or volume/liquidity signals often helps improve diversity and stability.

Yes, submitting too many alphas from the same dataset can hurt overall performance even if individual Sharpe looks fine. The main issue is  **hidden correlation** —alphas built on the same data source often extract similar information, leading to high production correlation and diminishing marginal contribution at the combined or pool level. To improve diversity, it helps to mix “easy-to-use” but conceptually different datasets, such as  **price/volume with analyst data** ,  **risk with fundamentals** , or  **model outputs with sentiment** , and apply neutralization techniques (e.g., vector_neut or group_neutralize) to reduce overlap and improve incremental value.
