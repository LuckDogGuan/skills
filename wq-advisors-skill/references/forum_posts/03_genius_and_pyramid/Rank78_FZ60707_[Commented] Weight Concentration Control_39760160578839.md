When building alphas that require controlled exposure and reduced weight concentration, handling skewed or uneven distributions becomes important.

If you’re facing weight imbalance issues, consider using  **z-score normalization ( `z-score` )**  to standardize signal distribution, and  **time-series backfill ( `ts_backfill(x, d)` )**  to handle missing or sparse data more smoothly across time.

Together, these techniques help produce more stable, well-behaved signals with reduced distortion from extreme or missing values.
Lemme know what you think in the comment section.

Great tip! I'd also add that applying a  **capping/flooring**  step after z-score (e.g., winsorizing at 3 or 4 sigma) can further reduce the impact of extreme weights. Combining  `ts_backfill`  with  `group_backfill`  can also help when the missing patterns differ across assets. Have you experimented with decay factors in the backfill window to give more weight to recent observations? Thanks for sharing!
