**Direct Turnover / Position-Limiting Operators**

These operators control  **how much positions change over time** , so they can increase or decrease turnover depending on your settings:

- **hump(x, hump=0.01)**  → Currently  *limits*  changes in the signal. To increase turnover, you could  **reduce its effect**  (use a higher hump value or remove it) so signals move more freely.
- **ts_decay_linear(x, d, dense=false)**  → Linear decay reduces the impact of older signals, smoothing positions. Using  **shorter decay windows**  increases turnover because new information has more effect.
- **ts_decay_exp_window(x, d, factor=f)**  → Exponential decay; smaller factor = faster response = higher turnover.
- **ts_delta_limit(x, y, limit_volume=0.1)**  → Restricts change in position relative to some volume. Increasing limit_volume allows bigger moves → higher turnover.
- **trade_when(x, y, z)**  → Only executes trades when a condition is met. Loosening conditions (or removing unnecessary filters) increases turnover.

Thank you for sharing such a detailed explanation of turnover operators. This really helps in understanding how different parameters affect trading behavior.

Thanks for this clear breakdown! One thing to add:  `ts_rank`  with a short window can also increase turnover by making the signal more reactive to recent price moves, while a long window smooths it out. Also, combining  `ts_delta_limit`  with a dynamic limit (e.g., based on trailing volume) can help control turnover more adaptively. Do you have a rule of thumb for choosing  `hump`  values in  `hump()` ?

Turnover is increased by using faster-reacting operators like shorter ts_decay windows, higher decay factors, and relaxed ts_delta_limit. Removing or weakening hump also increases responsiveness. Turnover is reduced by stronger smoothing, tighter limits, and stricter trade_when conditions that restrict frequent position changes.

> This is a really clear breakdown of turnover control. I like how you show that these operators aren’t just for  *reducing*  turnover—they can be tuned both ways depending on the goal.
> I’ve noticed that small tweaks, like shortening decay windows or relaxing  `trade_when`  conditions, can change turnover a lot more than expected. It’s a good reminder that turnover is something you  **engineer** , not just observe.
> Finding that balance between responsiveness and stability is where the real work is.

Really insightful breakdown, especially the link between decay speed and signal responsiveness. I think many overlook how reducing hump or shortening decay windows can dramatically increase reactivity, but at the cost of stability. Have you found a good balance between turnover and signal noise when combining ts_decay with trade_when filters?

More smoothing → less turnover. More reactivity → more turnover. Noted, thanks for sharing this 🙏

Good breakdown. These operators are essential for balancing responsiveness and turnover, especially when optimizing after-cost performance.

I’ve noticed that small tweaks, like shortening decay windows or relaxing  `trade_when`  conditions, can change turnover a lot more than expected. It’s a good reminder that turnover is something you  **engineer** , not just observe.

These operators are valuable because they help control signal responsiveness, trading frequency, and position changes. When used appropriately, they can reduce unnecessary noise, improve stability, manage turnover, and make alphas more robust under realistic trading conditions.
