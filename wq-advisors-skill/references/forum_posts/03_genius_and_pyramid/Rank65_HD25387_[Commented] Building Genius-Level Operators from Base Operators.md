In this series, we explore how to construct advanced Genius-level operators using only base operators. This is especially helpful if you’re still at a beginner or intermediate level in Genius but want to implement complex ideas without waiting to unlock advanced functionality.

🔹 Today’s focus:  **s_log_1p**  Operator
 The  *s_log_1p* operator is designed to confine a function to a shorter range using logarithmic scaling. Its key property is that higher inputs remain higher, negative inputs remain negative, and the output approaches -1 or 1 as asymptotes.

We can build it using just three base operators: sign, log, and abs.

Formula:

***s_log_1p(x) = sign(x) * log(1 + abs(x))***

This ensures smooth scaling while preserving the direction of the input.

- With this trick, you can implement ideas that rely on Genius-level operators even when they’re not directly available.

Stay tuned for more operator breakdowns and keep experimenting—happy learning!

The  `s_log_1p`  operator can be built using just base operators:  `sign` ,  `log` , and  `abs` . Formula:  `s_log_1p(x) = sign(x) * log(1 + abs(x))` . It scales inputs smoothly, keeps the sign, and approaches -1 or 1 as asymptotes, letting you mimic Genius-level functionality with basic operators.

Great breakdown! I’ve used  `s_log_1p`  before but didn’t realize it could be reconstructed so elegantly from base operators. This kind of modular thinking really helps when working with limited tool access. Looking forward to the next one!

Great insight! Very inspiring and helpful for deeper research. I’ll definitely try experimenting with this approach.

Very insightful breakdown! I really like how you decomposed  `s_log_1p`  into base operators—this makes it much clearer for beginners to experiment. I’ve also noticed that applying this transformation before normalization (e.g.,  `zscore` ) can reduce the impact of extreme outliers while still preserving the signal’s directionality. Have you tried combining  `s_log_1p`  with decay functions to see how stability changes?

This approach is perfect for  **normalizing highly skewed factors**  like market cap or volume where you want to dampen the impact of mega-cap stocks without losing the ranking structure. The asymptotic behavior at ±1 is particularly useful for portfolio construction.

Quick question: Have you found this manual construction performs identically to the native  **s_log_1p**  in terms of computational efficiency, or is there a performance trade-off?

This is a great illustration of how to reconstruct Genius-level functionality with just base operators. The  `s_log_1p(x) = sign(x) * log(1 + abs(x))`  formulation is particularly powerful because it dampens extreme values while preserving directional information—an essential property when handling highly skewed features such as market cap, volume, or analyst revisions. One advantage of reconstructing it manually is that you can also experiment with variations, such as scaling the input before transformation (e.g.,  `s_log_1p(x / k)` ) to control sensitivity, or combining with decay operators ( `ts_decay_linear` ) to smooth out short-term fluctuations after compression. In practice, I’ve found that applying  `s_log_1p`  before rank or z-score normalization reduces the influence of outliers without discarding information, which helps stabilize alphas across different regimes. While the manual construction is mathematically identical to the Genius operator, runtime efficiency might vary depending on system optimization—so it’s worth testing performance trade-offs if you plan to scale across large universes. Still, this modular approach makes complex transformations accessible even at earlier Genius levels.

Exactly—this manual normalization dampens extreme values while keeping relative rankings intact. The ±1 asymptote is great for stabilizing portfolio weights. In practice, it’s usually slightly slower than native  `s_log_1p` , but the trade-off is minimal unless applied to massive universes.
