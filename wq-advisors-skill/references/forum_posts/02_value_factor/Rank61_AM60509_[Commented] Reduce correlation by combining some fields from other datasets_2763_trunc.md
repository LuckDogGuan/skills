## 帖子正文

Hi everyone. While generating alpha I found that some datasets have much higher correlations than others. Should I reduce the correlations of those alphas by combining some Fields from other datasets in the same category? Or from other datasets in different categories? Will this cause performance degradation on the OS?

I think it is preferred to use data from a single dataset rather than other categories but as long as your alpha is fundamentally strong and not overfitted the OS performance will be good in either of the cases so it's up to you which one to use.

In addition to what  [VV63697](/hc/en-us/profiles/22631087402903-VV63697)  said - while the combination should make sense you should also check for coverage of both the data fields from different categories while combining them to make an alpha. At times the coverage may be lower for one dataset and combining it with another datafield may lead to a good IS sharpe but with low coverage - and this could just be a case of overfitting possibly due to one of the datafield used or because of the smaller amount of coverage, and could possibly erode the performance of your original alpha idea.

You can try unlinear-combination, such as using if/else combination. It will be best if you can filter some condition with logic back ground. Eg: if price_volume is high correlation alpha, you want to combine with social media is low correlation alpha:

If(arg_max(close,5) <1  (date with near the peak of alpha)

then social media data (near peak mean more favor on social media)

else reversal idea (keep price-volume high correlation idea)

Thanks for your reply. I think I will aim to use only a single Dataset with alpha sets that are easy to generate alpha for submission and only mix in other datasets with more specific and difficult to generate alpha data.

It probably makes your OS performance worse, if you're just adding noise.

Hi, you can create alpha on new regions like twn, hkg, kor or jpn, amr. These regions still have low alpha submitted in pool consultant. Balance between the amount of data and operator used because it can affect tie break genius, however if the correlation is high it will reduce the value factor.

Combining fields from other datasets to reduce correlation should be done with caution. The key is to ensure that the data combination is fundamentally justified and enhances the alpha's signal rather than introducing noise, which could potentially degrade the performance in the operating system. This approach should aim to strengthen the alpha's predictive power without overcomplicating the model or reducing the coverage, thus maintaining the balance between diversification and clarity of the alpha's underlying logic.

If you’re combining fields to reduce correlation, I’d say stick to one dataset if you can. It’s simpler and safer if your alpha is strong. If you mix datasets, make sure it adds value without adding noise or losing coverage.

Combining alphas in order to reduce correlation is a better way than overfitting the alphas but still not the best way.Try to use single dataset alphas and if you are forced to use to combine alphas ,then combine alphas using the same dataset

You could attempt to reduce correlation by combining fields from different categories, but it is important to test this strategy to ensure it doesn’t degrade model performance. Alphas from different categories can provide more independent signals, potentially improving overall model performance.Make sure to test the model’s performance after making these changes and consider any computational overhead on the system.

Combining fields from other datasets can help reduce correlations, but it’s crucial to maintain the economic intuition of your alpha. Mixing categories could introduce noise or dilute signal strength, potentially affecting OS performance. Test extensively in-sample and out-of-sample to ensure robustness.

Thank you for your continued guidance and support. Your insights are always invaluable, helping me grow and refine my approach. I deeply appreciate your time and expertise in this journey

Combining fields from other datasets requires careful consideration to ensure the integration is fundamentally sound and enhances the alpha's signal. The goal is to improve predictive power without adding noise, preserving model simplicity, maintaining coverage, and balancing diversification with the clarity of the alpha’s underlying logic.

Some tips to reduce correlation for your alphas -

1) Use uncommon operators like vector_neut, vector_proj, regression _neut and regression proj while making your alphas.

2) Use group operators with custom neutralisations using different kinds of data. Eg. Group_coalesce, group_cartesian_product, etc. work extremely well.

3) While building alphas filter datasets based on the number of alphas it has and spend time on understanding the dataset that has the least number of alphas, read some literature on it and then think which operator would work the best with that kind of data. You'll mostly come up with a submittable alpha with less self and prod corr if you follow this.

I'll keep adding more ideas to this thread. Let me know if it helped you!

Great question! High correlations in datasets can indeed lead to redundancy in the alpha signals, potentially reducing diversification. Combining fields from other datasets—either within the same category or across different categories—could help reduce this issue, but the impact on out-of-sample (OS) performance depends on how you approach it:

1. **Within the same category:**  Combining related fields may help capture complementary aspects of the same underlying phenomenon. However, be cautious about introducing multicollinearity, as it could lead to overfitting.
2. **Across different categories:**  This approach might introduce diversity and reduce correlation more effectively. It could also help generalize the alpha signals better, but ensure that the new fields are conceptually relevant to avoid introducing noise.

Reducing correlation is a good idea, but ensure the combination of fields is meaningful. Start with datasets within the same category to avoid unnecessary noise. If mixing categories, test thoroughly for OS performance and focus on alphas with strong economic intuition to maintain robustness.

Combining fields from different datasets, especially across categories, can help reduce correlation and improve the robustness of your alphas.  But you need to make sure the combination make economic sense, otherwise it may increase the risk of overfitting. Simple to combine two fields randomly is not a good way to increase the quanlity of your alpha.

Ensure data combination is justified to enhance alpha signal, not add noise. Focus on new regions (TWN, HKG, KOR, JPN, AMR) with low alpha submissions. Balance data quantity and operators to avoid tie-break issues. High correlation weakens factor value. Keep it clear and effective.

Hi, I appreciate your insights on combining fields to reduce correlation. As a new trader, I'm still navigating through the complexities of quant strategies. I wonder, if I stick to a single dataset, will that limit my ability to discover unique alpha signals? Or is it safer to mix in other datasets for broader perspectives, as long as I ensure there's a solid economic rationale? Balancing simplicity and robustness is key, but I've seen many mixed opinions on this. I'm committed to learning more about these strategies, so any further advice would be greatly appreciated!

Reducing correlation by combining alphas is preferable to overfitting but not the optimal approach. Ideally, use single-dataset alphas, and if combining is necessary, ensure they come from the same dataset.

Hi  [LN92324](/hc/en-us/profiles/4601131163927-LN92324)  &  [顾问 CT68712 (Rank 27)](/hc/en-us/profiles/15219840701719-顾问 CT68712 (Rank 27)) !

Do avoid combining datasets for the sake of reducing production correlation. Yes, it could affect your OS performance on an individual alpha basis, and on your pool of alphas too.

That said, if your combination makes sense for your alpha idea, such as forming a ratio using a fundamental data field with a price volume data field, or including a group data field from another dataset to perform group neutralisation, then it could potentially work. Just avoid adding up multiple data fields or signals together.

Merging fields from different datasets to lower correlation can be useful, but it’s important to do it thoughtfully. The key is making sure the combination actually improves the alpha’s signal rather than adding noise that could hurt OS performance. It’s all about striking a balance—enhancing predictive power while keeping the model clear and not overly complex. Overfitting or reducing data coverage could weaken the alpha’s effectiveness.

Great question! Reducing correlation by incorporating fields from other datasets can be effective, but it depends on  **how**  you combine them. Here are a few key considerations:

**Mixing Fields from Different Categories**  – Combining datasets from different categories (e.g., fundamental + technical or alternative data) can help diversify signals and lower correlation.

**Avoid Overfitting**  – If you simply add more features without a clear rationale, it may reduce correlation but could lead to OS performance degradation.

**Check for Complementary Signals**  – Ensure the new fields provide  **unique information**  rather than being highly correlated with your existing alpha.

**Test Different Transformations**  – Using methods like  `group_neutralize` ,  `zscore` , or  `regression_neut`  can help refine signals before combining them.

Hi, could you consider creating alpha for new regions like TWN, HKG, KOR, or JPN, as well as AMR? These regions currently have a low number of alpha submissions in the pool consultant, and expanding focus there could help diversify and strengthen the overall strategy.

Although it analyzes the pros and cons of various situations, it fails to provide clear methods or guiding principles on how to determine which fields are suitable for combination and how to achieve the best combination. It could further explore statistical methods or empirical rules to assist in decision - making.
