### Rethinking My Alpha Generation Strategy and Declining Metrics

- Over the past few months, I have significantly changed my approach to creating and submitting alphas on the Brain platform.
- Earlier, I used to combine multiple signals and data fields from different datasets to design alphas with strong metrics — including a high Sharpe ratio, solid fitness score, favorable return-to-drawdown ratio, and healthy margin.
- Recently, I shifted my strategy to create alphas that more closely resemble  **ATOM alphas** ,  **Power Pool alphas** , and  **single-signal dataset alphas** .
- However, since adopting this approach, my overall performance metrics have noticeably declined.
- In particular, my  **Value Factor**  and  **Weight Factor**  have been consistently decreasing over the past three months.
- I find it quite challenging to achieve good results using  **single-dataset-based alphas** , as they often compromise on Sharpe or fitness.
- I would like to understand:
  - What approach generally works best for improving  **Weight Factor**  and  **Value Factor** ?
  - How can I optimize single-dataset alphas without significantly compromising on performance metrics?

Great question — and it’s one that many consultants are currently exploring under the  *single-dataset alpha theme* . When moving from multi-dataset to single-dataset design, a drop in performance metrics (Sharpe, fitness, or Value/Weight factors) is quite normal at first, because the new setup restricts feature diversity and cross-signal reinforcement.

This is a fantastic question and a common struggle! The drop is likely due to losing the  **cross-dataset diversification**  that naturally boosted your metrics. For single-dataset alphas, I've found improving the  **Weight Factor**  often comes down to better handling  **liquidity and turnover**  within that one dataset

That’s a really thoughtful reflection — single-dataset alphas can indeed be tougher to optimize since they lack the natural diversification of multi-source blends. One approach is to  **focus on signal refinement**  rather than dataset breadth: experiment with transformations like  `ts_decay` ,  `power` , or  `zscore`  to extract stronger structure from limited inputs. Also, try adjusting  **neutralization and decay parameters**  to stabilize turnover and improve VF consistency. For Weight Factor, emphasizing balanced exposure across regions or groups often helps. It’s a subtle art — precision and depth matter more than size in single-dataset design.

That’s a very thoughtful observation — single-dataset alphas are often harder to optimize because they don’t benefit from the inherent diversification that comes from mixing multiple data sources. A useful strategy is to concentrate on refining the signal itself: experiment with transformations like ts_decay, power, zscore, or other stabilizing operators to draw out more meaningful structure from the limited inputs. Adjusting neutralization and decay settings can also help control turnover and improve VF consistency. When tuning the Weight Factor, focusing on balanced exposure across regions or groups often strengthens overall behavior. With single-dataset designs, precision and depth matter far more than breadth, so the key is extracting maximum insight from minimal ingredients.
