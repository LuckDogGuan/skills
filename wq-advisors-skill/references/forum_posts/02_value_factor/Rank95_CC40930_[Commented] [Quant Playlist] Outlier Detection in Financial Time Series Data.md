## Outlier Detection in Financial Time Series Data

Hello! Today's topic is outlier detection techniques. Below is the agenda we have prepared:

## **1. Overview of Outlier Detection**

#### **Definition and Importance of Outlier Detection**

Outlier detection refers to the process of identifying data points that deviate significantly from general patterns. In financial data, detecting outliers is crucial for variables like stock prices, trading volumes, and returns.

Outliers must be detected and handled because they can impact data analysis in the following ways:

1. **Degraded Model Performance**
   - Distorts data distributions, preventing models from learning patterns effectively.
2. **Errors in Risk Management**
   - May lead to inaccurate investment decisions due to excessive volatility or incorrect risk assessment.
3. **Distorted Analytical Results**
   - Skews key statistics like mean and standard deviation, leading to incorrect conclusions.

## **2. What Are Outliers in Financial Time Series Data?**

#### **Definition of Outliers**

Outliers are abnormal data points that deviate significantly from the general distribution of the data. In financial data, noise, data entry errors, or unusual events are common causes of outliers.

1. #### **Types of Outliers**
   - **Univariate Outliers**
   - Occur when a value in a single variable deviates from the normal distribution.
   - Example: A sudden sharp rise or fall in stock prices on a specific day.
   - **Multivariate Outliers**
   - Detected when the relationship between multiple variables indicates abnormality.
   - Example: A stock's price increases, but trading volume remains unusually low.
   - **Contextual Outliers**
   - Abnormal data points when viewed in the context of time or other environmental factors.
   - Example: A stock with a typical daily fluctuation of 1–2% suddenly fluctuates by more than 10%.
   - **Collective Outliers**
   - Data points that are normal individually but exhibit abnormal patterns when grouped together.
   - Example: A stock consistently exhibits low trading volume over a long period.

## **3. Outlier Detection Methods**

#### **(1) IQR (Interquartile Range)**

- **Concept** :
  - A simple statistical method that identifies outliers based on quartiles. It uses the middle range of the data for detection.
- **Calculation Method** :

> IQR

> [!NOTE] [图片 OCR 识别内容]
> Lower Bound
> 01
> 1.5 X
> IQR
> Upper Bound
> 03
> 1.5
> IQR


- **Advantages** :
  - Simple and intuitive.
  - No prior assumptions about data distribution are required.
- **Disadvantages** :
  - Accuracy decreases for asymmetrical data.

#### **(2) Z-Score**

- **Concept** ::
  Measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. Typically, ∣Z∣>3 indicates an outlier.
- **Calculation Method** :
  1. Compute the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).
  2. Calculate the Z-Score for each data point

- **Advantages** :
  - Effective for symmetric data distributions.
  - Clear detection criteria.
- **Disadvantages** :
  - Not reliable for skewed data or when extreme values distort the mean and standard deviation.

#### **(3) LOF (Local Outlier Factor)**

- **Concept** :
  - A density-based method that compares the density of a data point to its neighbors to detect outliers.
- **Calculation Method** :
  1. Calculate the k-nearest neighbors for each data point.
  2. Compare the density of the point to the density of its neighbors.
  3. Points with significantly lower densities are identified as outliers.
- **Advantages** :
  - Works well with non-linear data.
  - Effectively detects outliers in low-density regions.
- **Disadvantages** :
  - Computationally expensive.
  - Results are sensitive to the choice of k.

#### **(4) Isolation Forest**

- **Concept** :
  - Detects outliers by randomly isolating data points. Points that are easier to isolate are considered outliers.
- **Calculation Method** :
  1. Perform random splitting to isolate data points.
  2. Calculate the path length (number of splits) for each point.
  3. Points with shorter path lengths are considered outliers.
- **Advantages** :
  - Effective for high-dimensional data.
  - Fast for large datasets.
- **Disadvantages** :
  - Requires pre-setting the contamination rate (percentage of outliers), which can be challenging.

Outlier detection in financial time series data is crucial for improving data quality, enhancing model performance, and ensuring reliable analytical results.

- **IQR and Z-Score** : Simple and intuitive methods suitable for basic outlier detection.
- **LOF and Isolation Forest** : Effective for detecting outliers in multi-dimensional or non-linear data.

Detecting and handling outliers can improve the accuracy of data analysis and efficiently manage investment risks. Choose the right outlier detection method to derive better insights from financial data! 😊

The Z-score method identifies outliers by measuring how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. A high Z-score indicates that a data point is far from the mean, thus a potential outlier.

Once detected, outliers should not always be discarded. Depending on the context, it might be more appropriate to cap, transform, or impute them, especially if they represent real-world phenomena like spikes in trading volume or extreme market reactions.

Outlier detection is indeed a critical component in financial data analysis, as it helps to ensure that models and decisions are not influenced by anomalous data points that could distort the results.

These outliers occur when a value in a single variable deviates from the normal distribution. For example, a sudden sharp rise or fall in stock prices on a specific day could be considered an univariate outlier, as it significantly deviates from expected patterns.

Outlier detection involves identifying data points that deviate significantly from the general pattern of the data. In the context of financial time series data, these deviations can represent anomalies, fraudulent activities, or sudden market changes that need further investigation.

The Z-score is a straightforward and effective way to detect outliers, especially in data that follows a normal distribution. It's particularly useful for quickly identifying anomalies that could skew analysis. Let me know if you'd like to discuss scenarios where alternative methods might be more suitable!

The OS score helps to detect whether an alpha is  **overfitted**  to the In-Sample data (i.e., the model performs well in the historical data but fails to generalize to future data). A high performance during the In-Sample period might not necessarily translate to good performance in future periods if the alpha is overly tailored to past data.

**Handling MCAR** : Since the missing data does not affect the analysis, you can generally ignore the missing data without introducing bias. Common approaches include:

- **Deletion** : Simply remove the rows with missing data (listwise deletion or pairwise deletion).
- **Imputation** : Fill in the missing values using statistical methods like the mean, median, or mode (for continuous or categorical data).

Moments are a set of statistical measures that provide insight into the shape of a data distribution. They are important for understanding not only where the center of the data lies but also the spread and skewness of the data. Moments are defined as the expected values of certain powers of the deviations from a central point (usually the mean).

Typically, fitness refers to how well the alpha performs in terms of profitability, risk-adjusted returns (e.g., Sharpe ratio), and stability. This could include performance metrics like total return, maximum drawdown, and Sharpe ratio.

It’s possible that your alphas are not capturing nonlinear relationships with the value factor. Try introducing models that can capture such interactions, such as tree-based models (like Random Forests or XGBoost) or neural networks. These models can better understand how different factors combine and interact, which could enhance the performance of your value factor.

Here’s a potential scenario: If you're using  **leverage** , the total dollars traded could be much higher than your actual capital. For example, if you're trading with 5x leverage, for every $1 of your own capital, you're actually trading $5 in total. So, the  **Total Dollars Traded**  will reflect this amplified position size.

However,  **PnL**  only reflects the return on the actual capital you invested, not the total leveraged capital.

Outlier detection is all about spotting data points that stand out from the norm. In financial time series, these anomalies could signal anything from market shocks to potential fraud. Identifying them early can help refine strategies, manage risk, and uncover hidden insights worth investigating.
