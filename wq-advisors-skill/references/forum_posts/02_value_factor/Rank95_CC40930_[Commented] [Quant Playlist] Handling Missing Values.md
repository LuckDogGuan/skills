## **Handling Missing Values**

Hello. The topic is how to handle missing values. The agenda prepared is as follows.

### **Agenda**

1. Types of Missing Values
2. How to Handle Missing Values
3. Considerations for Handling Missing Values

## **1. Types of missing values**

Missing values ​​are one of the most common problems in data analysis, and if handled incorrectly, they can have a serious impact on the analysis results. Therefore, handling missing values ​​appropriately is very important for deriving reliable analysis results.

Missing values ​​are classified as follows based on the cause:

1. **MCAR (Missing Completely At Random)**
2. **MAR (Missing At Random)**
3. **NMAR (Not Missing At Random)**

## **2. How to handle missing values**

How to handle missing values ​​depends on the nature of the data and the analysis goals. Typical methods include:

#### **(1) Delete Data**

- Remove rows or columns that contain missing values.
- Appropriate when: Missing values ​​are very small in the overall data and data loss does not significantly affect the analysis results.

```
pythondf.dropna(inplace=True)df.dropna(axis=1, inplace=True)
```

#### **(2) Imputation**

As a way to replace missing values ​​with other values, you can use the following methods:

**1. Mean** :

```
pythondf['column'].fillna(df['column'].mean(), inplace=True)
```

**2. Median** :

```
pythondf['column'].fillna(df['column'].median(), inplace=True)
```

**3. Mode** :

```
pythondf['column'].fillna(df['column'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
```

**4. Advanced Methods** :

#### **(3) Model-based replacement**

- Set the variable with missing values ​​as the dependent variable, and use other variables as independent variables to create a prediction model to replace the missing values.
- Suitable when: the data is large enough, and the distribution of missing values ​​is correlated with a specific variable.

```
pythonfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputerimputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')df['column'] = imputer.fit_transform(df[['column']])
```

#### **(4) Marking the missing value.**

- Include missing values ​​in the data by marking them as 0, -1, or as separate labels.
- Appropriate when: The missing values ​​themselves contain important information.python

```
df['column'].fillna(-1, inplace=True)
```

## **3. Considerations when handling missing data**

1. **Identify patterns in missing data:**
   Explore whether missing data are associated with specific variables or patterns.
2. **Minimize data loss:**
   Choose methods that make the most of your data when possible.
3. **Align with analysis goals:**
   Consider in advance how your missing data handling method will affect your analysis results.

Appropriately handling missing values ​​is essential to increasing reliability in data analysis. There are a variety of methods to handle missing values, from simple imputation to advanced predictive models, and it is important to choose the method that best suits the characteristics of the data and the analysis goals. Now, apply the appropriate missing value handling method to derive more sophisticated analysis results!

K-NN imputation is a method where missing values in a dataset are replaced with the values of the "k" nearest neighbors. This method uses the similarity between rows based on their feature values to predict the missing values. For each missing value, it looks for the "k" closest data points (neighbors) and averages their values (or takes the most common class if it's a categorical variable).

A simple solution is to use the operators  *ts_mean* or  *ts_median* , which can completely eliminate Missing Values.

Additionally, there are more advanced operators that can achieve the same result. You may consider:

- *nan_mask(x, y)*
- *to_nan(x, value=0, reverse=true)*
- *ts_decay_linear(x, d, dense=false)*

(Note: Some operators may be restricted depending on your level, such as Genius, so access might be limited.)

Properly addressing missing values can significantly enhance the quality and accuracy of your analysis. Here are a few methods for handling missing values, depending on the data type and analysis goals:

1. **Simple Imputation** :
   - **Mean/Median Imputation** : For numerical data, missing values can be replaced with the mean (or median) of the column. This is suitable for data where the missingness is random and does not carry additional information.
   - **Mode Imputation** : For categorical data, replacing missing values with the mode (most frequent value) works well when the data is categorical and missing values are few.
2. **Advanced Imputation** :
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** : This method imputes missing values based on the values of the nearest neighbors. It works well when the data has a clear relationship between instances.
   - **Multiple Imputation** : A more robust method, which creates several imputed datasets and combines the results to account for the uncertainty of imputed values.
3. **Predictive Modeling** :
   - **Regression Imputation** : Use regression models to predict missing values based on other features. This method works well when there is a strong relationship between variables.
   - **Machine Learning Models** : For more complex datasets, models like Random Forest or XGBoost can predict missing values using other features.
4. **Removing Missing Data** :
   - **Listwise Deletion** : In cases where the missing data is random and not too extensive, rows with missing values can be discarded. This is suitable when the dataset is large and the removal won't significantly affect the results.
   - **Pairwise Deletion** : In some cases, you can ignore missing values on a case-by-case basis when performing calculations or analyses that don't require complete data for all variables.
5. **Using Indicator Variables** :
   - Sometimes, it's valuable to create an indicator variable to indicate whether a value was missing or imputed, which can help retain information about the missingness and potentially enhance predictive power.

Selecting the best method depends on the nature of your dataset, the amount of missing data, and the goals of your analysis. Experimenting with different methods and assessing their impact on model performance is key.

Handling missing values correctly is crucial to avoid biased or unreliable analysis. The classification of missing values into  **MCAR**  (Missing Completely at Random),  **MAR**  (Missing at Random), and  **NMAR**  (Not Missing at Random) helps determine the best strategy. Simple methods like mean imputation are suitable for MCAR, while more advanced techniques such as regression or KNN are better for MAR. For NMAR, specialized methods may be required to reduce bias and ensure accuracy.

Sometimes, the value factor may not show impressive raw returns, but adjusting for risk might reveal its true potential. Look at the value factor’s Sharpe ratio, volatility, and drawdown characteristics. It might not be showing strong returns in isolation but could be helping in terms of risk-adjusted returns when combined with other factors.
