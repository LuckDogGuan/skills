## 帖子正文

1. Focus on signal uniqueness
- Goal: Ensure the alpha captures a unique aspect of market behavior not already covered by common factors.
- Example: Instead of a simple momentum alpha (ts_rank(close, 20)), combine momentum with a surprise factor like earnings revisions:
  alpha = ts_rank(close * earnings_revision_score, 20);

- Why unique: Earnings revisions add a fundamental surprise element missing in plain momentum.

2. Add robustness checks
- Goal: Show the alpha works across time periods, sectors, or market conditions.
- Example: Test the alpha on:
    - Different time periods (e.g., 2010–2015 vs. 2016–2020).
    - Sectors (tech vs. utilities).
    - Market regimes (bull vs. bear).
- How to include: “Tested on USA/D1/TOP3000 with IS/OOS split → stable performance.”

3. Highlight economic intuition
- Goal: Explain the economic rationale behind the alpha.
- Example: “Captures post-earnings drift by ranking stocks with high earnings surprises * recent volume.”
- Why it works: Volume confirms institutional buying after earnings surprises.

4. Optimize parameters systematically
- Goal: Show improved performance via parameter optimization.
- Example: Grid search for ts_rank(close, N) with N = 10, 20, 30 → pick N=20 for best Sharpe.
  alpha = ts_rank(close, 20); // optimized over 10–50 days

5. Compare to benchmarks
- Goal: Show how the alpha outperforms simple benchmarks.
- Example: “Sharpe = 1.8 vs. market index Sharpe = 0.5 in TOP3000.”
- Why it helps: Demonstrates alpha adds value beyond simple strategies.

I like the focus on signal uniqueness and economic intuition — combining momentum with earnings revisions adds a real fundamental edge instead of recycling common factors. The emphasis on robustness (IS/OOS, sectors, regimes) and benchmark comparison also makes the alpha more defensible and less likely to be overfit.

Great checklist for building research-grade signals.

### 评论 #5 (作者: LD50548, 时间: 4个月前)

Great breakdown of improving alpha submissions! I particularly like point 1 about signal uniqueness – combining different data types, like fundamental surprises with price action, is often where truly robust alphas emerge. Have you found any particular combinations of data types or factors that tend to yield more unique signals in your experience?

To prevent overfitting, like in machine learning practice, I feel the In Sample and Out sample (as trading set and test set) test would be pretty helpful, especially for higher frequency signals.

### 评论 #43 (作者: 顾问 RM79380 (Rank 81), 时间: 4个月前)

Strong framework 👍

This is exactly how serious researchers structure alpha validation:

- **Uniqueness**  → avoids factor crowding
- **Robustness**  → reduces overfitting
- **Economic intuition**  → prevents data mining
- **Systematic tuning**  → controlled optimization
- **Benchmarking**  → proves real value

If applied consistently, this materially increases research quality and acceptance.
