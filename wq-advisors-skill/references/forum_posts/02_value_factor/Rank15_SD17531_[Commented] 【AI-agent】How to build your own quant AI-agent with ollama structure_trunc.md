## 帖子正文

Hello there, AI assistants helps us a lot in our work, but AI with very specific knowledge is not that common. So I will introduce how to build your own AI assistant by a simple study case.

Here I will use ollama to deploy my local LLM model, and choose deepseek-r1:8b to run （because the limit of my machine, larger model, better result, so choose the biggest model that your machine could handle）.

1. Load the model locally.

First, search "ollama" and download it on web.

2. When ollama is downloaded, install it. Then, open your terminal to run "ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b" (change the model name if you use different model).

3. When the model loading is completed, you could send messages in your terminal cell and get answers, but that is what we want. What I want is, send very long csv or json data, and a few lines of prompts to let the model work for me. So I need to build a local agent. Here comes the tutorial:

4. Create a python file (end with ".py"). Assume that I have a case to combine operators with certain fields. And now I have the operators in csv file and I have the fields with csv file, too. Then follows the code (I'm Chinese so I use Chinese as annotation, but I also added some English annotation, please use chargpt or other AI tools to translate the annotations that without English version (Actually those not translated annotation are not important : D)):

import csv
import subprocess
import os

# 函数：读取CSV文件，返回字典形式的内容

# Function: read the csv file, return the contents in dictionary.
def read_csv(file_path):
    data = []
    with open(file_path, newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
        for row in reader:
            data.append(row)
    return data

# 函数：构建运算符描述字符串

# Function: find the description of the operators
def build_operator_description(operator_data):
    description = ""
    for row in operator_data:
        operator = row[0].strip()
        rule = row[1].strip()
        description += f"运算符: {operator}，规则: {rule}\n"
    return description

# 函数：构建字段描述字符串

# Function: find the descriptions of the fields
def build_field_description(field_data):
    description = ""
    for row in field_data:
        field = row[0].strip()
        text = row[1].strip()
        description += f"字段: {field}，描述: {text}\n"
    return description

# 函数：生成alpha因子的请求并调用LLM模型

# Funtion: call LLM model to produce alphas.
def generate_alpha_factor(operators_description, fields_description, prompt, output_file):
    # 构造完整的 prompt

# organize full prompt
    full_prompt = f"运算符和规则描述:\n{operators_description}\n字段和描述:\n{fields_description}\n生成alpha因子的要求:\n{prompt}"

    # 调用模型生成结果

# call model to produce results
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["ollama", "run", "deepseek-r1:8b"],
        input=full_prompt,  # 通过标准输入传递 prompt
        capture_output=True, text=True
    )

# 处理返回的结果
    if result.returncode == 0:
        # 将生成的结果保存到指定的文本文件
        with open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write(result.stdout)
        print(f"Alpha因子已保存到: {output_file}")
    else:
        print("Error occurred:", result.stderr)

# 主函数
def main():
    # 输入文件路径
    operator_file = 'your own file path with operators'  # 运算符与运算规则描述文件
    field_file = 'your own file path with fields'  # 字段与描述文件
    prompt = """Your own reqires. You could use double quota if you don't need multi-line prompt.
    """

    # 输出文件路径

# output file path
    output_file = 'generated_alpha_factor.txt'  # 生成的Alpha因子保存为txt文件

    # 读取CSV数据

# read csv data
    operator_data = read_csv(operator_file)
    field_data = read_csv(field_file)

# 构建描述

# run the function about description extraction

operators_description = build_operator_description(operator_data)
    fields_description = build_field_description(field_data)

# 生成Alpha因子并保存为txt文件

# save your alphas as txt
    generate_alpha_factor(operators_description, fields_description, prompt, output_file)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Setting up a local AI assistant using Ollama and a large language model (LLM) offers a lot of flexibility and control, especially for quantitative trading. The ability to process CSV and JSON files directly is a huge advantage when working with financial data, as it enables seamless integration with datasets and quick access to market insights.

Data normalization and time series adjustments are crucial steps to maintain the integrity of your analysis. Normalizing data (e.g., using z-scores or min-max scaling) ensures that different datasets are comparable, while aligning time series data helps avoid discrepancies when performing correlation analyses or backtesting strategies.

One potential challenge with large datasets is memory management and computational efficiency. When handling vast amounts of historical price data or sentiment scores, using batch processing or chunking methods can help maintain performance. Additionally, applying dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can streamline the data without losing critical information.

Have you explored using any specific preprocessing techniques or libraries (like Pandas or Dask) to handle large datasets efficiently?

### 评论 #19 (作者: TP18957, 时间: 1年前)

Building a quant AI-agent using Ollama is an excellent approach for customizing LLM capabilities to financial applications. Your method of processing CSV and JSON data before feeding structured prompts into deepseek-r1:8b ensures an efficient workflow. One potential enhancement could be integrating feature engineering techniques before calling the model, such as applying principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA) to refine input signals. Additionally, for large datasets, leveraging batch processing and memory-efficient libraries like Dask could significantly improve execution speed. It would be interesting to explore how well Ollama handles sequential prompting—perhaps using iterative updates to refine AI-generated alpha factors over multiple steps. Have you considered any optimization techniques to streamline data handling and improve model inference efficiency?

### 评论 #23 (作者: NN89351, 时间: 1年前)

Your approach to building a quant AI-agent with Ollama is impressive, especially the structured preprocessing of CSV and JSON data before feeding it into deepseek-r1:8b. Integrating feature engineering techniques like PCA or ICA before model inference could indeed refine input signals and reduce dimensionality, improving efficiency.

Batch processing and memory-efficient frameworks like Dask are great suggestions for handling large datasets. Additionally, leveraging quantization techniques or low-rank adaptation (LoRA) could further optimize inference speed, especially if running models on limited hardware.

Regarding sequential prompting, iterative updates could refine alpha factors by dynamically adjusting model outputs based on prior responses. A reinforcement learning-inspired approach, where the AI re-evaluates signal effectiveness over time, might be useful.

Have you experimented with reinforcement learning or meta-learning frameworks for dynamically adjusting model behavior based on market regime shifts?

Hello, a very good question.

For now, I just set the system prompt to limit the output format to be json. But to be honest, the output contains lots of meaningless expressions -- which could be filtered out directly by human. So mu suggestion is check the output by yourself, because the main purpose of this stage is to get inspiration from LLM and expand the expressions to more dataset (dataset should be filtered by some rules), not get the expressions directly.

But if you wanna use the expressions directly, I think more functions could be added after the agent, just add rules to filter the legal expressions.
