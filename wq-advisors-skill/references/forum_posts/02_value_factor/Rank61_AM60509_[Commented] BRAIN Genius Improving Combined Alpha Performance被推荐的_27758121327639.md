Thank you for this articles,

In point 2 of tips section 2 (Decrease inner correlation across Alphas), section 2 (Actionable tips to potentially improve Combined Alphas Performance, there is a concept of orthogonality.

If we look at cumulative PnL of an Alpha as a time series random variable, that contains the information of cumulative PnL over time. At each time of the observed period, we have the observation of the cumulative PnL, as shown in the cumulative PnL chart. Then, with 2 Alphas, we shall have 2 random variable CPnL1, CPnL2 that represent their respective Cumulative PnL. If we apply the correlation formulas of 2 random variables, we shall be able to calculate the correlation of CPnL1 and CPnL2 (corr(CPnL1, CPnL2)).

If we look at them as multi-dimensional vectors, then corr(CPnL1, CPnL2) = 1 when CPnL1 and CPnL2 are positively linearly dependent, corr(CPnL1, CPnL2) = 0 when CPnL1 and CPnL2 are perpendicular, and the angle between them is 90 degree (or pi/4).

If we have mutually perpendicular Alphas, then we shall have a system of perpendicular vectors that could be viewed as perpendicular coordinates, And the volume of space they shall cover would be greater than the volume of space that non-perpendicular vectors (with mutual correlation != 0) could cover. Therefore, it is best to find Alphas that are perpendicular so that their combined performance could enhance the most.

Can we look at this visual explanations to facilitate our understanding of Decrease inner correlation across Alphas?

Thank you.

**It reminds me that when you're doing approximation, you have to think about two extremes and then slowly move from condition 1 to condition 2**

**Because ρ is not equal to 1 in reality, it must be less than 0.7, and 0.64 is set as the solution, because root 0.64 = 0.8 n-1/n terms are approximated to 1 first, and it is easier to calculate that it becomes root(1/n + 0.8), which is actually related to the number of samples, that is, the more alpha is paid, the more it will start to converge, that is, the more alpha is paid, the higher the correlation is actually equal to only one alpha And the more low-correlation alpha you can pay, the better 🤣🤣🤣, which is interesting**

### 评论 #32 (作者: 顾问 ZH78994 (Rank 11), 时间: 1年前)

To enhance the combined performance of Alphas, it's crucial to focus on improving the **Out-of-Sample (OS) Sharpe ratio**. Overfitting during the In-Sample (IS) period can result in overly optimistic performance metrics that don't generalize well to new, unseen data. Overfitting can be minimized by leveraging features like the **Test period**, conducting **Robustness Tests**, and ensuring that Alpha expressions are **explainable**.

One common but ineffective approach is adding **noise** to an Alpha in an attempt to reduce correlation. However, this strategy often fails because it doesn’t address the root issue: if the underlying signal weakens, all Alphas may perform poorly in the OS period. A better approach is to achieve **orthogonality**—the degree to which Alphas are independent of each other—by using innovative operators and incorporating diverse datasets. This ensures that the signals are distinct and robust, improving their performance in different market conditions.

Another key strategy for building a resilient Alpha pool is submitting **uncorrelated Alphas in different pyramids**. By doing so, you reduce the risk of simultaneous poor performance in the OS period, which helps improve overall robustness and resilience, especially during drawdowns in any single pyramid.

### 评论 #38 (作者: 顾问 CC40930 (Rank 95), 时间: 1年前)

To improve Combined Alpha Performance and achieve higher tiers in the BRAIN Genius Program, the focus should be on enhancing the Out-of-Sample (OS) Sharpe ratio. Overfitting during the In-Sample (IS) period can lead to misleading performance metrics, so it is crucial to test Alphas on unseen data to ensure they generalize well.

Instead of adding noise to reduce correlation, prioritize achieving orthogonality between signals. This can be done by creatively using operators and leveraging diverse datasets, ensuring that the Alphas remain distinct and robust. Additionally, submitting uncorrelated Alphas across different pyramids can help build a resilient Alpha pool, ensuring that performance remains stable even during drawdowns.

---

### 评论 #42 (作者: AC63290, 时间: 1年前)

To improve Combined Alpha Performance and increase the chances of achieving higher tiers in the BRAIN Genius Program, several strategies can be implemented:

### 1.  **Focus on OS Sharpe Ratio**

- **Key Consideration** : Out-of-Sample (OS) Sharpe ratio is critical because it provides a more realistic performance measure. Relying on in-sample (IS) metrics can lead to overfitting and unrealistic expectations.
- **Action** : Ensure that the Alphas submitted have high OS Sharpe ratios by testing them on out-of-sample data. This helps validate the generalizability of the model and avoid overfitting.

### 2.  **Avoid Overfitting During IS Period**

- **Issue** : Overfitting can result in Alphas that perform well on past data but fail to generalize on unseen data.
- **Action** : Use the  **Test period**  feature to evaluate models on unseen data. Conduct  **Robustness Tests**  to assess the performance consistency across different market conditions, time frames, or random data splits.
- **Action** : Make the Alpha expressions  **explainable**  to ensure they are based on clear, interpretable signals and not just random fluctuations in data.

### 3.  **Ensure Alpha Orthogonality**

- **Avoid Adding Noise to Achieve Lower Correlation** : Adding noise in an attempt to reduce correlation often leads to poor performance across all Alphas in the OS period if the underlying signal is weakened.
- **Action** : Instead of relying on noise,  **focus on achieving orthogonality**  between Alphas by using  **innovative operators**  and  **diverse datasets** . Orthogonality ensures that the signals from each Alpha remain independent, enhancing the overall robustness of the Alpha pool.

### 4.  **Alpha Pool and Pyramid Diversification**

- **Importance of Diverse Alphas** : Submitting multiple uncorrelated Alphas helps in creating a diversified and resilient Alpha pool.
- **Action** : Ensure that your Alphas are uncorrelated and belong to different pyramids to mitigate the risk of significant drawdowns. A well-diversified pool of Alphas ensures stability and better risk-adjusted returns.

By focusing on these key areas, you can improve the  **Combined Alpha Performance**  and, ultimately, achieve a higher tier in the BRAIN Genius Program. This approach ensures that your Alphas remain robust, reliable, and capable of delivering consistent performance in the face of new and unseen market conditions.

Thus, the combine alphas performance is only affected by self-correlation, as it only includes the alphas that I submitted. On the other hand, prod correlation does not affect it. Prod correlation will only affect the value factor, right?

- Submitting uncorrelated Alphas in different pyramids is also essential for building a robust Alpha pool, ensuring resilience to drawdowns in any single pyramid

感谢这篇关于提高综合 Alpha 性能的优秀文章！我非常赞赏您对避免过拟合和实现正交性的强调。确实，过拟合会导致性能指标在样本外数据中泛化性差。使用测试期、进行强健性测试和保持 Alpha 表达式的可解释性都是确保持久性的卓越实践。

我尤其赞赏通过使用创新操作符和多元化数据集来实现正交性的建议。这避免了添加噪声的陷阱，并确保 Alpha 表达式保持独特和健壮。同时，提交不相关的 Alpha 以不同的金字塔形式也是建立强韧的 Alpha 池和减轻单个金字塔中回撤风险的有效策略。

为了进一步探讨这个话题，我对如何平衡创新和强健性感兴趣。您如何决定一个 Alpha 是否“足够不同”以被纳入池中，还是太实验性而无法可靠地为性能做出贡献？是否有任何特定的数据集或操作符被证明是在构建正交 Alpha 时特别有效？

期待听到您的想法和他人的经验分享，共同攀登 BRAIN Genius 的高峰！

我特别感兴趣的是关于 orthogonality 的部分。您解释了如何通过使用多样化的数据集和创新性的操作符来实现 orthogonal 的 Alphas，从而提高 Combined Alpha Performance。

我想问一下，您在实践中是如何选择合适的数据集和操作符的？是否有特定的指标或方法来评估这些选择的有效性？

另外，您是否有任何建议或推荐关于如何构建一个 robust 的 Alpha pool？应该关注哪些特定的指标或 metrics 来评估 Alpha 的性能和稳定性？

谢谢您的帖子和您的时间！我期待您的回复并进一步的讨论。
